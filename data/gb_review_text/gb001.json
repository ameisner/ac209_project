It tries to trump things up with a \u201cplot\u201d about chasing down Dr. Vladimir Chaosky (seriously!) and his henchmen, but that doesn't make scouring a blurry screen full of random junk for a <em>specific piece</em> of junk particularly fun.<br/><br/>You might think that, hey, for $10, you'd at least get a <em>really good</em> photo-hunt game, right? But Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos is barely committed to its globe-trotting concept. You theoretically travel from <a data-ref-id=\"3035-191\" href=\"/san-francisco/3035-191/\" slug=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-877\" href=\"/cairo/3035-877/\" slug=\"cairo\">Cairo</a> and all points in between, but each location is essentially a mildly themed room that's been haphazardly filled with just <em>stuff</em>. Some of it matches the theme of the location, but there's apparently a preponderance of <span>CDs</span> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-329\" href=\"/umbrella/3055-329/\" slug=\"umbrella\">umbrellas</a> the world over. To its credit, there's enough stuff on every screen that you can approach any one location multiple times and not be asked to search for the same things.<br/><br/>There is, however, a very finite number of locations in Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos, and you can easily plow through all of them in an hour and change. You can play it cooperatively with up to four players, either locally or over Xbox Live, and I found this experience slightly more enjoyable, simply because misery loves company. It's rarely very difficult, providing you with a spacious time limit and numerous hints that you can cash in to find the more evasive items. Any difficulty usually comes from the fact that the art isn't quite HD-quality, and attempting to use your in-game magnifying glass just makes it look muddier. <br/><br/>Sometimes, though, the description of what I was looking for was unclear, which eventually lead to me just randomly clicking on stuff and hoping for the best. Maybe this speaks more about my own ignorance, but how am I supposed to discern between a bocce ball and, well, any other type of ball, ever? And since when is \"swift\" another name for a pterodactyl? Occasionally the game just makes inexplicable assumptions about the player's knowledge base. There's one location where you're asked to identify a number of \"changes\" in various pieces of presumably real-world art, though without providing any sense of what the pieces might've looked like before.<br/><br/>It's unsurprising that developer TikGames is primarily known for cell-phone games and casual Flash-type stuff, because that's exactly what Interpol: The Trail of Dr. Chaos feels like.

The cube-dropping puzzle game brought a sense of rhythm and style to the genre that that you don't see too frequently. Since then, the game has been lightly iterated for a number of different platforms, with the latest version landing on the PlayStation 3. This version is a $14.99 digital download called Lumines Supernova. It plays around with the modes a bit and offers options that the other versions don't, but the core game is still the star of the show.</div><br/><div>As you play, you'll complete stages and the entire skin will change. This has an impact on the music (including its tempo), as well as the entire look of the blocks, the background, and so on. Unlocking these different audiovisual styles is the most rewarding part of Lumines, as some of them are pretty spectacular. If you've played the games before, you'll probably recognize some of the skins used here, though Supernova does have some new ones, as well.</div><br/><div>In addition to just playing through and unlocking skins, the game also has a time attack mode, a playlist mode that lets you set up which skins you want to play, puzzle and mission modes, and so on. New to Supernova is a mode called Dig Down, where you have to clear away blocks to empty out a set number of columns before proceeding to the next, more-difficult level. There's also a sequencer that lets you piece together your own background music for a somewhat-custom skin. You'll assemble a 32-bar loop out of prefab bits and pieces of drums, basslines, and so on. When I heard that there was going to be a sequencer in the game, I got all excited. But the reliance on prefab pieces, while easy to use, doesn't give it enough range.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628401-lumines_supernova_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-628401\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/628401-lumines_supernova_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-628401\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/495/628401-lumines_supernova_02.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Breaking blocks to the beat can get mesmerizing.</figcaption></figure>The game also has a multiplayer component, but unlike its Xbox 360 counterpart, Supernova is limited to offline play. The implementation on the 360 wasn't much fun, though, so this isn't a gigantic loss.</div><br/><div>While I think that anyone with a reasonable level of interest in puzzle or rhythm games should absolutely own Lumines, there's really no good reason to collect them all.

While the annual nature of the King of Fighters series doesn't quite make each preceding year totally obsolete, it's tough to go back to a lot of the earlier games in the package, especially when '98 is so much better than its predecessors. So it's hard to justify paying $30 on the PSP and Wii (the PS2 release is only $20), even if you're the sort of 2D fighting aficionado that considers KOF '98 a true classic and one of the greatest games of all time.</div><br/><div>After a brief video intro, you're dumped into a selection screen where you can choose which of the King of Fighters games you wish to play. Or you can opt for a challenge mode, which gives you specific requirements, such as winning a fight with all of the lifebars and other on-screen elements disabled, or a set up where enemies only take damage if your super gauge is completely full. Completing these challenges unlocks artwork and music for you to check out in a gallery. Not to get too far off-track here, but does anyone actually look at unlockable concept art anymore? Zooming in on shoddy scans of promotional posters has never been my idea of a good time, even for games that have plenty of high-quality concept art to consider.</div><br/><div>If you're already familiar with these SNK classics, then you know what you're in for. While never achieving the level of popularity of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3025-331\" href=\"/street-fighter/3025-331/\" slug=\"street-fighter\">Street Fighter</a> games, the KOF series offers up some wonderful 2D fighting with tons of characters, especially in KOF '98, which brings together over 30 different characters without relying on a lot of duplicates or clones. The fights take place in a team battle format, with each side choosing three fighters, then the order in which they'll appear. It's an interesting format because it forces players to learn at least three characters, rather than just relying on one to succeed. The games can get a bit more technical than most other 2D fighters, with multiple ways to use your stocked up super attacks and, occasionally, more-difficult controller motions than the standard \"double fireball\" sort of stuff that's the norm in today's fighters.</div><br/><div>The games in the collection are emulated from the original Neo Geo versions, and they run in arcade mode. The emulation isn't perfect, and it's slightly different between versions. The PSP and PS2 versions of the game stop to load a lot more frequently than the Wii version. The PSP has pretty long load times when jumping into a game, too. For some strange reason, the PSP and PS2 versions have the buttons backwards in their default control settings (which can be easily fixed).</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/678/429597-kof97_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-429597\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.73684210526316\" data-width=\"304\" style=\"width: 304px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:73.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/678/429597-kof97_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-429597\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/678/429597-kof97_3.png\"></a><figcaption>KOF '97 in action.</figcaption></figure>The Wii version is missing a few things here and there, like the red and white flashing that occurs whenever a fight ends in KOF '97. Also, the Wii version offers a lot of different control options for players using a Wii Remote or a Remote plus a Nunchuk. These options are all terrible. The game supports GameCube controllers, but a Classic Controller is the best bet for proper button configuration. Lastly, the Wii version doesn't offer any in-game options for changing aspect ratio. If you have your Wii set to widescreen, the game will stretch out its original 4:3 aspect ratio to fill the screen, forcing you to either reset your Wii's screen setting or adjust your TV if you want things to look proper.</div><br/><div>So no version is perfect, but the faster loading makes the Wii version the best choice, provided you've got the right controllers on-hand. Also, it's nice to get a collection of good, classic 2D fighters on the Wii, which doesn't have a ton of games like this. That said, it's still sort of hard to recommend the collection, especially if you already own KOF '98 in another format. The $30 price point on Wii and PSP is a bit much, and PS2 owners would probably be better off waiting for the updated version of KOF '98, called Ultimate Match, which Ignition is scheduled to release later this year.</div>", "deck": "If you're after some quality 2D fighting, KOF Collection offers that, but the package comes with some caveats that make it a little unappealing.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-103/", "platforms": "PlayStation 2, PlayStation Portable, Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-2374/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-king-of-fighters-collection-the-orochi-saga/3030-2374/", "id": 2374, "name": "The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-01-17 10:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-78152/", "id": 78152, "name": "The King of Fighters Collection: The Orochi Saga"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-lord-of-the-rings-conquest-review/1900-104/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6411/190223-944925_20080717_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190223\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6411/190223-944925_20080717_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190223\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6411/190223-944925_20080717_screen001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Orcs and humans apparently have the exact same character classes.</figcaption></figure>It must be a testament to the pull of the Big Movie License that even when <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20965\" href=\"/the-lord-of-the-rings-conquest/3030-20965/\" slug=\"the-lord-of-the-rings-conquest\">The Lord of the Rings: Conquest</a> was frustrating the hell out of me, I still wanted to like it. But that would have required looking past the awkward, occasionally buggy combat, repetitive mission goals, and bland presentation. And since the game reduces its rich source material to such a bluntly generic fantasy setting, even <em>Lord of the Rings</em> devotees would be challenged to ignore the lackluster mechanics and appreciate the scant fan service on offer. Sadly, the game just isn't that impressive on any level.<br/><br/>Conquest takes most of its cues from the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-696\" href=\"/star-wars-battlefront/3025-696/\" slug=\"star-wars-battlefront\">Star Wars: Battlefront</a> series, which developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1779\" href=\"/pandemic-studios/3010-1779/\" slug=\"pandemic-studios\">Pandemic</a> was also responsible for. It offers four basic classes--warrior, archer, mage, and scout--that fill in the melee, ranged, stealth, and magic needs of any medieval fantasy army. Every capable action hero from the movies (and some less-than-capable ones) also appears as a playable character at some point, each resembling one of the four basic classes with a few specialty moves tacked on. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1535\" href=\"/gandalf/3005-1535/\" slug=\"gandalf\">Gandalf</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6619\" href=\"/saruman/3005-6619/\" slug=\"saruman\">Saruman</a> hurl lightning bolts like the mage. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2280\" href=\"/aragorn/3005-2280/\" slug=\"aragorn\">Aragorn</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4546\" href=\"/witch-king-of-angmar/3005-4546/\" slug=\"witch-king-of-angmar\">Witch King</a> have all the warrior's moves. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1546\" href=\"/frodo-baggins/3005-1546/\" slug=\"frodo-baggins\">Frodo</a> and <span>Wormtongue</span> can go invisible and stab enemies in the back, scout-style. You might recall <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2291\" href=\"/legolas/3005-2291/\" slug=\"legolas\">Legolas</a> is handy with a bow. It's familiar stuff.<br/><br/>All of the battles have a linear A-to-B-to-C progression of objectives taken from a few stock categories, like capture and hold, perimeter defense, destruction of stationary objects, or kill this story dude. But the missions usually degenerate into simple attrition, with both factions throwing their reinforcements against the tide of battle until one side is beaten into submission. That works fine in the sort of team-based online games Conquest is derived from, but here you have a very limited number of lives and thus a limited ability to keep hurling yourself at the enemy in a brute-force attempt to break through. Run out of lives and you play the entire mission again.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6411/190260-946205_20080508_screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190260\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6411/190260-946205_20080508_screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-190260\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6411/190260-946205_20080508_screen002.jpg\"></a><figcaption>At least the bigger battles are kind of exciting, sometimes.</figcaption></figure>Finessing your way to victory would seem like the obvious solution. But that's a tough prospect because the combat is too clumsy and unpredictable. It seemed like no matter what class I was using, I went from full health to dead in an instant several times a mission. In some levels a fell beast or catapult load will come out of nowhere and annihilate you. Another time, deep into a mission, one of Aragorn's lengthy combo animations took him straight into a bottomless pit. Enemies can run whole combos on you when you're on the ground, sacrificing most of your health in one instant. Once, I was even killed by arrows while stuck in a canned Quick Time Event, climbing up the side of an oliphaunt. When it's working as intended, the fighting is just average, but it can get downright infuriating when it all goes wrong.<br/><br/>The single-player campaign is split into two halves. The \"good\" side, the War of the Ring, loosely follows the major conflict arc of the films, taking you to Helm's Deep, Moria, the Pelennor Fields, and the Black Gate, among others. When you finish that campaign, Pandemic takes some creative license and has Frodo succumb to the power of the One Ring. Then the forces of evil regain it and begin backtracking across all those places you visited in the first campaign, with big 12-foot-tall <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1856\" href=\"/sauron/3005-1856/\" slug=\"sauron\">Sauron</a> the Bad-Ass stomping all over the free peoples of Middle-Earth and resurrecting his lieutenants one by one--so you can play as them, of course. Nevermind that he was just a disembodied presence, barely more than an idea in the original story; evil apparently needs not only a face but a big spiked mace to get the point across here.<br/><br/>(I know it's a little late to mourn the watering-down of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> since the movies first started that process seven years ago, but with all the generic fantasy video game trappings going on--wizards running around hurling fireballs and heal spells, Aragorn's kinship with the dead reduced to a brief special attack, even Frodo Baggins backstabbing enemies like a diminutive ninja--it's hard not to notice what a typical Dungeons &amp; Dragons-style fantasy knock-off this game suddenly looks like.)<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6843/870878-lotrconquest3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870878\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54652686762779\" data-width=\"763\" style=\"width: 763px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6843/870878-lotrconquest3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-870878\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6843/870878-lotrconquest3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6843/870878-lotrconquest3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sauron smash!</figcaption></figure> The one thing this game does get right is the epic scope of some of the battles. When you're out on the <span>Pelennor Fields</span> with siege towers and oliphaunts and hundreds of warriors shaking the ground around you, you can actually get caught up in the sort of frenzied battlefield intensity that marked the best combat sequences in the films. But then the oversize bounding box on one of those oliphaunts' tusks catches and kills you in one hit and you quickly remember: Damn, this game is annoying sometimes.<br/><br/>You'd expect Conquest to get better online, but adding human players doesn't alleviate the core problems with the combat; it just forces you to wield them against opponents smarter than the campaign's AI. And strangely, you lose most of that feeling of epic battle, since most of the maps remove the AI fighters and only feature the eight-versus-eight player roster--and the ones that do have any ambient action place the fighting outside of the area you can actually play in. The game offers the most basic multiplayer modes, anyway: control-point-based conquest, capture the ring, team deathmatch, and a TDM variant that only features hero characters.<br/><br/>Before Conquest, it had been long enough since <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4867\" href=\"/the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii/3030-4867/\" slug=\"the-lord-of-the-rings-the-battle-for-middle-earth-ii\">Battle for Middle-Earth II</a> that if you'd asked me, I might have thought EA's license for <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> had finally lapsed. It's still in effect, obviously, and of course I'm not privy to the exact terms of the contract--but if Conquest is indicative of the level of quality and care the company is willing to invest in LOTR-themed games, maybe it's time for them to let someone else give it a try.", "deck": "Frustrating combat and a half-hearted approach to the source material drag down EA's latest Rings game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-104/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20965/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-lord-of-the-rings-conquest/3030-20965/", "id": 20965, "name": "The Lord of the Rings: Conquest"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2009-01-26 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-80415/", "id": 80415, "name": "The Lord of the Rings: Conquest"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/skate-2-review/1900-105/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5461/871187-gb_air.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-871187\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55555555555556\" data-width=\"1152\" style=\"width: 1152px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5461/871187-gb_air.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-871187\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5461/871187-gb_air.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The custom graphics creator lets you do some pretty rad stuff.</figcaption></figure>Skate 2 is the sort of game that flips between Zen-like satisfaction and controller-tossing frustration with no warning. It's interesting, then, that this is a game that you'll be better at when you remain calm and focus on the task at hand, because trying to play with the added pressure of anger or frustration just makes you mess up again and again and <em>again</em>. Not every single facet of Skate 2 is terrific, but enough of it works to make it a great skateboarding game overall, and when it all comes together, it's pretty amazing.<br/></div><br/><div>The most important part of the original Skate has been retained in the sequel without any extreme updates. That part is the right analog stick, used to perform various tricks. Pushing down then up is your basic ollie, cocking it off to the side will do kickflips and heels, sweeping around the bottom lets you do shuvits, and so on. Though there are probably one or two too many tricks on that right stick--making specific trick selection really tough when you start trying to land the more advanced tricks--it feels incredibly natural, and it's the main thing that helped the first game feel different from everything that came before it.</div><br/><div>Rather than scrapping that right-stick functionality, Skate 2 instead builds a series of modifiers around the existing tricks. Using the buttons you use to propel yourself on the ground lets you do one-footed variations of your grabs, for example. A new button lets you grab onto the tops of vertical ramps and other objects for handplants, which you can then tweak around with the right stick or the foot buttons. Landing with a foot out lets you do footplants. You can also get off your board now, which is mainly useful for getting up a flight of stairs. But you can also grab onto some items and drag them around, letting you arrange benches, dumpsters, rails, and ramps into whatever makeshift configuration you like. On paper, the off-board stuff sounds pretty good. In practice, though, the running animation is kind of bad, and the controls for moving and turning while on-foot are absolutely weak.</div><br/><div>It's a good thing, then, that you don't need to get off your board very often. The single-player career mode in Skate 2 is broken up into a number of different paths, and the game doesn't really put a clear focus onto any one of those paths. Despite setting up a bit of cohesive fiction across the three games in the Skate franchise, there's no real story to Skate 2, either. The setup is that you're the skater from the first game who just came off of a five-year prison stint for attempting to skate down the city dam of San Vanelona. Since then, San Van has been ripped apart and rebuilt due to some unexplained natural disasters. So you'll enter New San Vanelona and, if you played the original, you'll probably recognize some of the general geography. But the city feels almost completely different. There's also a few mentions of an evil corporation--MongoCorp--that hates skaters. But aside from the same type of security guard presence as the first game and the addition of skate-stoppers on some rails and ledges (which you'll have to pay to get pried off), there's no overarching Skaters vs. The Man plot that drives things along, either. You get out of jail, skate a lot, get on the covers of some magazines, maybe buy some land to add additional skateparks to the world, and that's sort of it.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9747/449109-skate2e1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-449109\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.61779242174629\" data-width=\"1821\" style=\"width: 1821px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9747/449109-skate2e1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-449109\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9747/449109-skate2e1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dyrdek's challenges ask you to gesture while you do grinds and drop into banks.</figcaption></figure>That lack of focus isn't necessarily a bad thing, though, because it ensures that you'll usually have multiple things to work on at any given time. You can pose for photos and eventually appear on the cover of <em>Thrasher</em> and the <em>Skateboard Mag</em>. You can take on challenges laid out by other pro skaters in order to earn sponsorships from their companies. You can wager money on hill-bombing death races and eventually earn the title of \"King of the Mountain\" with an unlockable crown to match. You can seek out 22 different spots in the world and attempt to beat their set score to \"own\" said spot. There's a series of street and vert competitions. Or you can go on bonus missions with pro skaters like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5352\" href=\"/rob-dyrdek/3005-5352/\" slug=\"rob-dyrdek\">Rob Dyrdek</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9355\" href=\"/danny-way/3005-9355/\" slug=\"danny-way\">Danny Way</a>. Or you could just, you know, skate. The list sort of goes on from there, but you get the idea. There's plenty to do in Skate 2, and the different objectives require you to excel at the game's different disciplines.</div><br/><div>A lot of the challenges can be pretty difficult, depending on which parts of Skate 2's control scheme you've mastered. For me, the game sort of breaks any time you're asked to perform specific tricks. There's an entire section of Skate 2 devoted to playing S.K.A.T.E. with other pro skaters. They perform a trick, then you must match it exactly to keep the pressure on them to perform. But the window between doing the right trick and the wrong trick is exceedingly narrow due to the high number of tricks mapped to the right stick. While there may be some folks out there with a steady enough thumb to do an inward heelflip 100 percent of the time, I'm more like 30 percent. So the pro goal where you play against Eric Koston and Mike Carroll--who don't mess up very often--is essentially impossible. The rest of the game's challenges can get frustrating and take forever to complete, but that has the additional impact of making them exceptionally rewarding to complete. After spending the first several hours absolutely sucking at the game, eventually everything clicked, and I was able to quickly blaze through the entire single-player game--with the exception of the aforementioned pro challenge and two others.</div><br/><div>While the single-player structure hasn't changed that much from the original game, Skate 2's multiplayer has been significantly bolstered. The different competition modes from the first game return, letting you enter contests for the best trick, score-based jam sessions, races, turn-based spot battles, S.K.A.T.E. contests, and Hall of Meat mode, where players take turns trying to thrash themselves the hardest. These contests allow up to six players to compete, and when you play in ranked games, you earn experience that goes toward raising your online ranking. You'll also earn money for your performance, and this cash feeds back into the single-player to let you purchase additional clothing and accessories. A lot of this stuff just sort of exploits the spots and competitions that you'll see in the single-player, just online. About the only thing missing is a three-on-three team battle for points, which you'll find in one part of the career. This might have made a nice option for an online variant.</div><br/><div>But the competition side of Skate 2 is a small part of Skate 2's online options. There's also a freeskate component where you can just jump into one of the game's areas with a handful of other skaters and just, like, skate. There are also freeskate challenges that often require cooperation to complete, and these feel a lot like the multiplayer challenges found in Burnout Paradise. There are 149 challenges in all, and much like they did in Burnout, they add a huge hook to the multiplayer that could keep you coming back. Of course, the cooperative nature of some of these--there are a handful that ask the group to all perform the same trick at the same time, for example--make them only work when you're in a group of skilled skaters that you can trust to be on their game. Attempting these challenges with a group that isn't up to par results in disappointment more often than not.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/535066-s1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-535066\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56237623762376\" data-width=\"505\" style=\"width: 505px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/535066-s1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-535066\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/535066-s1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/535066-s1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll see a lot of fisheye lens in Skate 2.</figcaption></figure>The online side of Skate 2 also lets you share things with other players. Like the previous game, you can edit together quick video clips and snap photos that can be shared online. The game has a decent rating system for this content that helps keep the cool stuff at or near the top of the list. Players can also find or create custom graphics on the game's official site using a set of basic tools. While you can't just import your own JPEG files or anything like that, the tools are good enough to create some really awesome stuff if you're willing to spend some time with it. If you're not feeling artsy, though, you can use the website to grab the stuff that other players have made and put it into your game.</div><br/><div>The other big creation thing in Skate 2 is the ability to create your own spots and share them with others. You do this while playing the career mode, and it essentially lets you draw a big scoring box around anything you want. Then you need to set a baseline score for that area by doing your best trick there. Once created, you can upload the spot to the game's servers, and created spots can be browsed and downloaded just like replay videos. The game keeps scoreboards for created spots, lets you download a ghost run of the leader's performance, and when you're done you can rate the spot, as well. There are tons of different places to skate in New San Vanelona, and the created spot browser is a really smart addition that keeps things nice and competitive.</div><br/><div>Visually, the most impressive part of Skate 2 is still its animation. The game treats the flipping of the board and the placement of a player's body with the utmost respect, and Skate 2 continues the trend of having the most realistic skateboarding trick animations around. The city itself looks good, also, but there are certain things, like grass textures and the occasional pedestrian, that look pretty bad. Also, the frame rate in both the 360 and PS3 versions occasionally get choppy, but the reasons behind the drop don't immediately seem clear. When installed on a 360 hard drive, I noticed that the random frame rate drops seemed to happen a bit more frequently, but I'm no hardware researcher, so I can't say with certainty that this will be the case for everyone out there.</div><br/><div>The game contains the same sort of eclectic soundtrack as the original Skate, staying away from the typical overly-aggressive mall punk you'd expect in favor of stuff from artists like WAR, Sam &amp; Dave, Sly &amp; The Family Stone, Public Enemy, Judas Priest, ELO, Dragonforce, and the Wu-Tang Clan. The skaters turn in passable voice performances, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8773\" href=\"/giovanni-reda/3005-8773/\" slug=\"giovanni-reda\">Giovanni Reda</a> returns as the game's announcer. I expect some may find his shtick to be excessively grating, but I find him sort of funny.</div><br/><div>While the career mode of Skate 2 lacks focus, the open-ended nature of it works out pretty well, and the additional online components really add a lot to the overall experience, as well. Some players may find the difficulty or the open progression a bit overwhelming at times, but the advances in the trick system and the new ways to play make Skate 2 a great sequel that further capitalizes on the concepts introduced in the original.</div>", "deck": "Skate 2 makes a load of interesting changes to the structure of the average skateboarding game and includes enough interesting multiplayer options to keep players going for awhile.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-105/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20661/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/skate-2/3030-20661/", "id": 20661, "name": "Skate 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-01-26 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-75092/", "id": 75092, "name": "Skate 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-maw-review/1900-106/", "description": "<p style=\"\">I'm a fan of Pixar movies. With the exception of maybe <em>Cars</em>, I am willing to shell out the hard cash for a few hours of some cute, though occasionally biting, humor. That's probably why I'm a fan of Twisted Pixel's new downloadable title, The Maw. Taken purely as a game, it's noticeably short and you'll mostly be running around doing some light platforming and hitting button prompts. Ah, but as entertainment, The Maw delivers that kind of wholesome, fuzzy charm that leaves you smiling and completely satisfied.\u2028\u2028<br/><br/></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/628/813862-the_maw_screen_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-813862\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/628/813862-the_maw_screen_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-813862\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/628/813862-the_maw_screen_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Actions definitely speak louder than words in The Maw.</figcaption></figure>The brief introduction takes place aboard what, I assume, is some kind of futuristic, alien cargo ship en route to an intergalactic zoo. The game has no real dialogue or exposition, opting instead to communicate everything you need to know through its highly expressive characters. It's in this would-be detention block that you'll first meet the game's main protagonist, Frank. \u00a0The multi-pupiled Frank is probably the chattiest fellow you'll encounter in the entire game, with a vocabulary amounting to two words: \u201cMaw\u201d and \u201c<em>Maaaaaaaaaaaaaaawwwwwwwww</em>.\u201d Luckily for him, and you, Frank becomes fast friends with another, more jello-like alien, named...Maw. Talk about a perfect match. \u00a0I suppose the relationship between the two is more akin to a boy and his dog than a pure friendship, as Frank will be subsequently dragging Maw around any given level on what is essentially a high-tech leash for the remainder of their time together.<br/><br/>\u2028\u2028Immediately after this brief introduction, the ship crashes and you and your friend-dog, Maw, find yourselves marooned on a rather odd planet. As Frank, you seem to excel at being an exceptionally nice guy. But the nice-guy-mechanic is not what progresses you through the game's lovely, yet brief, few levels. Instead you'll be making use of Maw's ability to inherit special talents from the creatures he'll be constantly devouring. If Maw eats one of the local fiery lizards, for example, he'll gain the ability to breathe fire, obviously. If he eats one of the multi-eyed-peacock-ostrich things, he gains the ability to shoot lasers from his eyes...obviously. These special traits are used to progress through the level, usually by solving some puzzle that disables a barrier or turret which has been deployed to block your path. Oh yeah, those guys that originally captured you are still around, and they will be trying to hinder your progress until the very end of the game. \u2028\u2028<br/><br/>As Maw continues to eat the various indigenous creatures he'll periodically increase in size, which, I have to say, is awesome. He'll go from being around the size of an alien fire hydrant all the way up to...well...I don't want to spoil it, but let's say, <em>rather large</em>. A larger Maw can eat larger creatures and eating enough creatures will allow you to progress to the next level. This formula doesn't vary too much, but gaining each new ability and, to some extent, increasing Maw's size, is always a treat. Maw's physical appearance will change according to what he's eaten and he'll even exhibit some tweaks to his personality. It's all extremely adorable, and if that description makes you want to punch a kitten in the face, then I suggest you not play this game. \u2028\u2028<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/628/813863-the_maw_screen_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-813863\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/628/813863-the_maw_screen_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-813863\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/628/813863-the_maw_screen_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Set Maw free dude! No blood for Maws.</figcaption></figure>While Maw is busy eating things and endearing himself to your inner child, you'll be guiding Frank as he finds ways to fatten up his buddy and progress to the next area. Frank's fancy laser leash not only drags poor Maw around, but it's what you'll use to interact with the environment. Occasionally, you'll be asked to move some heavy rocks, yank a creature out of the ground, or even hurl various objects into each other. Along with the minor platforming, none of this is very challenging and you'll often be prompted for the correct button press when a new action is required, but it's interesting enough to keep you engaged during your brief stay with the game.<br/><br/>The whole game won't last you more than a couple of hours, maybe a little longer if you're really trying to eat everything in sight. After completing the game you can go back to any level and and try to devour anything you missed, but since there are so few levels, you won't be very taxed in doing so. Really, this game is all about its personality and your willingness to lose yourself to its charm.

Buckets of blood spill out as you hack enemies in half with your blade, and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89768\" href=\"/samuel-l-jackson/3040-89768/\" slug=\"samuel-l-jackson\">Samuel L. Jackson</a>\u00a0turns in some sharp voice work in a dual role as both the lead character and as Ninja Ninja, the lead's alter-ego who talks about what's really going on with plenty of character-appropriate cursing. If the actual action could back all this up, Afro Samurai could have been a great game. But repetitive action, camera troubles, and boss fights that feel like they were designed by someone who actively hated the rest of the game step in and mess up what starts out feeling like a perfectly good time.<br/></div><br/><div>The story of Afro Samurai the game is taken from <em>Afro Samurai</em> the anime, a five-episode arc that focuses on the lead character seeking vengeance against the man who killed his father. Naturally, you run into a lot of obstacles along the way in the game, and the game also takes a few liberties with the original story to better fit it into a game. The general progression has you moving from place to place in a linear fashion, hacking up hordes of ninjas, androids, and other foes. The game has a combo system that's reasonably deep, but unnecessarily so. You'll do just fine by mashing away on the two sword attack buttons. You can also drop into a slow-mo focus mode, and charged up attacks here can split enemies in half. The catch is that the enemies will try to dodge the attack, so you'll have to aim your sword strikes a bit before unleashing them. This leads to cool moments like cutting off the legs of a ninja who jumped in hopes of avoiding your slash, or catching enemies at diagonal angles because they tried to dodge to the side, and so on.</div><br/><div>The action of cutting up enemies is exciting, though it's never too challenging, either, so it starts to get repetitive. The attempts to break up the core action leads to a handful of boss fights. Most of these fights aren't so great, instead forcing you to rely on simple tricks or attempting to properly time esoteric moves that are rarely handy outside of one specific fight, like Afro's ability to reflect bullets or split rocket-propelled grenades with his sword. The boss fights don't always give you great feedback when it comes to instructing about what it wants you to do, and these moments are also usually the spots with the most annoying camera issues, too. It might be enough to make you quit playing before you've seen the conclusion.</div><br/><div>The game also forces a few platform-style jumping sequences on you. Here, you'll at least have control of the camera, but rotating around to figure out where you're going next, or missing some minor jump because you couldn't see it properly make this part of the game a bit of a dud.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/228716-afro_screenshots_070708_09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-228716\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/228716-afro_screenshots_070708_09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-228716\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/228716-afro_screenshots_070708_09.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll do a lot of fighting in villages like this one.</figcaption></figure>Looking at Afro Samurai purely from a gameplay angle makes it sound pretty bad. Also, it doesn't last particularly long, as the stats screen claimed I had been playing for around five hours when I completed it. But there's something to the game's style that makes it stick out. The models and environments sport a nice set of textures that give parts of it a hand-drawn feel, and the multitude of ways that you can separate your enemies' body parts keep the fighting fresh. A few breakout moments, like one where you're fighting a sword-toting robot while you're both falling out of the sky, help the game stand out, as well. Of course, the audio is also a nice addition. The music is listed as being \"inspired by\" The RZA of the Wu-Tang Clan. While not every track is a hit, and you'll hear a bit too much repetition from the music, it sets the mood appropriately. The voice acting is also very good. Samuel L. Jackson has the most dialogue, and he shines as the foul-mouthed Ninja Ninja. The rest of the cast also does well, and even though the basic enemies utter the same phrases a bit too often, there's something about hearing an enemy shout \"motherfucker!\" as you're cutting him in half that never gets old.</div><br/><div>Afro Samurai achieves a decent balance, providing enough style and combat to work more often than it doesn't.

To be fair, it <em>looks</em> like the sort of game your eight-year-old niece or nephew might tote around at all times in <em>their</em> DS. But the saccharine-sweet veneer of former <em>Electronic Gaming Monthly</em> editor <a data-ref-id=\"3040-27013\" href=\"/shawn-smith/3040-27013/\" slug=\"shawn-smith\">Shawn Smith</a>'s <a href=\"http://www.shawnimals.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Shawnimals</a> universe hides a charming little tower defense game that's both endearingly clever and startlingly addictive.</div><br/><div>If you're new to tower defense, the genre is built around wave after wave of different enemy types that come streaming down a path toward a goal you have to stop them from reaching. To do this you build structures in predefined spots around the pathway that spew various sorts of offensive units to counteract the strengths of each kind of enemy. There's a rock-paper-scissors sort of balance going on with characters that specialize in melee, ranged attacks, area-of-effect, and so on. Despite Ninjatown's lighthearted appearance, the potential strategy can get elaborate enough to be satisfying.</div><br/><div>In Ninjatown your offensive units are, well, ninjas of various stripes. You've got hand-to-hand and ranged ninjas--with cutesy names like wee ninjas and sniper ninjas--to cover the basics, but then you get into the more unusual and amusing unit types. The business ninja attacks with a frenzied sales pitch, cell phone in hand, distracting and slowing down enemies. Lava ninjas throw fireballs, setting enemies ablaze and doing damage over time. You can sell one ninja hut to recoup some cookies (the game's currency) in order to quickly build a different type of hut. That's a must, because you can only see what kinds of enemies are approaching one or two waves into the future. So it's less about setting up a long-term strategy in each mission and more about quickly adapting your defenses to the kinds of enemies that are rolling in moment to moment.</div><br/><div>On top of the many ninja fighters, you've got a few other offensive capabilities. The whole Ninjatown clan battles under the tutelage of the crusty but capable Ol' Master Ninja, who can unleash some devastating special attacks involving the touch screen and stylus when you've earned enough \"happiness\" from defeating enemies. Actually, the entire game is fully stylus-controllable, which absolutely works in its favor. You employ the stylus like you would a mouse, tapping on ninja huts to pull up menus for upgrading units and setting waypoints and attack preferences. I did prefer scrolling the viewpoint around with the d-pad, but otherwise it's wonderfully efficient and easy to navigate the battlefield and lay down your units using just the stylus.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/791711-942940_20081028_screen017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-791711\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14097/791711-942940_20081028_screen017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-791711\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14097/791711-942940_20081028_screen017.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can't help cracking a smile at dialogue like this.</figcaption></figure>Ninjatown is already a great tower defense game, so it's just a bonus that it's also well-written and sometimes really funny. There are a lot of unusual personalities fighting the fight against the minions of Mr. Demon--the nefarious grouch who's trying to steal Ninjatown's famous ninja cookie recipe--and they drop in before each level with all kinds of offbeat quips and referential humor. You can skip the pre-mission dialogue scenes, but you shouldn't (nor will you want to) because they're fully worth seeing, and laughing at. It's all lighthearted and silly in a lovable sort of way.</div><br/><div>My only real knock against Ninjatown is, well, it ends. The story mode's 36 missions ought to last you a good while, and you're ranked in each one, so you can always go back and try for better performance in each one. The multi-cart multiplayer mode offers a well-designed head-to-head mode on eight maps where you both face identical streams of enemies, with some interactivity in between. (There's also a three-map version of this available with a single cart.) But the game is the most fun when you're facing off against a previously unseen level, having to scramble to construct the right defenses fast enough to stave off each wave. Since the game is rendered in really simple 2D sprites and tile-based levels (which really fit with Shawnimals' trademark art style), I feel like a random mission generator or, even better, a stylus-based level editor would have provided more longevity. Because I'd like to carry this one around with me from now on, just to battle through the odd new level here and there occasionally.</div><br/><div>Don't judge Ninjatown by its cover. It's funny and clever in a way that grown-ups can appreciate, and the increasingly complex strategy is engrossing and challenging enough to keep you coming back right up to the very end.</div>", "deck": "Equally long on endearing personality and challenging strategy, this stylus-driven tower defense game makes a great travel companion in bite-size chunks.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-108/", "platforms": "Nintendo DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22801/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ninjatown/3030-22801/", "id": 22801, "name": "Ninjatown"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-02-12 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-79161/", "id": 79161, "name": "Ninjatown"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/r-type-dimensions-review/1900-109/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/732681-r_type_dimensions4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-732681\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/732681-r_type_dimensions4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-732681\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/732681-r_type_dimensions4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>We need more level-spanning multi-part bosses in the world today.</figcaption></figure>Those of you who spent a lot of time and quarters in 1980s arcades will probably remember <a data-ref-id=\"3025-419\" href=\"/r-type/3025-419/\" slug=\"r-type\">R-Type</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-461\" href=\"/irem-corp/3010-461/\" slug=\"irem-corp\">Irem</a>'s side-scrolling shooter notable for its anatomically suggestive enemies and teeth-gritting difficulty. The original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13745\" href=\"/r-type/3030-13745/\" slug=\"r-type\">R-Type</a> and its first sequel, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19750\" href=\"/r-type-ii/3030-19750/\" slug=\"r-type-ii\">R-Type II</a>, are back in a new $15 Xbox Live Arcade package called <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22998\" href=\"/r-type-dimensions/3030-22998/\" slug=\"r-type-dimensions\">R-Type Dimensions</a> that brings along some nice updates like pretty, high-def 3D graphics and simultaneous cooperative play. That painfully maddening degree of challenge hasn't gone anywhere, though.<br/><br/>Let's be honest here: R-Type, in its original arcade form, is not made for normal people. It's not the kind of fast-paced action game where dynamic reflexes and deft on-the-fly strategy will save your ship from the nonstop hail of enemies, bullets, and lasers. You can't maneuver your way out of tight spots, because if you're in the wrong place at the wrong time, you are dead, simple as that. You just aren't fast enough to dodge or outrun the obstacles in a lot of cases, and every death is a relatively major setback. It's the kind of unreasonable difficulty that will frequently make you want to hurl controllers across the room--and since most controllers these days don't come on cords, it could get dangerous and costly to satisfy that urge.<br/><br/>Getting good at R-Type is mostly a matter of memorization, playing and dying and replaying until you know exactly where the enemies are going to come from and what weapon you should be using in any given section of each level. It's kind of like beating your head against a brick wall until you finally break through it. That kind of game design may have filled plenty of developers' coffers with quarters back in the '80s, but unless you're a real stalwart fan of this genre, it doesn't play as well today when you've already spent your money on Xbox Live and you just want to sit down and enjoy the game.<br/><br/>Good thing Dimensions' developers realized that R-Type's original gameplay style--called classic mode in this compilation--was going to turn off a large part of the potential audience, so they came up with a much more forgiving alternative, infinite mode. Classic works on a checkpoint system, so when you die, the game drops you back at the last one you hit with no power-ups. If classic had been the only mode in Dimensions, I probably never would have finished either game. It's just that demanding.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/732731-r_type_dimensions11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-732731\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/732731-r_type_dimensions11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-732731\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/732731-r_type_dimensions11.jpg\"></a><figcaption>R-Type has gotten a great visual update in Dimensions.</figcaption></figure>Infinite mode gives you a kinder, gentler R-Type that respawns you immediately when you die, with no break in the action. (Ironically, just like a lot of other shooters did in the first place.) This certainly makes the two games shorter; you could probably play through both of them in about an hour, while I spent more than that just trying to learn and get through the fourth stage of R-Type alone on classic. But it's great that both varieties of gameplay are in here, playing to different skill levels and tastes.<br/><br/>There's a startling number of big and small additions to round out this package. The most obvious is the full 3D facelift Tozai applied to both games. It faithfully reproduces the art style of the originals while layering in the expected level of eye-popping effects, pretty glowing light sources, and so on. The best part is you can toggle between the old 2D and the new 3D instantly at the touch of a button, which is great for the sake of comparison.<br/><br/>But that's just the beginning of the visual updates. You can also play the game in a tiny thumbnail embedded in an in-game arcade cabinet, or you can have the 3D mode offset its camera angle so you're sort of looking down the long hallway of a given level. Those features are fun novelties that eventually seem pointless if you're trying to play the game skillfully. Lastly, there are some fun graphics filters for those of us with a nostalgic bent, allowing you to drop the resolution and color depth in various ways to slap a more pixellated, color-banded look on the new 3D graphics. They really went above and beyond on the graphics front.<br/><br/>Tozai also added two-player simultaneous play for the first time, which is another way to make the ludicrous difficulty a little more manageable. You can play co-op on Xbox Live, but the second player slogged through an unfortunate degree of lag in all the games I tested. In a game that requires split-second timing, <em>any</em> degree of lag can often be too much, so you'd likely be better off playing two-player on the same console for the proper experience.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/732655-r_type_dimensions2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-732655\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/732655-r_type_dimensions2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-732655\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/732655-r_type_dimensions2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/732655-r_type_dimensions2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Don't even ask.</figcaption></figure>Even the Xbox-specific stuff in here is handled well, with achievements that reward you for skill-based tasks (beat the first level using only the charged beam shot) as well as ones that you'll get simply by grinding through the game multiple times (collect 500 power-ups, kill 30,000 enemies). This game is also like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23112\" href=\"/the-maw/3030-23112/\" slug=\"the-maw\">The Maw</a> in its exemplary handling of the profile-level goodies that you can unlock in some Live Arcade games. In this case, there are two gamer pictures up for grabs, and you'll be notified in the relevant levels where you can get them. You can even go back to the main menu later and download them again if you delete them for some reason. This surely sounds like small, small potatoes, but most games don't even notify when you've opened up a new gamer picture, much less give you the chance to install it again in the event of storage disaster.<br/><br/>Side-scrolling shooters have been on the endangered genres list for years and years now, but somehow they keep limping along with just enough major releases to prevent extinction.

TGC, with its roots in the world of game-design academia, has covered this sort of art-house ground before on PSN with the abstract eat-or-be-eaten petri dish simulation <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15849\" href=\"/flow/3030-15849/\" slug=\"flow\">flOw</a>, a one-trick pony that presented a unique starting premise and then failed to do much with it. By contrast, Flower starts big and gets bigger, offering a real sense of progression that reaches a delightful crescendo in the game's final moments. It's one of the most gorgeous games I've ever played and, though brief, is well worth playing once and coming back to later even at the $9.99 asking price.</div><br/><div>It takes about one minute to learn how Flower works. The game's six levels (or \"dreams\") are tied together by a hub interface consisting of your drab, depressing urban apartment, and each stage is preceded by some washed-out scenes of life in the metropolitan rat race. That backdrop provides a stark contrast to the rolling green hills and thousands of flowers that make up the lands you'll be zooming through when you actually play the game.</div><br/><div>You play the part of the breeze--though what you're really controlling is the camera's perspective--which is marked by the swirl of petals you pick up from each and every flower as you fly by it. The controls couldn't be much simpler. You steer your view by tilting and rotating the controller, and you hit any button to pick up forward momentum. You can't quite turn on a dime, but you get used to the feel of the movement quickly enough.</div><br/><div>Certain colors of flowers in each level act as triggers that affect parts of the environment. There's no heads-up display cluttering all that visual splendor, though, so in general, you're just encouraged to explore. In some levels, the right flowers will restore vibrant color to a washed-out landscape; in others, they'll clear a canyon of rocks so you can go zooming through, or start up some windmills to power nearby streetlights. It's always gratifying to see what varied effects you can have on each level, even if it only takes very basic exploration to enact them.</div><br/><div>Even when you're just flying around aimlessly, Flower is a real sight, literally exploding color onto your screen from one moment to the next. Your tail of petals can get enormously long and varied if you spend enough time in a level, and picking up speed and doing a quick turnaround can result in you flying right through the middle of it, filling your screen with colors swirling on the wind. Buzzing the ground is also a treat, the way the wind cuts a narrow trough through the tall grass as you speed along. Musical notes are keyed to a lot of the flowers, too, so you're often immediately and dynamically adding to the already jaunty soundtrack as you fly around. The game is a true audiovisual tour de force, giving you the sense that things like 1080p and HDMI are good for more than just marketing bullet points.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/886894-level_2_stills_1211.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886894\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/886894-level_2_stills_1211.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-886894\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/886894-level_2_stills_1211.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of Flower is bleaker than you might expect.</figcaption></figure>Flower could have gone the same way flOw did, with a succession of one lightly enjoyable naturalistic level after the other till you had no more levels to play. It would still be a decent and visually beautiful game if it had. But in the back half, the level design takes you down an unexpectedly darker turn, juxtaposing all that floral jollity with bleaker, dystopian imagery that allows for a couple of twists on the gameplay, too. This unexpected last third of the game really elevated it to a more impressive height, for me. You could extract some environmentalist themes from the latter part of the game with little effort if you wanted, but you're also free to just get lost in the almost overwhelming sensory experience Flower provides.<br/><br/>You can finish Flower in a small handful of hours, but that initial experience is so densely packed with visual splendor and engaging discovery that every minute of it feels meaningful. It's not a bad way to relieve stress, either, just slumping back on the couch after a long day at the office and zooming around fields full of lush flora without a bunch of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-454\" href=\"/locust-horde/3015-454/\" slug=\"locust-horde\">Locust</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-113\" href=\"/nazis/3015-113/\" slug=\"nazis\">Nazis</a> trying to score head shots on you. And the game's trophies are thoughtfully designed, too, encouraging you to go back and play the levels again more skillfully if you're the type of person who's interested in boosting your online rep.<br/></div><br/><div>Download services like the PlayStation Store are the best thing to happen to consoles in a long while. They make offbeat experimental games like this one possible, when such games would likely never reach shelves in boxed form due to the raw business realities of retail publishing. But because we can circumvent the obstacles of physical distribution, we can have games like Flower, a tiny, beautiful, elegantly designed piece of software that I feel richer for having played.</div>", "deck": "The latest PSN release from thatgamecompany is full of incredible floral imagery and a few unexpected twists.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-110/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21120/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/flower/3030-21120/", "id": 21120, "name": "Flower"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-02-11 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-81023/", "id": 81023, "name": "flower"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fear-2-project-origin-review/1900-111/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6382/218141-project_origin_pics_31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-218141\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6382/218141-project_origin_pics_31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-218141\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6382/218141-project_origin_pics_31.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Happy birthday!</figcaption></figure>With games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18911\" href=\"/the-operative-no-one-lives-forever/3030-18911/\" slug=\"the-operative-no-one-lives-forever\">No One Lives Forever</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-726\" href=\"/shogo-mobile-armor-division/3030-726/\" slug=\"shogo-mobile-armor-division\">Shogo</a> in its past, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-864\" href=\"/monolith-productions-inc/3010-864/\" slug=\"monolith-productions-inc\">Monolith</a> has a long history of developing highly atmospheric games.

This might be a disappointment for those looking for something cerebral, but the high-impact weaponry, moody visuals, and frenetic pacing make F.E.A.R. 2 a viscerally satisfying ride.<br/><br/>F.E.A.R. 2 puts you in the role of a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7292\" href=\"/michael-becket/3005-7292/\" slug=\"michael-becket\">Sgt. Michael Becket</a>, a member of a separate F.E.A.R. team than the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-430\" href=\"/fear-point-man/3005-430/\" slug=\"fear-point-man\">Point Man</a> from the original. Despite playing as a different character, you've got the same slow-motion and jump-kickin' abilities, something that's addressed over the course of the story. The game picks up just before the first game left off, allowing you glimpses of the climax of that game before heading off on your own mission to find and stop <a data-ref-id=\"3005-429\" href=\"/alma-wade/3005-429/\" slug=\"alma-wade\">Alma</a>, the tragic, psychically charged young woman whose thirst for revenge against the <span>Armacham Corporation</span> has laid waste to much of the city. Much like Monolith's queasily pugilistic <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20465\" href=\"/condemned-2-bloodshot/3030-20465/\" slug=\"condemned-2-bloodshot\">Condemned 2: Bloodshot</a>, F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin spends a lot of time revealing the truths behind the mysteries and conspiracies established in the original, often through memos and other bits of intel scattered throughout the environments. A fear of the unknown is what drove the first game, but somehow it's even more disturbing to see just how far-reaching and sinister the grand conspiracy is. If this is your first dip into the F.E.A.R. crazy-pool, the game does a decent job of catching you up to speed, and a quick look at our <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4800\" href=\"/fear-first-encounter-assault-recon/3030-4800/\" slug=\"fear-first-encounter-assault-recon\">wiki page</a> should sufficiently fill you in on the rest.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6382/218116-project_origin_6_m.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-218116\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54375\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6382/218116-project_origin_6_m.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-218116\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6382/218116-project_origin_6_m.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This is probably way easier and way more fun than actually piloting a mech.</figcaption></figure>Your mission to stop Alma puts you at odds with the high-tech private army of the Armacham Corporation, psychically controlled clone soldiers that have gone rogue, and of course, Alma herself. She'll randomly pop up to puree other characters or drive them crazy, but mostly she just comes at you with unnerving-but-harmless visions. There are a few jump-scares in F.E.A.R. 2, but most of the creepy stuff is just part of the ride, with minimal impact on the gameplay. Even in this passive capacity, the Alma-induced visions still have a significant influence on the game's unique visual flair. One of the more significant critiques against the first F.E.A.R. was a sense of monotony in the environments, which seemed to consist almost exclusively of office buildings and quasi-military compounds, and the environments in F.E.A.R. 2 are significantly more diverse. It still kicks off in an average-looking office hallway, though it's not long before you're battling your way through apocalyptic city streets, a deserted elementary school, and derelict subway systems. Still, part of the aesthetic of the F.E.A.R. series is the contrast of mundane, recognizable environments with surreal hallucinations and meticulous viscera, something F.E.A.R. 2 delivers in a variety of ghastly ways.<br/><br/>Aside from all the spooky ghost stuff, one of the defining characteristics of F.E.A.R. was the tactical style of the gameplay. AI opponents would intelligently flank you, flush you out with grenades, find cover, or make their own cover by flipping over tables and such. While the enemies in F.E.A.R. 2 are still pretty good about protecting their own hides, the game itself is so generous with your time-slowing reflex ability, ammo for your totally kick-ass weapons, body armor, and health packs, that it feels much more run-and-gun. Compounding this issue is that F.E.A.R. 2 is a phenomenally linear game, with only a few rare moments when it even seems like you have more than one path to take. In a way, I actually prefer the more-focused, more-forgiving style of F.E.A.R. 2, simply because it makes it easier to really appreciate the crazy atmospheric effects and gorgeous gore that are on display. A sequence where you get to pilot a massive mech suit--a moment that echoes Shogo--is a perfect example of what F.E.A.R. 2 is all about. There's little challenge to it, but the way it's presented, with its glitchy video-screen effects, the swirling trails of your cluster missiles, and the hydraulic moans of the suit itself, really puts you in the moment. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/301411-205488_4_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301411\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"576\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/301411-205488_4_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-301411\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2352/301411-205488_4_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2352/301411-205488_4_2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hey, you've, uh, got a little something on your face.</figcaption></figure>Aside from the brisk, aggressively cliffhangery single-player experience, F.E.A.R. 2 offers some online multiplayer options as well, though it feels a little by-the-numbers when compared to the bloody, hallucinogenic story mode. It supports up to 16 players and features standard-issue modes like deathmatch, team deathmatch, capture the flag, control point, and an objective-based bomb/disarm mode. You can modify your weapon load-out before a match, and change between three preset load-outs in between spawns. There's an online ranking system, but that doesn't earn you much more than bragging rights. The most interesting part of F.E.A.R. 2's multiplayer is probably the presence of those big-ass mech suits from the single-player game in the Armored Front mode, though it's such a murderous piece of gear that it seems like the only reliably effective way to counter it is with another mech suit. It's one of those things that's better in concept than in practice. <br/><br/>I honestly think there are few developers today with both the technical and creative chops to establish such a specific tone as Monolith does so successfully with F.E.A.R. 2.\u00a0 Even though the ghost-story stuff ends up being about as threatening as a trip through The Haunted Mansion at Disneyland, and the tactical gameplay is softened up by an abundance of player-boosting pick-ups, F.E.A.R. 2 still puts on one hell of a show.", "deck": "It's less tactical than its forebear, but Monolith delivers a tightly paced and atmospheric ride with F.E.A.R. 2.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-111/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20663/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fear-2-project-origin/3030-20663/", "id": 20663, "name": "F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-02-12 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-76913/", "id": 76913, "name": "F.E.A.R. 2: Project Origin"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/retro-game-challenge-review/1900-112/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6059/307996-20080716_retro_game_challenge_2_dsf_ec_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-307996\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6059/307996-20080716_retro_game_challenge_2_dsf_ec_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-307996\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6059/307996-20080716_retro_game_challenge_2_dsf_ec_03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Cosmic Gate has a lot of Galaga in it.</figcaption></figure>Retro Game Challenge has an awesome premise. Sent back in time and returned to your youth by an evil game master, you're forced to play a set of faux-eight-bit games to get <a data-ref-id=\"3025-42\" href=\"/back-to-the-future/3025-42/\" slug=\"back-to-the-future\">back to the future</a>. It's neat because the developers have created a bunch of new games that feel like old, lost NES-era releases. But rather than playing these games straight, you're basically forced to grind out achievements in each title to move from one to the next and, ideally, get one step closer to freeing yourself from the evil game master's grip.</div><br/><div>So it's like a retro compilation of games that never existed, with enough structure to give it all some meaning. The game quality is decent, but the variety is where I started to lose interest. You're presented with one game at a time, and you must complete four challenges, in order, before moving on to the next. So you'll be seeing a lot of the same game over and over again as you complete one challenge, then have to start your game over to work on the next. I usually found myself bored after completing half the challenges in a game, but still had to drag my way through the rest. Most of the games have cheat codes that are revealed to you through an in-game magazine, which can make progressing through the challenges a bit easier. But since most of the games aren't good enough to play outside of the challenge system, cheating through the challenges sort of defeats the purpose of the entire product.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6059/307974-20080713_game_center_cx_ec_dsf_17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-307974\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6059/307974-20080713_game_center_cx_ec_dsf_17.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-307974\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6059/307974-20080713_game_center_cx_ec_dsf_17.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Guadia Quest will remind you of Dragon Quest in spots.</figcaption></figure>The games themselves are funny and clever enough to work on their own for a bit. Your first challenges come from a game called Cosmic Gate, which is essentially a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15784\" href=\"/galaga/3030-15784/\" slug=\"galaga\">Galaga</a> clone. From there you move through character action platformers like Robot Ninja Haggle Man, and a drift-focused racing game called Rally King. Then it's back to another shooter, this time a scrolling, Star Soldier-like game called Star Prince. After that, the game seriously lets you down by serving up Rally King again in a special \"SP\" format and then you're given Robot Ninja Haggle Man 2, which is more of the same. Rehashing concepts within the context of the game manages to serve as a bit of sly commentary on the sameness and sequel-focused nature of game design, but it doesn't make actually playing Retro Game Challenge any better as a result. The game does pick up a bit later on with Guadia Quest, a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16305\" href=\"/dragon-warrior/3030-16305/\" slug=\"dragon-warrior\">Dragon Quest</a>-like RPG with appropriately clunky menus and dialogue.</div><br/><div>The wrapper that sits around the classic games is what you'll see on the bottom screen of the DS. It's two kids, huddled around an old game console. You can go to your shelf to view the games you've opened up, read their manuals, or read game magazines that sometimes have tips on the games you're playing, previews of upcoming games you'll unlock, and a host of weird references to real-life game writers like \"Johnny England\" and \"Dave H.\" Even the magazine itself is called <em>GameFan</em>. If you didn't see enough game magazines throughout the 1990s, the references will probably be lost on you, but the text throughout is reasonably clever either way.</div><br/><div>Retro Game Challenge is a great concept, but the execution makes things more tedious than they needed to be. If it were a bit more open-ended about which games you could play at any given time and didn't double-up on some of the games, it'd be a pretty cool little collection. But once I got finished playing a game I really didn't want to play anymore only to be faced with a \"new\" version of a game I had already unlocked, the spell was broken and the rest became simple, repetitive grinding.</div>", "deck": "Retro Game Challenge has some awesome concepts behind it, but it gets painfully repetitive in spots, which throws a wet blanket on an otherwise-charming game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-112/", "platforms": "Nintendo DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21465/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/retro-game-challenge/3030-21465/", "id": 21465, "name": "Retro Game Challenge"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-02-13 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-80506/", "id": 80506, "name": "Retro Game Challenge"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/sonics-ultimate-genesis-collection-review/1900-113/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/794738-shinobiiii_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794738\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.57951706910908\" data-width=\"1201\" style=\"width: 1201px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/794738-shinobiiii_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794738\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/794738-shinobiiii_3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yep, Shinobi III is up in there. The infinite health and shuriken codes still work.</figcaption></figure>With individual emulations of old arcade and console games being served up on a somewhat regular basis via the digital distribution networks of each console, you might think that the collections and compilations that we saw during the last console generation would be obsolete. Why sell a pack of 30 or 40 games for $29.99 when you can sell one game for five bucks? On that note, it's kind of cool to see a big collection of 16-bit Sega games, with a handful of other arcade versions and interviews thrown in for good measure. If you're way into old Genesis games and don't currently have any other way to play them, this \"ultimate\" collection is a pretty solid choice.</div><br/><div>But it's not just any \"ultimate collection.\" This is Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection, a particularly awful name because it makes you think this is a collection of Sonic the Hedgehog games. It isn't. In fact, despite the inclusion of Sonic &amp; Knuckles along with the previous Sonic games, you can't use the \"lock-on\" feature that allowed Genesis owners to play as Knuckles in Sonic 3 or Sonic 2. Instead, this is a collection of Sega-published Genesis games with an \"extras\" section that has some unlockable games from arcades or the Sega Master System.</div><br/><div>There are just under 50 games in all and they cover a good, wide set of genres. The classic action stuff is well-represented by a slew of Sonic the Hedgehog games, the complete Streets of Rage trilogy, four Golden Axe games, a few Shinobi games, and a couple of VectorMan games. You'll also find some role-playing and strategy, with four Phantasy Star games and three games from the Shining series. The emulation on the Genesis games is fine, and by default Ultimate Genesis Collection shows you the games in their original 4:3 format, drawing a themed background that will fill the rest of your screen. If you're the type of dope who likes to stretch things out, you can easily ruin the way the games look by making them take up the entire screen. You can also ugly things up with a smoothing filter that is also off by default. With these few, bad options available and the main focus of the collection being its ability to emulate games from 1989-1996, the back-of-box copy that states it has \"ENHANCED HD GRAPHICS\" is completely stupid and absolutely misleading.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/794869-sonics_ultimate_genesis_collection.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794869\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/794869-sonics_ultimate_genesis_collection.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-794869\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7439/794869-sonics_ultimate_genesis_collection.jpg\"></a><figcaption>So did Sonic pick these games himself or what? Does he hate Sub-Terrania or something?</figcaption></figure>The emulation on the arcade games is a bit spotty. The most notable issue is Space Harrier, which plays well enough but has numerous audio issues that make it sound completely different from the way the original game sounds. Considering how great the sound was in the original--and how long Space Harrier has been emulated just fine in other open-source projects--this just makes the whole thing feel a little lazy. Also, there are enough multiplayer games in this pack that the lack of online functionality is a noticeable omission.</div><br/><div>You'll find a few extras on the disc, including a few video interviews with people who worked on the original games. So if you're interested in hearing Japanese Sega employees wax nostalgic about the development of Ristar or about... the development of Phantasy Star Universe? Yeah, that doesn't really fit.</div><br/><div>For me, Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection had me at Fatal Labyrinth. This sort-of-crappy dungeon crawler was one of my favorites back when it was new, and for whatever reason, I still enjoy it today. Chances are, if you played a lot of Genesis games, there's at least one game in this collection that you feel this way about, and at least one missing game that will seem like a horrible, glaring omission. Either way, it's hard to argue with its relatively cheap price, and 49 games for $30 is a pretty good deal... even if the Space Harrier audio is totally jacked.</div>", "deck": "For what Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection lacks in quality, it at least partially makes up for by its sheer quantity of emulated games.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-113/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24218/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sonics-ultimate-genesis-collection/3030-24218/", "id": 24218, "name": "Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-02-16 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-81385/", "id": 81385, "name": "Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/street-fighter-iv-review/1900-114/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176567-sf4_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176567\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176567-sf4_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176567\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/176567-sf4_04.jpg\"></a><figcaption>When C. Viper isn't yakking away on her phone she can be a formidable opponent.</figcaption></figure>Street Fighter IV is one of those games that makes me glad I'm not a game developer. Dealing with franchises that are beloved by the world, making dramatic changes to classic formulas, attempting to thread the needle between a wide, mainstream audience and an insatiable collection of die-hards... it's probably not too easy. And that's what makes Street Fighter IV that much more impressive. Smart choices were made at almost every turn, and the final result is an absolute masterpiece that will appeal to longtime fans as well as the people who haven't thrown a fireball since 1993.<br/><br/> Street Fighter IV gets back to basics in a lot of ways. If you played <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8161\" href=\"/street-fighter-ii-turbo-hyper-fighting/3030-8161/\" slug=\"street-fighter-ii-turbo-hyper-fighting\">Street Fighter II Turbo: Hyper Fighting</a> to death and then sort of drifted away from the genre, you'll probably be able to jump right back in after a little refresher course. The original 12 characters from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-243\" href=\"/street-fighter-ii/3030-243/\" slug=\"street-fighter-ii\">Street Fighter II</a> are present, and there are 25 characters in all. The rest of the roster pulls in a pair from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6665\" href=\"/super-street-fighter-ii/3030-6665/\" slug=\"super-street-fighter-ii\">Super Street Fighter II</a>, a few from the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-960\" href=\"/street-fighter-alpha/3025-960/\" slug=\"street-fighter-alpha\">Alpha</a> games, and a collection of new fighters. From a gameplay perspective, the new characters fit in just fine. From a look-and-feel angle, though, guys like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4988\" href=\"/el-fuerte/3005-4988/\" slug=\"el-fuerte\">El Fuerte</a>, the lucha libre chef, feel a little out of place. Likewise with the big, bobbling belly with appendages that is <a data-ref-id=\"3005-353\" href=\"/rufus/3005-353/\" slug=\"rufus\">Rufus</a>. But while they may look and act like comedy characters, they aren't total jokes when you're at the controls. Also not a joke? <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7785\" href=\"/gouken/3005-7785/\" slug=\"gouken\">Gouken</a>, a fighter who has appeared in the Street Fighter storyline before, but makes his first appearance as a playable fighter here. As <a data-ref-id=\"3005-433\" href=\"/akuma/3005-433/\" slug=\"akuma\">Akuma</a>'s brother, he's the good guy to Akuma's raging demon badness.

Sure, the old standbys still work. If you want to pop from a low forward into a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-120\" href=\"/fireball/3055-120/\" slug=\"fireball\">fireball</a>, you still can. But there's some new stuff in IV that really changes the game once you start getting into it. The biggest difference is the addition of the focus attack. This chargeable move will absorb an incoming attack and can also be charged to deliver an unblockable attack that stuns your opponent, ideally setting you up for some free hits. You can also cancel into a focus attack out of a special (at the expense of some of your super meter) and cancel out of the focus attack with a dash. There are two meters that charge over the course of a fight. The super meter charges as you do moves and lets you do pumped-up EX versions of your specials or a reasonably devastating super combo. There's also a revenge meter that fills as you take damage. When it reaches a certain point, you can perform an ultra combo, which is usually a hyped-up, more damaging version of a character's super. Each option has its place, obviously, and it's up to you to figure out when to employ them.<br/><br/> So what do you do if you can't quite figure out when and where to employ those techniques? Or, to be more direct, what do you do when everything I said in the previous paragraph sounds like meaningless jibber-jabber? Ideally, that's what the game's trial mode would teach you, as its main focus is to help people get better at the game. But it doesn't teach you anything about theory, the hows and whys of the way the game functions, or even basic stuff about when you can safely jump in on someone and when you shouldn't. Instead, the trial mode gives you a list of moves to perform, starting with the absolute basics, moving on to simple cancels, and eventually getting into some lengthy, difficult combos. If you already understand the basics, this mode will let you pick up some deadly combos. But it doesn't even meet you halfway and let you view the moves being performed before you attempt them, leaving things like working out the timing of the combo to you. If you already know how to play the game, it won't be an issue. But if you already know how to play the game, all you'll take away from it are a bunch of new combos that, depending on your skill level, you may or may not be able to actually complete. It's sort of frustrating, because if this mode were more fleshed out, it might help complete neophytes understand the core concepts behind canceling from one move into another.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/698211-190.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-698211\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55439330543933\" data-width=\"956\" style=\"width: 956px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/698211-190.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-698211\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/698211-190.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/698211-190.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>E. Honda is... displeased.</figcaption></figure>The rest of the game's features are fairly standard, with the sorts of versus, survival, time trial, and training-against-dummies modes you'd expect from a fighting game. They're done up a bit differently here, though, with survival and time trial offering different levels of play with different goals to attain. You'll have to play a lot of arcade mode, as there are quite a few characters to unlock. In arcade mode, you'll get to see some short anime clips that bookend each character's trek through the mode and give the game more of a story than Street Fighter has presented in-game in the past. These range from serious, main-plotline clips about the nature of the game's final boss, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-355\" href=\"/seth/3005-355/\" slug=\"seth\">Seth</a>, to fairly whimsical stuff from characters that don't tie in as deeply, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-271\" href=\"/e-honda/3005-271/\" slug=\"e-honda\">Honda</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6\" href=\"/zangief/3005-6/\" slug=\"zangief\">Zangief</a>. If you're just bent on unlocking characters, you may want to set the difficulty all the way down and play one-round fights to get it done quickly. It's also worth noting that the easiest difficulty setting is practically like playing against an empty controller. If you've had trouble with fighting game AI in the past, you still shouldn't have any serious trouble getting through the game. Of course, it can play pretty rough, as well, if you want to turn the difficulty up a few notches.<br/><br/> While fighting the game's AI can make for a fine time, the very nature of fighting games all but requires you to play against a human opponent. While you can certainly do that locally, the real draw of Street Fighter IV is its online play. As with anything played over a network, there are a lot of different factors that can hamper the game's ability to play smoothly, but other than a couple of typical, minor hitches, the online seems to work fantastically. For the most part, it's the typical ranked/unranked setup, but there's also a way to configure your arcade mode games to allow players to butt in with fight requests, which is a cool function that sort of replicates the arcade experience. A championship mode patch added a sort of ladder-like tournament setup to the online mode in the console releases, and this mode shipped by default in the PC version of the game. It's interesting because it doesn't require you to assemble a full tournament bracket before starting to fight. It just sort of assembles the brackets on the fly as you partake in tournament matches.<br/><br/> Online, you can present yourself via a title and an icon. You unlock additional titles and icons by performing certain tasks. So, for completing a trial stage with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-102\" href=\"/sagat/3005-102/\" slug=\"sagat\">Sagat</a>, you might earn the \"Password is 'Tiger'\" title. There are 16 pages of different titles to get, and once you start playing online, you seem to just start racking them up. Same goes for icons, which range from little leaves that denote some basic level of experience to a baby chick, to a picture of a joystick, and so on. The game doesn't really specify how these items are unlocked, so people on the hunt for all of them will have a lot of work ahead of them.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9726/267880-943711_20080715_screen020.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-267880\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9726/267880-943711_20080715_screen020.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-267880\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9726/267880-943711_20080715_screen020.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9726/267880-943711_20080715_screen020.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Seth can be bad news.</figcaption></figure>Probably the most impressive part of Street Fighter IV's visual style is its facial animation. Unlike a lot of other polygonal dudes out there in video game land, the characters in Street Fighter IV have a lively look to their faces that makes them stand out. It's especially noticeable during the startup of an ultra combo. The player on the receiving end of the ultra usually freaks out, with bulging eyes and a dropped jaw as if they can't believe what's about to head their way. Taking people out with an ultra also usually looks great, from the facial expressions to the huge sunburst effect that fills the screen. Moreover, the game seems to match its arcade counterpart in every way that matters. The PC version of the game also offers three addiitonal graphical filters that let you play around with the way the fighters look.\u00a0They're fairly subtle, with one adding a bit of an ink effect that hovers around the edges of the fighters, another giving the characters a watercolor-like palette, and posterize effect that flattens the look of the characters out a little bit. Watercolor is probably the most striking, but I prefer the default look of the fighters.<br/><br/> The audio portion of Street Fighter IV might be a bit off-putting for some players at first, but you're given enough options to straighten things out to your liking. The game's main menu and intro is set to music that sounds like some kind of boy band nightmare. The worst part is that \"Indestructible\" is incredibly catchy, and it's been sort of half-stuck in my head for around 10 days or so. It's also worth mentioning that the character voices have all been recorded in English as well as Japanese. Now that doesn't mean that you're going to hear <a data-ref-id=\"3005-103\" href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\" slug=\"ryu\">Ryu</a> shouting \"dragon punch\" instead of \"shoryuken,\" but the between-fight banter is spoken in English by default. Also, all of the fight voices have been recorded twice, so Ryu will say \"shoryuken\" differently depending on which voice actor is on the mic. After completing the game once, you can set any of the fighters to Japanese on an individual basis, so if you think it's wrong that Akuma's voice sounds a lot like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1859\" href=\"/blanka/3005-1859/\" slug=\"blanka\">Blanka</a>'s, you can opt for his Japanese track. I initially assumed I'd despise all the English acting and snob out like a purist, but most of it's just fine.<br/><br/> My only real complaint about Street Fighter IV is that the trial mode represents a missed opportunity to help brand-new players get into the game, and perhaps the genre, as well. I only know what I know about Street Fighter because I've been playing and watching it since the early 1990s. Will it take 20 years for new players to acquire the same bits of knowledge that I have? The good news is that Street Fighter IV is a game so great that playing it for that long doesn't immediately sound out of the question.", "deck": "Street Fighter IV combines old and new in powerful ways, resulting in a game familiar enough to bring retired fans back into the fold while being different enough to appeal to the players who have stuck with the genre since day one.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-114/", "platforms": null, "game": null, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-07-07 13:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/50-cent-blood-on-the-sand-review/1900-115/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/189/234429-945617_20080327_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234429\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/189/234429-945617_20080327_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234429\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/189/234429-945617_20080327_screen001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Getting up close lets you trigger melee kills.</figcaption></figure>When <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2614\" href=\"/50-cent/3005-2614/\" slug=\"50-cent\">50 Cent</a> hit internationally back in 2003 with the release of <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">Get Rich Or Die Tryin'</span>, there was a fire and intensity to him that almost seemed supernatural. Here was a man who, unlike the gangsta rappers of the past, genuinely looked the part and had the past to match--how many times did you hear some news report rattling off the fact that he had been shot nine times? He was packaged, pushed, and marketed perfectly, setting him up as some kind of over-the-top supergangster, harder and smarter than any of the rappers to come before him. For a time, it worked. He was the biggest thing going. He was the latest in a long line of pop culture that makes parents squeamish and makes the kids get wild.</div><div><br/></div><div>After a few years of huge fame, though, 50 lost a step. His impact diminished. Chalk it up to whatever you want, from the unrealistic and ridiculous expectation that gangsta rappers somehow continue to \"live their lyrics\" to an increasing focus on his other business interests, but these days, 50 Cent comes off as a weird parody of the image he personified so well only a few years before. In light of the watering down of 50 Cent and his continuing struggle to remain relevant, his second foray into console games is probably the hardest, toughest-sounding thing 50 Cent has put his name on in years.</div><div><br/></div><div>That doesn't mean that 50 Cent: Blood on the Sand isn't just as ridiculous as a lot of the other stuff that 50's been doing lately, though. Or that it's as great as his music can be. Blood on the Sand is a big chunk of often-hilarious nonsense, putting 50 and the G-Unit against a <a data-ref-id=\"3035-179\" href=\"/unnamed-middle-easternmuslim-country/3035-179/\" slug=\"unnamed-middle-easternmuslim-country\">nameless nation</a> of Middle Eastern criminals as the crew attempts to recover a diamond-encrusted skull given to him as collateral for a $10 million debt owed after they play a show in an impossibly war-torn nation. As you've probably already guessed, the skull gets jacked at the very beginning of the game, giving you a clear objective to strive for right off the bat. If the skull had some sort of hokey supernatural power, this whole thing would just sound like a rejected script from an old G.I. Joe cartoon, but the story isn't played up for laughs. Well, it isn't played up for <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">intentional</span> laughs, anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>The story is mostly nonsense, with a lot of half-assed dialogue that's usually delivered by people who sound like they have a plane to catch. 50 Cent and the G-Unit--that's <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7605\" href=\"/tony-yayo/3005-7605/\" slug=\"tony-yayo\">Tony Yayo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7604\" href=\"/lloyd-banks/3005-7604/\" slug=\"lloyd-banks\">Lloyd Banks</a>, and <span>DJ Whoo Kid</span> in case you're keeping score--do most of the in-game talking via some chatter between characters and a taunt button that lets you curse at the people you're shooting at as they die. Even though you can purchase additional packs of taunts with in-game currency as you play, most of the taunts sound kind of forced and are largely unimaginative. The amount of cursing is obviously appropriate, and it's great the the developers pull very few punches on the language, but with that kind of carte blanche, I was left wishing they had come up with better M-rated quips than \"fuck you, pussy!\" Though Tony Yayo does threaten to end his foes' \"whole generation\" from time to time.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/189/234433-945617_20080327_screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234433\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/189/234433-945617_20080327_screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234433\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/189/234433-945617_20080327_screen002.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yet another helicopter battle.</figcaption></figure>The game itself is a competent-but-repetitive Gears of War clone. You can take cover behind walls, blind fire around or above your cover, and dive to quickly get out of the way when required. The shooting is reasonably satisfying, though it's a little too easy to rack up head shots without using a scoped weapon due to the extreme accuracy of the pistols and assault rifles. This makes the rest of the arsenal, like shotguns, machine pistols, and full-on machine guns feel like a huge waste of time. The game has a combo system of sorts that rewards you for killing in quick succession, getting headshots, getting kills while not behind cover, getting kills while you're injured, taunting while you kill someone, and really just about any other \"man kills another man\" scenario that the game allows. At the end of each section, your score is tallied and medals are given out accordingly, leading to the unlocking of concept art and music videos.</div><div><br/></div><div>Playing Blood on the Sand is most enjoyable when playing with a friend. The game always has you playing as 50 Cent with any one member of the G-Unit serving as your sidekick. Online, a human player can join up and take control of that sidekick, once again letting us live the dream of filling Tony Yayo's considerable shoes. Not to dwell too much on the voice acting, but the developers seem to have recorded identical dialogue for each one of the three sidekick characters, making them completely interchangeable. While they constantly address 50 as \"50\" in every single line of dialogue they spit, 50 never says his current partner's name. It makes all three members of the G-Unit seem impossibly needy, and this turned out to be one of the weird things about Blood on the Sand that actually made me enjoy it just a little bit more. I kept envisioning scenarios where Yayo and Banks were fighting over who would be the one to get 50 a bottle of Vitamin Water out of his jewel-encrusted platinum mini-fridge and other struggles for Papa 50's attention.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game isn't difficult, and when it does manage to progress beyond the standard run-and-shoot formula, it's only to interrupt things with a few lifeless vehicle sequences or to pit you against a missile-spewing helicopter. I lost count, but you either fight four or five helicopters over the course of the game, and they're all taken down in the exact same fashion--with your rocket launcher. The last meaningful thing you do in the game? Fight yet another helicopter. You get the impression that this game could have either cut down on repetition for a shorter, tighter experience, or that the developers should have spent more time on unique encounters against meaningful foes.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/189/234437-945617_20080327_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234437\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/189/234437-945617_20080327_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-234437\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/189/234437-945617_20080327_screen004.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/189/234437-945617_20080327_screen004.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>I still think this game would have been better if you fought Rick Ross at the end.</figcaption></figure>Blood on the Sand has a collection of appropriate, nice-looking environments, from torn-up urban areas to a movie theater that happens to be on fire as you're working your way through it. Things like animation and the character models are also fine, though there isn't a lot of enemy variety across the game. The game has passable facial animation in its pre-rendered cutscenes, but in-game, all the characters have stiff, zombie-like faces that don't animate at all, not even when they're speaking lines of dialogue. Between that, and a few other rough edges, parts of the game sort of look unfinished.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game's soundtrack primarily comes courtesy of 50 Cent's back catalog, with over 40 tracks in all, some as recent as his most recent solo release, <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">Curtis</span>, with others like <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">Wanksta</span> and <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">In Da Club</span> dating back to his initial splash. The game's packaging touts \"18 exclusive new tracks,\" but none of the exclusives really jumped out at me at all. Plus some of the songs that aren't already album cuts have been released online as random diss tracks or other mixtape fodder. The music just sort of plays at all times. While the freedom to manipulate the song list isn't an awful idea, there are enough iconically gangsterous tracks in this game that saving one or two of them specifically for boss fights or other high-tension situations might have made the entire game feel a bit more cinematic.</div><div><br/></div><div>Parts of this 50 Cent adventure are downright enjoyable, but I think the most enjoyment I got out of Blood on the Sand came ironically. The action is pretty generic, but it's functional enough to keep you moving from one bout of unintentional comedy to the next. Will 50 Cent get his skull back? Who will double-cross him next? How many instances of \"motherfucker\" can you put in one video game? If you have a soft spot in your heart for thuggish braggadocio and don't mind playing through something that resembles a weird mix between <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18777\" href=\"/the-club/3030-18777/\" slug=\"the-club\">The Club</a>, you'll probably enjoy discovering the answers to these questions.</div>", "deck": "There are moments of questionable quality sprinkled throughout 50 Cent's latest video game adventure, but if you're looking for something silly and totally over-the-top, Blood on the Sand is actually kind of hilarious.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-115/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20454/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/50-cent-blood-on-the-sand/3030-20454/", "id": 20454, "name": "50 Cent: Blood on the Sand"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-02-24 08:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-81406/", "id": 81406, "name": "50 Cent: Blood on the Sand"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/killzone-2-review/1900-116/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/903622-sev.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-903622\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.13\" data-width=\"300\" style=\"width: 300px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:113.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/903622-sev.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-903622\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/903622-sev.png\"></a><figcaption>You'll play as Sev.</figcaption></figure>At this point, the tale of Killzone 2's long march to market has become the stuff of legend. I can't imagine anyone thought that a simple trailer, debuted at E3 back in 2005, would reach this sort of mythical status, and that the anticipation for the final product would become so ridiculous. While plenty of people will spend plenty of time dissecting Killzone 2 and trying to decide if it \"lives up to the hype\" or some such nonsense, all that really matters is the final, core transaction. Killzone 2 is $60. Should you pay $60 to play the content contained on that shiny little Blu-Ray? Yeah, you probably should.</div><div><br/></div><div>So we've already established that this game is worth playing. But if you're the sort of person that's going in expecting some kind of deep story with important characters and numerous twists and turns, you'll probably be a little disappointed. The single-player is straightforward and absolutely to-the-point as you, an ISA soldier, partake in an invasion on the Helghast homeworld. There isn't a ton of dialogue, and most of what you see consists of basic military orders. Go secure the convoy. Go secure the bridge. Let's take it to the Helghast. It's functional enough to keep you pointed in the right direction without spending too much time introducing you to characters, the world, or the conflict. The exception is that the game makes some half-hearted attempts in the back third of the campaign to make it personal. But with next to no time being spent on building your soldier, Sev, or his allies up as three-dimensional characters, it's pretty hard to care when things go bad on them. It's sort of a shame that there isn't more character or plot development, as the conflict between the ISA and the Helghast seems really interesting. You'll just have to go outside the game to learn more.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/198803-killzone_09_small.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198803\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/198803-killzone_09_small.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198803\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/198803-killzone_09_small.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll encounter plenty of opposition in the campaign.</figcaption></figure>While the events that transpire during Killzone 2 don't feel particularly impactful, the minute-to-minute gameplay helps make the campaign worth seeing. Your battles against the Helghast forces look outstanding and play well. You'll encounter a good variety of weapons along the way that should let you play the game the way you like to play shooters. I'm a big headshot guy, so the default assault rifle, with its dot sight and high accuracy, was my go-to weapon for the entire game. Of course, ammo for that thing doesn't last forever, so you'll encounter a Helghast version of the assault rifle, along with a shotgun, a submachine gun, a rocket launcher, a sniper rifle that requires you to hold the controller still for steady aim, and so on. Though you don't encounter it very frequently, there's also a lightning gun that'll chain electricity between multiple soldiers. Though a lot of fun to use, it's not the most practical firearm. Since you can only hold one primary weapon at a time, you need to be wise about what you carry into battle... though there are so many guns laying around on the battlefield that you'll rarely have to turn to your backup piece, a lowly pistol with infinite ammunition.</div><div><br/></div><div>The campaign takes you through a great-looking variety of messed up environments as you hunt down stolen nukes and attempt to seize the enemy's stronghold. The game's effects really help sell the Helghast homeworld as a total hellhole, with just about everything that resembles nice, civilian architecture already reduced to some form of rubble. High winds circle and swirl dust and smoke in the air, giving the entire game a hazy look that helps convey the feeling of being on the battlefield. That haze makes distant enemies a little tough to see at times, which makes for a great, dreadful atmosphere. Even when you're marching straight across a bridge, you're never quite sure where the enemy is going to be coming from next. Once you've spotted the enemy, they're never too tough to deal with as long as you're a straight shooter.\u00a0The AI isn't fantastic, but it makes up for that with quantity, and--if you're playing on a harder difficulty setting--accuracy and resiliency, as well.</div><div><br/></div><div>The campaign makes for a fun ride and will probably fall between the eight- and 12-hour mark for most players. While you'll unlock a fourth difficulty by beating the game, the real replay value comes from Killzone 2's multiplayer mode. If I broke it down into mission types and number of classes, the online portion of Killzone 2 would sound pretty standard. It's the way that all of this is built and presented that makes it special.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/198798-killzone_04_small.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198798\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5338/198798-killzone_04_small.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-198798\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/198798-killzone_04_small.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5338/198798-killzone_04_small.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hey, watch out for that.</figcaption></figure>Online, Killzone 2 is a team game for up to 32 players. Rather than breaking each different way to play out as a separate mode, everything is mushed together and presented on the fly. So the game may start with an assassination mission, where one team is trying to kill one specific player on the opposing team. At the end of that, there are a few seconds of downtime, and then the game launches into the next mission type. Sometimes you'll get something simple, like five minutes of team deathmatch. Sometimes you'll have to attack or defend positions, play one-flag capture-the-flag, take control points, and so on. At the end of each phase, the winning team gets one point. At the end of the match, the team with the most points wins. It's a clever way to keep things fluid and prevent the player base from breaking down and rallying around one or two types at the expense of the others. Though if you find yourself wanting something specific, the server launching menus give you a great deal of control over which missions appear, which weapons are allowed, and so on.</div><div><br/></div><div>Player advancement is also a big part of the multiplayer. When you first get going, you're a low-ranked soldier with very few options. You won't be able to access any of the different classes and weapons. That might sound like a drag, but it works out pretty well by forcing new players to get comfortable with the basics before letting them sign up to be a medic, an engineer, a saboteur, and so on. As you rank up, you'll earn the additional classes and be able to play a more functional role in battles. The classes are pretty standard in their abilities and limitations. Engineers can create turrets, but are limited to shotguns. The medic can carry the default assault rifles, but gains the ability to revive downed players. Tacticians can create mobile spawn points to give the team a forward position in battle. Scouts can cloak themselves, saboteurs can disguise themselves, assault gets heavier armor... you get the idea. As you play, you'll also earn ribbons and badges that reward your play with additional abilities, so medics can eventually drop health kits, engineers can repair ammo dispensers, and so on. There are also bonuses that aren't class-specific that will give you more starting ammo, more grenades, more points during certain mission types, and the like. All of this gives players a lot of different badges and upgrades to shoot for as they wage war across the game's eight maps. If you like, you can check out your unlocked gear by playing with up to 15 bots offline. Bots can also get in on multiplayer matches, if that's your thing.</div><div><br/></div><div>Controlling Killzone 2 feels a bit different from other first-person shooters, as the turning radius has a bit of weight to it. You can't just snap around at a moment's notice. This is something the first game had, as well, but it doesn't feel as cumbersome here. The animation still looks great, but it doesn't come at the expense of your control over the action. In the campaign you'll come across a few spots where you're asked to use the motion control of the Sixaxis to turn valves or plant explosives. It's a bit weird and feels clunky the first time you encounter it, but once you know to expect it a few more times, it's fine.</div><div><br/></div><div>Killzone 2 successfully iterates upon the formulas and standards of console first-person shooters in ways that make it feel fresh, and it does all that while looking absolutely outstanding. If you're the least bit interested in first-person shooting and you own a PlayStation 3, Killzone 2 should be near the top of your list.</div>", "deck": "Killzone 2 offers terrific class-based multiplayer that will keep you coming back long after the campaign is finished.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-116/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20601/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/killzone-2/3030-20601/", "id": 20601, "name": "Killzone 2"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-02-26 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72539/", "id": 72539, "name": "Killzone 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/halo-wars-review/1900-117/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5910/211512-emag_halowarsqa_3_4cc00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-211512\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.63102541630149\" data-width=\"1141\" style=\"width: 1141px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5910/211512-emag_halowarsqa_3_4cc00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-211512\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5910/211512-emag_halowarsqa_3_4cc00.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The more you play, the less you'll wrestle with the controls.</figcaption></figure>In this post-<a data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\" href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" slug=\"halo-3\"> Halo 3</a> world, it's fallen to studios other than <a data-ref-id=\"3010-476\" href=\"/bungie-studios/3010-476/\" slug=\"bungie-studios\"> Bungie</a> to keep the Xbox's most revered franchise afloat. <a data-ref-id=\"3025-22\" href=\"/age-of-empires/3025-22/\" slug=\"age-of-empires\"> Age of Empires</a> maker <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1360\" href=\"/ensemble-studios/3010-1360/\" slug=\"ensemble-studios\"> Ensemble</a> is the first out of the gate with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20521\" href=\"/halo-wars/3030-20521/\" slug=\"halo-wars\"> Halo Wars</a>, a PC-style real-time strategy game set a number of years before the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2600\" href=\"/halo-combat-evolved/3030-2600/\" slug=\"halo-combat-evolved\"> Halo</a>. The game gets a lot of mileage out of the Halo universe and gives a respectable strategy experience, though the limitations of its gamepad-based control scheme can make for some frustrating moments in the thick of battle.<br/><br/> Ensemble wastes no time establishing this game's Halo-ness; all of the menu and front-end interface elements are straight out of Bungie's shooters, the score is likewise reminiscent, and though <a data-ref-id=\"3005-175\" href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" slug=\"master-chief\"> Master Chief</a> himself doesn't make an appearance, you still get to see a few <a data-ref-id=\"3015-666\" href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" slug=\"spartan\"> Spartans</a> tearing it up against <a data-ref-id=\"3015-81\" href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" slug=\"the-covenant\"> the Covenant</a>--not to mention all the Warthogs, Elites, Scorpions, Scarabs, and Wraiths your Halo-loving heart could desire.<br/><br/> In a broad sense, Halo Wars pays a lot of service to fans, even if the game's specific storyline isn't much to write home about. You've got salty old Captain Cutter in command of the UNSC capital ship  <i>Spirit of Fire</i>, Halo Wars' equivalent of the  <i>Pillar of Autumn</i>. There's  Serena, a sardonic British version of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-315\" href=\"/cortana/3005-315/\" slug=\"cortana\"> Cortana</a>; sassy, no-nonsense scientist Anders; and Sergeant Forge, a square-jawed boy scout type who's your man on the ground in most missions. The characters are a little one-dimensional, and their interactions don't make them nearly as likable as the banter you regularly got between Master Chief and Cortana in the previous Halo games.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899129-sc002_s0001.00_1090.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899129\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899129-sc002_s0001.00_1090.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899129\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899129-sc002_s0001.00_1090.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The bland storyline is at least really pretty to look at.</figcaption></figure>The  <i>Spirit of Fire</i> spends most of the game chasing the Covenant around the galaxy, running up against other familiar Halo factions and ultimately getting involved in some events that very nearly changed the course of history in the Halo universe. The dialogue can get a little corny and the general flow of events feels disjointed due to all the abrupt planet-hopping, but it's all presented in lavishly produced CG cutscenes between each mission that are fun to watch, especially when the Spartans really get down to doing what they do.<br/><br/> The story campaign--which takes place only from the human perspective--does a decent job of introducing you to the nuts and bolts of Halo Wars' strategy gameplay and controls. Ensemble made some smart design calls here to simplify traditional RTS aspects that don't translate well to the console. You generate resources transparently in dedicated supply buildings; no worker drones or static gold mines to hassle with. Buildings go into preset slots that spiral from your main base, so you don't have to fiddle with building placement. In terms of the basic rules, the game feels nicely streamlined.<br/><br/> Still, I wish the controls were more fully realized. Halo Wars' unit management gets by on a minimum of controller shortcuts, offering only basic methods of selecting, grouping, and controlling units. You  <i>can</i> select all of your units on the map, or you can select only the ones currently onscreen, and when you've got a group selected, you can cycle through the individual unit types, which at least lets you access their secondary abilities quickly.<br/><br/> But you can't split all units of one type up into subgroups, even though you may not want to move all eight of your Warthogs across the map at once. You also can't set fixed control groups that you can toggle between, once you  <i>do</i> get the right units selected. To be fair, once units are in different parts of the map, you can cycle between de facto groups based on location pretty quickly. But when you've got a big clump of units mashed together in one place, it's a clumsy and time-consuming process to split them up manually.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/875303-halowars2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875303\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/875303-halowars2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875303\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/875303-halowars2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/875303-halowars2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The robust multiplayer is the best part of Halo Wars.</figcaption></figure>Then again, a big clump of units is usually all you need. Can you really fault the game for its lack of control subtlety, when the controls that are here are sufficient to get you through both the campaign missions and the back-and-forth attrition of the multiplayer? No, not really. As tempting as it is to go \"Waaaah, RTS on a console! Mouse and keyboard for life,\" my frustration with Halo Wars' controls typically petered out at the academic level. From time to time I thought it would be cool if I were able to get into higher-level tactics, but I never found a serious need to do so in practice. And at least most of the campaign's 15 missions avoid the old standby \"blow up the enemy's base\" victory condition. There's some kind of unique mechanic going on in almost every mission.<br/><br/> The familiar Halo trappings extend all the way down the game's feature list, including the campaign, mission scoring, and secret goodies. You rack up a score during each of the campaign's levels--based on your completion time, enemies killed, and finished secondary objectives--then you get a bronze/silver/gold medal based on your score. Heroic and Legendary difficulty modes are available, and you can play the whole campaign cooperatively if you want. There are even secret skulls to find in each mission that will provide various positive and negative effects on subsequent plays, just like in the Halo shooters, and you can unlock entries on a lengthy Halo timeline that fill in the broad picture of the series' history. From a top-level perspective, this is certainly a complete Halo package.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/177903-mark_iv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177903\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.89444444444444\" data-width=\"180\" style=\"width: 180px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:89.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/177903-mark_iv.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-177903\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/177903-mark_iv.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/177903-mark_iv.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are worse ways Ensemble could have gone out.</figcaption></figure>And of course, no Halo game would be complete without a robust multiplayer mode. You've got the Halo-style party system here to facilitate matches for up to six people on a healthy variety of maps, and you can mix and match AI players on either side at different difficulties to fill out slots if you want. There are two modes, starting with the regular skirmish that has you starting from scratch, building up a base and teching up the tree to get the best units. The other mode, deathmatch, turns the game into nonstop total warfare. You start with all units and tech fully researched and with a huge amount of capital, so you can launch straight into building war machines instantly. Your population in this mode scales to the number of expansions you control, so the matches here can get huge and intense as you expand your territory. The scale of the battles that resulted from playing a one-on-one match on a map meant for six people was laugh-out-loud funny at times.<br/><br/> Ultimately, I had more fun with the multiplayer than the campaign, perhaps because I'd completed the latter and used it as a kind of extended tutorial before getting into competitive play, and already had a handle on the controls and all the UNSC units. You can also play the Covenant in multiplayer, and there are three unique hero units on each side that give a good variety of additional unique units, attacks, and abilities. The UNSC and Covenant are pretty different to begin with, design-wise, so between your choice of race and then subsequent choice of a leader character, the two modes, and wealth of maps, there's a lot to come back to in the multiplayer here.<br/><br/> It's also worth noting that by the time I'd gotten to the multiplayer, I really wasn't sweating the controls. On the contrary, I surprised myself a few times when I managed to make some units do what I wanted them to do without consciously thinking about the required controller inputs. Call it a steep but surmountable learning curve.<br/><br/> If you haven't heard, Halo Wars marks Ensemble's last project as a development studio. There's no doubting many of its longtime fans (and perhaps some of its employees) would have preferred to see the company go out by doing what it does best with a traditional real-time strategy game on the PC.

The single-player portion of the game plays like an action-heavy, party-based RPG with persistent units who level up and equip loot. The online game, however, takes a more traditional real-time strategy approach with higher unit counts, field upgrades, and some light base-building. Although players might not welcome both sides of this coin, both are polished to such a degree that it's hard to fault Relic for trying to open the game up to two similar but notoriously fractured groups of PC gamers.</div><div><br/></div><div>Although there are four playable races in the game, Dawn of War II's campaign plays entirely from the perspective of a squad of Space Marines known as the Blood Ravens. Your group of persistent heroes jumps between three worlds, trying to fight back an onslaught by the insect-like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2514\" href=\"/tyranids/3015-2514/\" slug=\"tyranids\">Tyranids</a>, while the brutish <a data-ref-id=\"3015-492\" href=\"/orcs-orks/3015-492/\" slug=\"orcs-orks\">Orks</a> loot the battlefield and the technologically advanced <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1272\" href=\"/eldar/3015-1272/\" slug=\"eldar\">Eldar</a> treat everyone like ants and try to obliterate the infestation. Though there are a few epic scripted sequences during your fights, the mostly forgettable story is told between missions before deployment. Your involvement in the Blood Ravens' fate will likely be more influenced by your attachment to the Warhammer 40K source material than this game's specific narrative.</div><div><br/></div><div>Although the main story arc is a structured affair, the game allows you to choose some optional missions in any order, with the caveat that these optional missions themselves are only available for a limited time. Because every mission has some form of loot reward and planetary faction bonus tied to its completion, time can be an important factor, and you'll need to make some choices about what missions you're willing to take on, and when. It's not going to provide a drastically different experience through replay, but the choice is a nice touch that at least lets you avoid portions of the game you might not enjoy.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/181271-0002_assault_jump.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181271\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/380/181271-0002_assault_jump.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-181271\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/380/181271-0002_assault_jump.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Online, you'll find a more traditional RTS game.</figcaption></figure>Aside from some lengthy late-game battles, Dawn of War II's missions are short affairs; you'll likely complete each one within 20 minutes of being dropped onto the map. That brisk pace alone marks a radical departure for the genre, and since you often control only four units at any one time, the campaign feels closer to a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-102\" href=\"/commandos/3025-102/\" slug=\"commandos\">Commandos</a> game than a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20660\" href=\"/command-conquer-red-alert-3/3030-20660/\" slug=\"command-conquer-red-alert-3\">Command &amp; Conquer</a> one. Almost every mission features a fun boss fight of some kind, even though the encounters eventually become a bit predictable.</div><div><br/></div><div>During missions, your units will earn experience, level up, and find loot that they can equip between battles. Your unique play style will be influenced by a number of factors, such as choosing which four units to deploy, and whether to focus those individual units' development on energy and ranged attacks versus more stamina- and strength-based abilities. On the whole, this system breeds a greater level of attachment to your units than you'd ever feel for the nameless dudes churned out of the nearest factory in other strategy games.</div><div><br/></div><div>The fighting itself in both the campaign and the online experience will be instantly familiar to those who played through Relic's last game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18930\" href=\"/company-of-heroes/3030-18930/\" slug=\"company-of-heroes\">Company of Heroes</a>. Like that game, the heavy emphasis here is on suppression, cover, and destructible environments, and you won't build a single base over the course of the entire single-player game. The campaign is pretty easy even on the harder difficulty level, mostly due to the low unit count and small-scale battles.</div><div><br/></div><div>The skirmish and multiplayer components of the game play much differently from the campaign, and feel fairly standard for a strategy title.\u00a0When playing online, you'll start with a pre-built base and have to capture control points and power nodes to requisition new troops.\u00a0For some this is going to be a jarring experience, as you'll have to learn new skills and menu elements that don't exist in the single-player game. For those familiar with more typical RTS games this won't cause a problem, but if you're coming to the Dawn of War II with more action-RPG-oriented tastes, you may find yourself in a strange new world after you complete the campaign.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/874454-4tn4vh3k.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874454\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1440\" style=\"width: 1440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/874454-4tn4vh3k.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874454\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/874454-4tn4vh3k.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/874454-4tn4vh3k.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's something here for all strategy fans.</figcaption></figure>Along with choosing one of the four races in multiplayer matches, you'll also get to choose one of that race's three hero commanders. Each race features a balanced but unique play style. In truth your commander choice seems to most impact your overall strategy, as it defines whether you are playing an offensive, defensive, or support game. With 3v3 and 2v2 matches available in either annihilation or control-point victory mode (think <a data-ref-id=\"3025-51\" href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" slug=\"battlefield\">Battlefield</a>), it's important to mix and match your commanders between teams. Focusing too heavily on any one discipline can often spell disaster.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game requires both Steam and Games For Windows Live and includes achievement points for Live. The integration with both systems works well for the most part, though along with some other users on our forums I didn't receive achievement points for completing the game, which is a minor blemish in an otherwise nearly spotless execution. Dawn of War II also features a co-op mode for the campaign, which makes the game ridiculously easy, though it's a nice addition for those who like playing with their buds.</div><div><br/></div><div>Overall, the only major problem with recommending Dawn of War II is its minor identity crisis. If you normally don't like RTS games but are a fan of light role-playing that focuses more on the combat than the story, you'll likely find much to love in this game's campaign, and that should be enough to satisfy. However, if you're a fan of traditional strategy games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20674\" href=\"/starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty/3030-20674/\" slug=\"starcraft-ii-wings-of-liberty\">StarCraft</a> or even the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2115\" href=\"/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/3030-2115/\" slug=\"warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war\">Dawn of War</a>, you might be underwhelmed by the simplified gameplay of the sequel's campaign, and may want to jump straight to the deeper online experience. Both halves are well done, though there's no guarantee you'll like both of them equally. \u00a0Whichever choice you make, Relic has done a commendable job trying to kill two birds with one stone. You might just wish they had focused more on the portion of the game you enjoy most.</div></div>", "deck": "Dawn of War II successfully introduces RPG elements to its single-player campaign and provides a polished, if familiar, online experience that focuses on brisk combat.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-118/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21175/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/3030-21175/", "id": 21175, "name": "Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-03-04 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-79720/", "id": 79720, "name": "Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War II"}, "reviewer": "Dave"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tom-clancys-hawx-review/1900-119/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/908521-31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908521\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/908521-31.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-908521\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/908521-31.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Cockpit view is available, if that's your thing.</figcaption></figure>Tom Clancy's HAWX takes Ubisoft's brand of near-future espionage into the wild blue yonder as you take on the role of a fighter pilot and fly combat missions in a decidedly <a data-ref-id=\"3025-16\" href=\"/ace-combat/3025-16/\" slug=\"ace-combat\">Ace Combat</a>-like fashion. There are some cool ideas in HAWX that can make the art of flying quite a bit easier for novice players, and an \"assistance OFF\" toggle that lets you flip and stall your plane with a camera angle designed to make dogfights more dynamic. The bulk of the game, though, is focused on you putting your targeting reticle onto a yellow box until the yellow box turns red. Then you push the fire button once or twice and move on to the next target. Add in an unhealthy obsession with defensive or escort objectives and you've got a game with a solid core that doesn't focus enough on its strengths to leave you feeling fully satisfied.</div><div><br/></div><div>It also made a pretty awful first impression with me, at least on the 360. There's some sort of bug in the game that can cause it to crash at the title screen. I booted the game up five times and it crashed three of those five times, both when running off the disc and when installed to the hard drive. After asking around online, I was able to at least determine that I wasn't alone, but it doesn't seem to be happening to everyone. Some people claim that performing maintenance on the 360 hard drive (which is done via an undocumented code on the dashboard) clears it up. I didn't spend tons of time trying to troubleshoot the issue, and instead decided to just play and finish it in a couple of sittings on the occasions that I got it to boot up. Regardless, it's a pretty embarrassing issue for a shipping product to have.</div><div><br/></div><div>Once I got past that, I dove into the campaign. It opens with you flying for the United States as a part of the HAWX squadron. For the record, that stands for \"High Altitude Warfare eXperimental squadron,\" which is a pretty busted acronym. After a few missions with Uncle Sam, your squadron is disbanded and you sign up with Artemis, a private military company that takes on contracts and flies missions for the highest bidder. Because this is the same Tom Clancy universe that is constantly putting the USA in dangerous situations and portraying attacks on domestic soil, you can see the plot points unfolding about a mission or two before they actually happen. It all feels a little hokey, and unlike the other Clancy games, watching the intrigue play out in pre-mission briefings or from the relatively anonymous comfort of a fighter jet makes you feel completely detached from the goings-on. Yeah, you might be averting nuclear situations or covering a Ghost Recon squad, but it's all just yellow boxes and red boxes when you're in the cockpit.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/914813-hawx_dx102009_03_0312_53_47_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-914813\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/914813-hawx_dx102009_03_0312_53_47_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-914813\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/914813-hawx_dx102009_03_0312_53_47_13.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The ground looks decent when you get up close.</figcaption></figure>The base level of action in HAWX is on-par with what you'd expect out of a modern flight combat game. You turn, you burn, and you blast targets using one of the hundreds of missiles you're issued. You'll also bomb ground targets in some cases, and the bombing interface is easy to get the hang of thanks to an incredibly friendly HUD. HAWX seems designed for people who don't want to learn about Immelmann turns, Split Ss, or other air combat maneuvers. At any point, you can hit a button to bring up a handy on-screen guide that, depending on your current situation, guides you to your next target, gets you in behind a targeted enemy jet, or guides you through evasive tactics designed to dodge incoming missiles. It's useful to the point of making the game a little too easy in spots. Either way, the on-screen indicator gates look pretty cool while they're at it.</div><div><br/></div><div>The other part of HAWX that breaks rank with the typical air combat game is called OFF, or Assistance OFF mode. This mode turns off the safety protocols that keep your plane from stalling out, and with them disengaged, you can execute wicked drift turns that let you quickly change direction, making it useful for swinging around to get a missile lock on an enemy at your rear. If you brake too hard and turn too much, your plane will stall and start falling, but it's really easy to get it going again. The camera also pulls out to a dynamic, distance third-person view of your plane. This can make it sort of tough to line up shots on your opponents, but it also gives you a clear view of just how crazy your plane looks as it flips and whips around in the sky. It's just sort of a shame that there aren't many situations in the campaign that really demand this sort of technique. Overall, the control in HAWX is just fine. The game lets you employ some one-word voice commands to perform many basic tasks, but pressing a button beats saying \"SHOOT\" into your headset every time.</div><div><br/></div><div>The campaign can also be played cooperatively by up to four players online, which makes things even easier. You can certainly raise the difficulty setting, but this just appears to play around with how much ammo you start a mission with and how much damage you can take, rather than making the enemy pilots more intense. There's also a versus mode that lets two teams of up to four players battle it out in a team dogfight. When you earn kills, you earn points that can be used to call in temporary support powers, like drones that can heal your team's planes, EMP pulses that cause the enemy to stall, jammers that prevent enemy missiles from locking on, and so on. If you're into dogfighting, it all works pretty well. But since that's the only mode available, all of those bombers and air-to-ground missile packages you keep unlocking in the single-player mode are totally worthless. The match filters have room for multiple game types, but the only available option is \"Team Deathmatch,\" leaving the impression that they're going to try to get you to pay for more multiplayer modes down the line.</div><div><br/></div><div>HAWX is pretty easy on the eyes, with good-looking plane models, solid in-air explosions when your missiles hit their mark, and decent-looking ground, though some of the textures you'll see when flying low are a little low-res. The HUD elements are numerous, but easy-to-understand. You'll occasionally get some polygonal dudes showing up in picture-in-picture windows to advance the story mid-mission. They look sort of bad if you stare at them, but considering you'll usually be focused on a sky full of yellow targeting boxes, they don't stand out too much.</div><div><br/></div><div>HAWX is a little too short and a little too easy to recommend wholeheartedly, though if the thought of embarking on a cooperative jet-fighting mission or participating in high-powered dogfights is enough to get your pulse racing, you'll probably find enough going on to keep you occupied.</div>", "deck": "Tom Clancy's HAWX changes up the flight combat formula in a couple of interesting ways, but at its core it's a little too basic to hold your attention.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-119/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20671/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tom-clancys-hawx/3030-20671/", "id": 20671, "name": "Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-03-09 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73450/", "id": 73450, "name": "Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X."}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/empire-total-war-review/1900-120/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3817/451516-20080410_135211_1_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-451516\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.742\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3817/451516-20080410_135211_1_med.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-451516\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3817/451516-20080410_135211_1_med.jpg\"></a><figcaption>No empire is complete without some sweet boats.</figcaption></figure>Let's just get this out of the way first. Trading swords for muskets, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-211\" href=\"/the-creative-assembly/3010-211/\" slug=\"the-creative-assembly\">The Creative Assembly</a>'s newest strategy title <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20509\" href=\"/empire-total-war/3030-20509/\" slug=\"empire-total-war\">Empire: Total War</a> is saddled with some significant bugs that will likely frustrate both old and new players to the series. That it's one of the grandest and most ambitious strategy games to come along over the last decade or so only heightens that frustration. The shipping version of the game has numerous AI glitches that will strike down more of your army than smallpox did during the historical reality.\u00a0Artillery left without close supervision will shoot through your own buildings to attack moving enemies, minutemen will refuse to line up on the correct side of cover, and the poor pathfinding near forts and fences means that you will likely place your defending army outside their protective walls just to avoid the hassle. These issues and many more don't pop up in every battle, but in a game so tied to the positioning and formation of your units, the issues are absolutely heartbreaking when they surface.</div><div><br/></div><div>All this is heartbreaking because the rest of Empire: Total War is so amazing.

As one part <a data-ref-id=\"3015-214\" href=\"/4x/3015-214/\" slug=\"4x\">4X</a>\u00a0turn-based strategy and one part real-time battle manager, Empire puts you in command one of ten nations as you fight, collude, and outbuild your enemies in hopes of constructing the world's largest empire. The game takes place during the 18th century, which turns out to be the perfect\u00a0backdrop for the action, representing a time when the world began to fully realize the riches and rewards of global colonization. This is simply a huge game that has not only armies to manage but diplomacy, technology, taxes, religion, trade routes, and even individual scholars and agents that move along the game's well-built world map. Want to assassinate a known philosopher next turn? Go for it. The turn after that, you can ally with a small American-Indian nation and recruit their warriors into your own army.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game's many layers would be daunting if it weren't for Empire's Road to Independence, which is an introductory campaign that slowly eases you into management of your empire as you play the soon-to-be United States over four structured episodes. The first, based on the founding of Jamestown by British colonials, will have you learning your way around a battlefield and your city management menus as you fight back the local indigenous residents of Virginia. In the second you'll be making alliances and fighting off the French on both land and sea in a larger setting during the French and Indian War. Episode III has you declaring independence, founding the United States, and fighting your way way from Boston as you reclaim the continent. The last episode is essentially just a version of the game's Grand Campaign mode where you assert the United States as a world power. Although most veteran Total War players might look past this stuff, it's extremely well done both as a light history lesson and as a tutorial. It's also the only way to actually open up the United States as a playable nation in the Grand Campaign.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/139/922079-housebrawl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-922079\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/139/922079-housebrawl.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-922079\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/139/922079-housebrawl.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's a shame that the pathfinding isn't better, because it's one of the game's few flaws.</figcaption></figure>The Grand Campaign is where the bulk of the game resides. After selecting one of the ten available nations you'll be assigned specific win conditions that must be achieved by the year 1800. Play as the British and you'll need to make sure a portion of your empire resides in India. Fight as the Prussians and you will start with a divided country and must overtake Poland and the rest of eastern Europe to win the game. Despite only having one map--the known world--it's a surprisingly varied experience depending on whom you pick. There is also the ability to win through prestige rather than by amassing land, but I found it ridiculously hard to avoid being a virtual conquistador in my actions.</div><div><br/></div><div>The cloud-laden world map is a lively centerpiece that takes most of the tedium out of the Civilization-style blueprint and focuses instead on the movements and machinations of your scholars, troops, and warships. Setting up a trade route involves nothing more then making the right bribe to the right country. In turn, attacking an enemy's trade routes and ports rewards you with some much-needed currency to fund your campaign. If your trade route crosses the open sea, you'll not only have to worry about warring nations, but pirates who seem to plague certain high trafficked areas of the map like the Caribbean. The UI keeps things simple and once you've decided upon a course of action you'll very rarely have to revisit it. The only negative against the world map is that like similar games in the genre, you'll be spending a lot of time waiting between turns as your enemy moves across the map. While you can turn off viewing the enemy movements, you're still looking at a few minutes of downtime.</div><div><br/></div><div>Battles take place whenever you move your army or navy against an opposing force or city. Unless you've sent agents in ahead of time, you might not know what you're up against, so it's best to build up before you head in. Once you're engaged, the game changes to a real-time battlefield where you command your troops over rolling hills, farms, and even famous period-specific forts. The inclusion of muskets and gunpowder to the series makes the actual fighting even more strategic than its predecessors. Gone are the days when you could easily turn the tide with a single squad of cavalry. Charging against a well-entrenched line of militia will make you quickly revise the strategies you used in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19641\" href=\"/medieval-total-war/3030-19641/\" slug=\"medieval-total-war\">Medieval</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19887\" href=\"/rome-total-war/3030-19887/\" slug=\"rome-total-war\">Rome</a>. You can also quarter your troops in buildings and farmhouses around a city for extra cover. Doing so seems to be the favorite early battle strategy of the enemy AI, who will sit inside a building even though your cannons, placed a hundred yards away, will rain shot with relative ease until the building is destroyed with a satisfying explosion.</div><div><br/></div><div>Though they look amazing, the battlefields are where Empire seems a tad rushed. A large portion of both the multiplayer and single-player components of Empire involve you either attacking or defending forts. Unfortunately, the line of sight and pathfinding algorithms in and around forts seems completely busted at the moment. Units placed near mounted canons will not man them, units on top of fort walls will often not fire at units below, and moving a squad of riflemen from one side of a fort to the other is an exercise in futility. Outside of forts, you'll run into fence lines that sometimes cause problems for your cavalry, and phantom hills that will cause your rushing army to run in place.</div><div><br/></div><div>Your cannon placement is also limited by the AI's inability to judge when it should stop firing. On one fort defense battle I had cannons placed in front of my fort's walls in hopes they could rain down on my approaching enemy before they got to the gates. While I was fighting on my flank, I noticed my cannons, which I had left in free-fire mode, had decided to continue firing at the enemy through my own walls, making a giant point of entry and leaving me laughing at the screen. Musketmen have similar problems deciding when to stop shooting, even if your own units cross in front of them. While the friendly fire casualties are a welcome dose of realism (though not new to this series), the previous Total War games had less chance of it since most of your projectiles--mostly arrows--had a deeper arc. This wouldn't be as serious an issue if your units' movements were a little more dependable.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/915522-empire2009_03_0418_05_55_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915522\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/915522-empire2009_03_0418_05_55_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915522\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/915522-empire2009_03_0418_05_55_04.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/915522-empire2009_03_0418_05_55_04.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Different factions will have different conditions for victory.</figcaption></figure>Empire: Total War introduces naval battles that are gorgeous if simplistic recreations of mast-and-powder warfare. The same point-to-go battle interface found in the land battles exists here, though your ships won't get caught up on the barricades, forts, and other obstructions your land troops have to deal with. You can (and should) manually control your ships' aiming, to make sure you get a full barrage at your enemy. Ships can also be told how many sails to have up, which you'll want to be aware of when you come into contact with the enemy, since captains have the choice to assign chained and grape shot to specifically wreck your mast and crew. Take them down enough and you might get a chance to board the enemy's ship; if successful, you'll make that ship a part of your navy. Although Empire's naval battles work best when there's a small amount of ships in a battle, the battles themselves are tense, exciting experiences that fans of novels like the <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Complete-Aubrey-Maturin-Novels/dp/039306011X/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1236807396&amp;sr=8-2\" rel=\"nofollow\">Aubrey/Maturin</a> series will appreciate.</div><div><br/></div><div>Empire's multiplayer is currently limited to single-battle skirmishes through the game's internal matchmaker. The only problem I really had with multiplayer centers around the host in a quick match having the option to determine your starting position. You'll notice a lot of unscrupulous players will task you with defending a fort, and since neither player usually wants anything to do with fighting around a fort, this can often leave you at a disadvantage against a larger attacking force outside your walls. Otherwise, multiplayer is a blast, mostly because you're forced to\u00a0implement\u00a0all your\u00a0strategies\u00a0in real time. (The camapign allows you to pause combat to issue orders.) I should note that Creative Assembly recently announced a version of the campaign mode will be available in multiplayer soon through a patch. How much fun it will be waiting for your enemy to make his turn is unknown, though my guess is they'll allow you to play in this mode over the course of several days.</div><div><br/></div><div>In the end, Empire's only blemish is its unresponsive units and pathing. For a game whose greatest thrills result from the specific gambles you make with your troop movements, it's a shame you're sometimes punished when that movement seems out of your control. Even with its flaws, though, the newest Total War is so breathtaking and immersive that it's hard not to recommend to avid strategy fans. Games this deep seem to be a dying breed, and though it's not something I'd feel comfortable recommending to more casual players, patient fans of the genre should know the sheer scope and complexity of the game currently has no equal and is worth weathering the hiccups. Cautious buyers, however, might want to wait a few weeks and see if these issues are resolved in a patch, something that, as of this writing, the team at Creative Assembly seems eager to provide.</div><div><br/></div>", "deck": "If you can get past some glaring pathfinding and AI issues, Empire: Total War is a game without peer in the strategy genre.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-120/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20509/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/empire-total-war/3030-20509/", "id": 20509, "name": "Empire: Total War"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-03-11 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-81043/", "id": 81043, "name": "Empire: Total War"}, "reviewer": "Dave"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/eat-lead-the-return-of-matt-hazard-review/1900-121/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/778468-matthazard12.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-778468\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/778468-matthazard12.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-778468\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11423/778468-matthazard12.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>Oh yeah, there are also zombies.</figcaption></figure>Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard is a dull, repetitive third-person shooter that attempts to get by on its sense of humor.

But... it's a video game! So... uh... <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">what</span>? I was totally unable to handle the logic leaps required to make the story work. At one point, the game pulls out to the \"real world\" to show you the evil CEO plotting Hazard's demise. But it's rendered in the same graphics engine used for the game. Maybe if the developer had gone all the way and shot a little video of actual humans for these bits, it would have gone down a bit more smoothly.</div><div><br/></div><div>The story manifests itself in a way that makes the game seem like some sort of hyper installment of <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">The Matrix</span>. The game is constantly glitching as programmers insert more enemies and objects into the scene to take you down. And all of those enemies come from Matt's previous works, which means you'll fight a range of generic enemies, like cowboys, evil Russians, space marines, and cybernetic-looking troopers armed with water guns (from Matt's ill-advised kid-friendly water shooter). You'll even fight flat, 2D Nazis in an homage to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7694\" href=\"/wolfenstein-3d/3030-7694/\" slug=\"wolfenstein-3d\">Wolfenstein 3D</a>, and they'll turn sideways to avoid incoming fire. It's kind of funny to see cowboys and Russians working together (for a change), especially when they're materializing in some kind of dance club filled with holographic dancing girls, but the enemy variety ends up being pretty weak. You see most of what the game has to offer in the first few levels, and from there it just becomes simple repetition with an occasional boss fight.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18329/714982-matt_hazard_3d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-714982\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5077160493827\" data-width=\"648\" style=\"width: 648px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18329/714982-matt_hazard_3d.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-714982\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/18329/714982-matt_hazard_3d.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The fake game boxes used to promote Matt Hazard are kind of funnier than the game itself.</figcaption></figure>The game is a cover-based third-person shooter, with cover that will \"de-rez\" if it takes too many hits. Headshots are the order of the day, making the pistols key pieces of weaponry if you're a steady shot. You'll also find some fully-automatic weapons, a shotgun, a grenade launcher, a sniper rifle, some plasma weaponry, and some water guns, which are useful because they take out the water-gun enemies much faster than regular weapons. The actual shooting feels flat and the weapons really lack punch. You also have a melee attack. Other than shooting, hitting, and taking cover, there really isn't anything else, mechanically, to see. Hazard moves sort of slowly, so a dive or a run command might have been nice.</div><div><br/></div><div>Along the way you'll receive assistance from a holographic lady (who exists in the \"real world\" in some form) known as QA. I kept hoping that the game would have you stop receiving assistance about a third of way through and claim that the entire QA department had been laid off. But the game's sense of humor doesn't really get too inside, beyond a quick crack about producers not actually playing games. Instead, it's usually really simple stuff, like an encounter with a guy named Master Chef, or a Mario gag. Most of the references are solid, but they aren't especially funny, either. Unless you think seeing a space marine in an armored chef's outfit is a scream. For me, the funniest part of the entire game is a boss fight against a parody of a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13053\" href=\"/final-fantasy-vii/3030-13053/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-vii\">Final Fantasy</a> protagonist. From the pre-fight dialogue to the way his actions are selected off of a menu during the fight, it's a good bit of business that follows through on the concept's potential. There's also a good bit about an extra-long elevator ride.</div><div><br/></div><div>So it's not <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">entirely</span> devoid of quality humor, but it's hard to call Matt Hazard a funny game. Will Arnett just sort of drones on in the lead role, which seems like a bit of a waste. That could have been anyone. The different AI enemies call out a lot, too, though I couldn't tell if having them call out that they were out of ammo was supposed to be deliberately bad or just, well, bad. Either way, a lot of the non-story dialogue gets repeated frequently.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's a little weird to think of it this way, since the intents are so vastly different, but as far as recently released third-person shooters go, I think <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20454\" href=\"/50-cent-blood-on-the-sand/3030-20454/\" slug=\"50-cent-blood-on-the-sand\">50 Cent: Blood on the Sand</a> is a far funnier game than Eat Lead: The Return of Matt Hazard. But that's just it. Humor is entirely subjective, and maybe some of the stuff I found to be a little easy and dull will get you going. However, I'm a lot more certain about the quality of Matt Hazard's gameplay, which almost feels like it's going out of its way to be mediocre at best.

It has clear, concise goals. It gives you constant feedback as you progress towards those goals. Finally, it gives you more positive reinforcement than your creepy high school guidance counselor. I mean, seriously, this game throws up rainbows and bursts into chorus every time you complete a level. Now <i>that </i>is love.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9065/497870-peggle8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-497870\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.74976569821931\" data-width=\"1067\" style=\"width: 1067px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9065/497870-peggle8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-497870\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9065/497870-peggle8.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You did a great job, here's a rainbow!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In practice, though, Peggle is a game that is probably best utilized as a distraction. It's the game you play between playing other games, or doing the laundry, or washing the dishes. Essentially, it is the tool of the devil, and significant others should be wary of even letting it into the house. It's too easy to find yourself dropping time on Peggle, but it's actually difficult to find yourself dropping <i>a lot </i>of time on it. This is because the genius of Peggle is that it never really changes, but it's also different every time you play it.</p><p style=\"\">The gameplay mechanics are simple. At the top of the screen is a little cannon, which you use to aim, and then propel, a little ball downwards. If you fall through the bottom of the screen your ball will be lost, but if you happen to land in the little bucket that will endlessly pace back and forth along the bottom edge, your ball will be returned to you. Now, between your canon and this bucket, the screen is filled with colored pegs, which act as little bumpers for your ball. Essentially, your goal is to eliminate all of the orange-colored pegs on any given screen, without losing all ten of your balls. Yes, it's totally a dolled-up version of Pachinko, or for the daytime TV crowd out there, it's Plinko on very cute steroids.</p><p style=\"\">It's a simple concept that plays on our ability to perceive a sense of control where there is none. Sure, you can aim your initial shot, but after about the first or second bounce, you are at the mercy of the game's physics. This magic formula, the fine mix of perceived control and chaos is why we have a very profitable Las Vegas. You'll obtain various power-ups to help put a little more control back in your hands, but at the end of the day, it's all about how a little ball is going to bounce off a little peg. That being said, Peggle won't be taking your kid's college fund while you progress through its different modes and challenges.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The main focus of the single-player is the Adventure mode. Here, you'll be introduced to Peggle's cast of characters, each of whom bestows a different magical power for use on his or her level. You'll unlock the power by hitting one of the few green pegs strewn throughout the board. So, for example, while you're playing through Bjorn-the-male-unicorn's level, you'll be able to use the Super Guide power, which shows you where your ball will bounce after its initial impact. When you're going through Splork's levels, you'll be able to use the amazing Space Blast. This power is probably my personal favorite, as it indiscriminately destroys a given number of pegs on the board. There are considerable differences in how the powers behave, so not only will they add some variety during the Adventure mode, but later in the game you'll be able to pick your favorite power to use on any map, giving you a chance to vary your strategy.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/927325-peggle_persona_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-927325\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56333333333333\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/927325-peggle_persona_super.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-927325\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/927325-peggle_persona_super.png\"></a><figcaption>Another happy Peggle customer. *</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once you make it through the Adventure portion of the game, you'll unlock Challenge mode. This lets you play the Peggle maps with some additional requirements. These range from the inclusion of more orange pegs, to having to clear the entire board of all the pegs. These challenges add a lot more gameplay to the bundle, but I feel they could have been a little bit more creative in the requirements for each stage.</p><p style=\"\">There's also some multiplayer Peggle to be had. You can play online, in a ranked or unranked match, or you can play locally. There's not much variety either way, as you'll be trading turns with your opponent as you both try to get the most points by hitting those orange pegs. Again, it's not the most creative scenario in the world, but it gives you a chance to showcase your Peggle skills, and become the number one ranked Peggle player on Xbox Live!</p><p style=\"\">Peggle is a great game, and it's one that can easily fill those hours you've set aside to actually be productive. Other versions of Peggle have been available for years on the PC and Mac--platforms which, in all honesty, are probably better suited to the game's short play sessions--but the Xbox Live Arcade version is no slouch. It would have been nice to stretch the brain-box a bit with crazier modes or challenges, and the inclusion of a level editor certainly wouldn't have hurt, but at 10 dollars, Peggle is a welcome addition to my procrastination repertoire.</p><p style=\"\">*<i>Not depicted: <a href=\"/peggle-deluxe/3030-21963/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-21963\">Peggle</a></i></p>", "deck": "The XBLA version of Peggle is a great way to not do what you were supposed to be doing.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-122/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21963/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/peggle/3030-21963/", "id": 21963, "name": "Peggle"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-03-12 11:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-81877/", "id": 81877, "name": "Peggle"}, "reviewer": "Vinny"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/resident-evil-5-review/1900-123/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/859816-re515.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-859816\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"512\" style=\"width: 512px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/859816-re515.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-859816\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/859816-re515.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yep, definitely a Resident Evil game.</figcaption></figure>A little over four years ago, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a> served a healthy dose of crow to a legion of naysayers with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\" href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" slug=\"resident-evil-4\">Resident Evil 4</a>, a game that completely revitalized the revered but flagging survival horror franchise, and also happened to practically rewrite the rules of the third-person shooter genre. I'll admit upfront I consider Resident Evil 4 one of the best games ever made, and I don't think subsequent hits like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War</a> would exist--at least not in their current form--without the innovations Capcom brought to the table in early 2005.</div><div><br/></div><div>Now we have <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\" href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/\" slug=\"resident-evil-5\">Resident Evil 5</a>, arriving with the enormous legacy and expectations that followed in the wake of its predecessor. Can the new game reach the same staggering heights as the old? Has lightning struck twice for Capcom? No. But then, is it reasonable to expect such a defining experience with every new iteration of this series? No, not really. In 2005, shooters needed redefining. These days, I think most people are comfortable with the genre's current standards. Resident Evil 5 may play it safe within the formula Capcom established the last time around, but it's still a tense, fantastic action experience that tidily wraps up the decade-old Resident Evil plot arc with some of the most impressive visuals and production values I've ever seen in a game.</div><div><br/></div><div>Then again, if you weren't a big fan of RE4's specific style of shooting--its relatively limited movement controls, laser-sight targeting, constrictive inventory management, and so on--you won't find much in the new game to change your mind, since the basic feel of the shooting is the same here. There are at least few minor improvements. You now have the option to strafe while walking and control the camera movement with the right stick. The game moves the aiming and shooting control to the triggers by default, making it feel more like a modern shooter. You can even take cover on some predefined flat surfaces, and luckily you only really need cover in the spots where the designers allow you to use it.</div><div><br/></div><div>But otherwise, RE5 doesn't quite get with the times, as it ignores some of the changes Gears and other games have made to third-person action in the last four years. It plays almost identically to RE4; you still can't shoot while moving, nor strafe while running. But you don't <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">need</span> to do those things. The game's basic zombie-style enemies and even uglier monsters are slower to move and attack than the quicker, better-armed enemies of more hardcore shooters, so I never felt like I was fighting the controls to get my dirty business done. RE5 strikes a clean balance between modern third-person shooting and the slower-paced survival horror of the older games in the series.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/921694-re527.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921694\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/921694-re527.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921694\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/921694-re527.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Plenty of moody, atmospheric environments to fight through.</figcaption></figure>The game's story reaches all the way back to Resident Evil's beginning. You're back in the role of the series' original square-jawed hero, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-413\" href=\"/chris-redfield/3005-413/\" slug=\"chris-redfield\">Chris Redfield</a>. Following the dissolution of the nefarious <a data-ref-id=\"3015-204\" href=\"/umbrella-corporation/3015-204/\" slug=\"umbrella-corporation\">Umbrella Corporation</a>, bio-organic weapons (read: nasty monsters) have fallen into the hands of the highest bidders with the worst intentions, and Chris is now part of a global clean-up crew called the B.S.A.A. that deals with bio-terrorist outbreaks around the world. At the outset, he travels to Africa to meet up with his new partner, indigenous hottie <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1085\" href=\"/sheva-alomar/3005-1085/\" slug=\"sheva-alomar\">Sheva Alomar</a>, and investigate a rumored weapons deal. Of course, the mission quickly goes awry, leading the pair through more dangerous locations and more sinister events, and ultimately exposing some of the series' darker secrets in the process.</div><div><br/></div><div>RE5's plot initially feels like backpedaling on Capcom's part, because RE4 made such a point of dispensing with the series' backstory. It relegated old figures like Umbrella and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-627\" href=\"/albert-wesker/3005-627/\" slug=\"albert-wesker\">Wesker</a> to history and instead focused on new villains, the cultish <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1745\" href=\"/los-illuminados/3015-1745/\" slug=\"los-illuminados\">Los Illuminados</a> and the parasitic <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1765\" href=\"/las-plagas/3015-1765/\" slug=\"las-plagas\">Las Plagas</a> infection that created the game's quicker, smarter enemies. The parasites are still around, but they're more relevant to the gameplay than the story, which quickly gets back to basics, with Umbrella, Wesker, and other elements of Resident Evil lore again front and center. The game does such a good job of wrapping up the whole saga by its end, though, that I can't fault Capcom for falling back on familiar territory. Whatever direction the next Resident Evil takes, it seems a safe bet that the Umbrella-influenced part of the series is behind us.</div><div><br/></div><div>I really can't say enough about how good Resident Evil 5 looks or how creepy it sounds, but then, I also feel like a picture--or in this case, a video--is worth well more than a thousand words, so you'd be better served by simply watching the game on the Internet to see what it looks like. I will say the environments are extremely varied and immaculately crafted from start to finish, with a really impressive amount of care having been given to the lighting, smoke and particle effects, and other ambient elements that bring each area to life. The creature design is at least as disgusting and disturbing as it was in 4, if not more so. And I have to call special attention to the real-time cutscenes here, which are among the most impressive I've ever seen, easily equaling and perhaps surpassing even the brilliant scenes in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20669\" href=\"/metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots/3030-20669/\" slug=\"metal-gear-solid-4-guns-of-the-patriots\">Metal Gear Solid 4</a>. The use of motion capture, facial animation, eye movements, and other subtle touches makes the human characters shockingly believable, and there's some really impressive fight choreography and intricate action sequences that make them exciting to watch. And while we're talking about graphics, it's worth noting that the frame rate on the PlayStation 3 is noticeably lower than on the Xbox 360 in a number of spots. It's certainly still playable on the PS3, but the difference is significant enough that I'd recommend the Xbox game if you have the option.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917924-mercenaries_007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-917924\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/917924-mercenaries_007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-917924\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/917924-mercenaries_007.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/917924-mercenaries_007.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Extras like the Mercenaries mode will keep you coming back.</figcaption></figure>Sheva's presence in the game allows for\u00a0cooperative play,\u00a0the biggest change to the core gameplay. Even when you're playing alone, she's with you from start to finish, joining in the fight. And as AI partners go, she's really not half bad, most of the time. She'll effectively use the weapons you give her or let her pick up; she killed quite a few enemies for me during my playthrough. She also doubles your inventory space, since you can trade items between both characters. There were a couple of times she got herself randomly killed, which was a big buzzkill, but the game is generous enough with checkpoints that you don't lose too much progress when you die. While I missed the lonely, solitary feel of Resident Evil 4 from time to time, Sheva is a good enough ally to secure a spot on your own personal zombie team.</div><div><br/></div><div>Of course, she's an awful lot better when she's controlled by another human in cooperative play that works online, with system link, or even in split-screen (though the latter doesn't utilize the entire screen and looks pretty bad). There are a few places that only Sheva can reach in the story mode, and when you play as her in a co-op game, you can explore them. Otherwise, the co-op is mainly good for tag-teaming a bunch of zombies, so I think it will best serve you on harder difficulties. The game is challenging but not impossible by yourself on the normal mode, so that mode may get a bit easy for two experienced players.</div><div><br/></div><div>The inventory has also been updated from the spatial, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1896\" href=\"/tetris/3030-1896/\" slug=\"tetris\">Tetris</a>-like system in RE4. There, each item had specific dimensions, and you had to move and rotate them around to make them all fit into your allotted space. In the new game, each character has a simple nine-slot inventory system, with each item or type of ammunition taking up one slot. I definitely found myself having to pass up a lot of dropped ammo due to a lack of open slots, but I also never ran out of ammo for the weapons I was using, so it wasn't a big problem. More pressingly, you now have to manage your inventory in real time as the action keeps happening around you. So you're strongly advised to get all the necessary items traded between Chris and Sheva when there's a lull in the action before moving on--because trying to get her to give you a grenade while she's being eaten alive by a giant zombie dog is a dicey prospect at best.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/921666-re501.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921666\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/921666-re501.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921666\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/921666-re501.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/921666-re501.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The quality of the cutscenes is literally second to none.</figcaption></figure>You can finish the story mode here in about a dozen hours, though every minute is filled with an entertaining mix of combat and light puzzle-solving. The game sends you through dusty towns, wetlands replete with tribal villages, underground ruins, and the requisite secret research facilities, throwing more dangerous zombies and nastier creatures at you every step of the way. There are some really enormous, epic boss encounters here too, many with unique items or mechanics involved that require you to do more than simply pump a bunch of shotgun shells into the boss.\u00a0It's also worth noting that the weapons upgrade system hasn't gone anywhere, though Resident Evil 4's merchant sadly has. No more mysterious, creepy \"What're ya sellin'?\" guy at every turn, which is honestly the most disappointing aspect of the entire game for me. Regardless, you can still buy weapons and tweak out their damage, capacity, reload speed, and other attributes from a menu between chapters and every time you die. It's a good way to add variety to the combat, like it was last time.</div><div><br/></div><div>Like RE4, this game has a lot to come back to after you finish the story. You can replay any chapter from a menu to earn more money and upgrade your weapons beyond what you could achieve on your first run, and you can also earn points you can cash in for items on a gigantic list of peripheral goodies. These include new costumes and \"figurines\" of every character in the game that you can rotate and view up close. The Mercenaries mode also makes a return, giving you 10 unlockable characters to throw against a series of time attack challenges where you try to kill zombies in quick succession to score combo points before time runs out. Mercenaries is now available in split-screen play, too. There are emblems to find hidden in each level that unlock even more goodies. You can unlock infinite-ammo and special versions of most weapons. The list goes on.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>There's really no way Resident Evil 5 could have lived up to the momentous impact made by the last proper Resident Evil game, but I don't think it needed to. That game paved the way for a lot of other great games, one of which is this direct sequel. I played it start to finish in three sittings, have played it extensively in other capacities while working on this review, and still can't wait to go back and play through it again cooperatively on higher difficulties to open up more of its goodies.

From a distance, it looks like an amazing, unique project, full of creativity. But the closer you get to it, and the more time you spend working your way through its levels, MadWorld loses a lot of its charm, quickly becoming a slow-paced brawler that shows you all of its best tricks in the first ten minutes. Everything else, from the game's unique art style to its rampant use of blood and cursing, feels like a sleight-of-hand trick designed to make you think the game is more than it really is. If you can keep up the suspension of disbelief, MadWorld is probably pretty amazing. But after hearing the announcers repeat the same handful of phrases again and again for the first hour, and seeing the same death animations applied to multiple levels and multiple opponents, all I could see was the basic, repetitive fighting underneath MadWorld's thick layer of style.<br/><br/> The game takes place inside some sort of futuristic terrorist-run killing game show known as DeathWatch, and it's sort of like  <i>The Running Man</i> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16194\" href=\"/smash-tv/3030-16194/\" slug=\"smash-tv\"> Smash TV</a>. The organizers of the game\u00a0have cut off access to a large island in a big city and given everyone some sort of virus. The virus vaccine is given to people who agree to join the game by killing one of their fellow citizens. You play as a tough guy named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8955\" href=\"/jack-cayman/3005-8955/\" slug=\"jack-cayman\"> Jack</a>, who, at first, appears to be nothing more than a contestant. But as you play, you'll discover his true motives for being on the island and in the game. The story is loosely told between levels, and it's just enough to provide a point to all this madness.<br/><br/> MadWorld is level-based, and most of the levels are relatively open. You can run around anywhere and beat up standard enemies to your heart's content. But the levels progress via your points total. So as you earn points for taking out enemies, you'll earn additional weapons, health recovery items, minigames that can be played for more points, and eventually, the boss battle. The control in MadWorld is effective, using Nunchuk shaking to avoid incoming attacks and Wii Remote shaking to\u00a0pull off different attacks or toss enemies onto various death-dealing contraptions.<br/><br/> You'll earn more points for eliminating enemies with combos, but there's more to the combat than just using your fists. The combos let you take tires or other similarly hoop-like items and ring a guy to immobilize him. Then, you might want to jab one or more street signs through his neck. And to finish him off, you might want to throw him in a burning garbage barrel, or toss him up against a spiked wall, or maybe lay him down on a catapult that's helpfully pointed at a statue's large, sharp sword. Or maybe you just want to unleash your retractable chainsaw and cut him in half. While the later levels use higher point totals to coerce you into playing along with the combo system, it's usually pretty easy to just grind out the points with less-elaborate kills. While there's always a time limitl, you usually have plenty of time to get things done.<br/><br/> The problem is that there really isn't all that much to do. Even though you change environments, the basics of the action remain the same. In the city levels you'll find tires, street signs, and trains with spikes on the side. In the castle you'll find big gears, lamp posts, and meat hooks. In the \"Asian Town\" set you'll find spiky trees and lanterns, and so on. The action doesn't really change too much from level to level. The boss fights do offer some differences, but it's not enough. While you can slug it out with each boss and hope for the best, you're better off trying to trigger a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\"> Quick Time Event</a>, which are easy to pull off and do significant damage. The catch is that each boss only has one QTE, so you might be performing each one three or four times over the course of a battle.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/874849-mad6m.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874849\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/874849-mad6m.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874849\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7423/874849-mad6m.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The art style really makes the blood stand out.</figcaption></figure>Of course, it helps that those interactive cutscenes look great. The entire game has a terrific sense of style to it, presenting most of its action in black and white, only making exceptions for red blood and yellow action words to give jumps, hard landings, and cutscenes a little more flair. The blood splatters around quite well, staining the otherwise-stark landscape in a dramatic fashion.<br/><br/> The game's audio gets to be a bit much. In addition to the standard sounds of fighting and the splats of bodies coming apart, the game's soundtrack is an aggressive, rap-fueled collection of music, most of it featuring vocals. On top of that, the game has a two-man commentary team who chatter constantly while you're playing. When you first dive in, it's pretty intense, and a lot of the commentary is really funny. But it's one of those things that's only great from a distance. If you spend time focusing on the music, you'll realize that most of the songs only have one repeating verse... and that they really aren't very good. The commentary sounds great at first, with a lot of natural back and forth between the two announcers, but if you single that out and really listen to it, you'll quickly realize that they're constantly repeating themselves. Weirdly enough, the audio mix sounds like it was mixed so that no one element stands out, like they knew that if you paid any actual attention to any one aspect of it, you'd notice that it was kind of crummy.<br/><br/> And really, that same statement could be applied to the entirety of MadWorld. It makes an amazing first impression, and it has a consistently great sense of style. But once I started digging deeper, I hit bottom fast, and the spell was broken. If you're the type of person who can appreciate style-over-substance games, you'll probably love it.

Of course, so does everyone else.</figcaption></figure>Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars is a very different kind of GTA game than the ones you're used to playing. That's a very good thing. Rather than trying to capture the essence of GTA's console experience on a handheld--like Rockstar attempted on the PSP--Grand Theft Auto for the DS is its own thing, custom-built from the ground up so that it makes sense on Nintendo's handheld. That means that you're going to get a different ratio of story and satire to gameplay than you might expect, but despite the different formula, Chinatown Wars comes out a winner.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game's story isn't especially deep. You play as a guy named Huang, and you're delivering your deceased father's ceremonial sword to your uncle, as per family tradition. As soon as you step off the plane, you're grazed with a bullet to the head and the sword is stolen. You'll spend the rest of the game looking for the sword and attempting to sniff out a snitch in your ranks. Rather than the character-heavy stuff Rockstar did in GTA IV, the script in Chinatown Wars is a bit more lighthearted. As Huang, you encounter the typical batch of screw-ups, junkies, porn fiends, cross-dressers, and dirty cops you might expect to see in Grand Theft Auto, but as the mission dealers give out their deliberately atrocious dialogue, Huang is there to eat them up and deliver zingers about how, well, awful their dialogue is. It's a slightly different brand of humor than you get from most other GTA games, but Huang's smart-ass act is decent enough to keep things moving, even if there's no actual speech in the cutscenes.</div><div><br/></div><div>It's the technical side of Chinatown Wars that makes it so impressive. Liberty City is large, and you see the whole thing from a slightly cocked top view that lets you see what's on the road ahead while you drive. It gives the whole thing a classic feel, provided you're old enough to define \"classic GTA\" as the games that came before GTA III. Objects in the world are defined by thick, black edges, and these lines give the whole world a comic book kind of feel. In motion, the game is almost always very, very smooth. The high frame rate on the action really brings the world to life, and you feel like you're high above, watching a cute little clockwork city with a dramatic organized crime problem.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/887488-gtacw05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-887488\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74647887323944\" data-width=\"355\" style=\"width: 355px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/887488-gtacw05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-887488\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/19745/887488-gtacw05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Building your own sniper rifle is but one of the touch screen actions you'll perform.</figcaption></figure>The gameplay and mission structure is the most GTA-like part of the entire pacakge. You'll run cars off the road, follow people around without being spotted, snipe enemies from a rooftop, chop down foes with a sword, get in car races, and so on. The standard side missions are also in place, so you can hop in a taxi and take fares, hop in a cop car and catch criminals, deliver food, and more. There's also a large drug dealing side to Chinatown, and the basic rules of buying low and selling high apply. You don't do any street slanging as part of this; you merely ferry packages of drugs from one dealer to another. You'll occasionally receive tips that tell you if a specific dealer is in need of some coke (making him willing to pay above the normal market rates), or maybe another dealer is having a blow-out on heroin (meaning you can score for next to nothing). Keeping an eye on these tips will get you a ton of money, fast. The catch is that you don't really need a lot of money to succeed, so aside from a few mission-specific objectives, like one where a guy needs you to bring him some ecstasy before he'll let you do a mission, you don't really need to do any of this stuff.</div><div><br/></div><div>Changing the perspective to more of a top-down view makes the controls in Chinatown Wars easy to grasp. For the most part, you're using the D-pad to move around and steer, the face buttons for fighting when on foot or driving when behind the wheel, and the triggers are used for camera control and targeting. The touch screen comes up fairly often, though, as it's used to select GPS routes, check your e-mail, and all sorts of other little things that require your in-game PDA. You'll also partake in a collection of minigame-like activities at various points. Stealing cars with alarms will pop up a hotwiring screen where you have to remove screws to expose a panel, then drag the two wires together and draw a circle to twist them together. Fancier cars have more elaborate alarms and, thus, more elaborate requirements.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/932314-72781020090316_152105_0_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932314\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74803149606299\" data-width=\"254\" style=\"width: 254px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/932314-72781020090316_152105_0_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932314\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7423/932314-72781020090316_152105_0_big.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7423/932314-72781020090316_152105_0_big.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Blowing up stuff is still a good way to get the cops on your ass.</figcaption></figure>But the touch screen stuff never gets too complicated. In addition to car alarms you'll smash locks, rewire control panels to open gates, assemble sniper rifles, work the controls of a crane, restart a pesky motorboat engine... you get the idea. Because of all this, you either need to be OK with using the touch screen with your fingers, or you'll need to play with a stylus in-hand, just in case something breaks out. It's gimmicky and sort of silly, but it doesn't happen so often that you'll get tired of seeing them. However, some of it does go a touch overboard. The drug dealing interface requires you to tap to open car trunks or satchels to trade goods, when a simple screen full of numbers would have been a bit faster.</div><div><br/></div><div>Chinatown Wars is understandably shorter than the standard GTA game, as well. I completed the story in just under five-and-a-half hours. Of course, if you're the sort of person who gets wrapped up in all the side stuff, you'll be left with plenty more to do outside of the main missions. Online, the game will log into the Rockstar Social Club to put you on leaderboards and such. Locally, you can play a handful of two-player modes that put you in races, deathmatches, racing deathmatches, and others.</div><div><br/></div><div>Chinatown Wars is an impressively designed game. The developers at Rockstar Leeds were very smart about which elements of GTA to carry over and which would just drag the final product down. The end result is a game that feels new and fresh, even though it largely relies on the concepts forged in GTA's past.</div>", "deck": "GTA: Chinatown Wars looks amazing on the DS, and the game retains enough of what Grand Theft Auto fans are looking for to make for a great experience.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-125/", "platforms": "Nintendo DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21100/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-chinatown-wars/3030-21100/", "id": 21100, "name": "Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-03-23 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-80198/", "id": 80198, "name": "Grand Theft Auto: Chinatown Wars"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wwe-legends-of-wrestlemania-review/1900-126/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/326253-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-326253\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/326253-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-326253\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9446/326253-01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Andre is not impressed.</figcaption></figure>WWE Legends of Wrestlemania tries very hard to take things back to a simpler time--and I'm not just talking about the roster of classic wrestlers from the 1980s and 1990s. It's also trying to appeal to a larger audience of wrestling fans with a very simple, easy-to-understand style of gameplay. The game creates a great vibe, and many of the control ideas are smartly executed, but that simple gameplay ends up translating into short move lists, which makes the matches a little boring. Also, that simple control style makes the multiplayer feel flat.</div><div><br/></div><div>Legends of Wrestlemania focuses on including wrestlers who were impactful from the time of the first Wrestlemania event in 1985 to Wrestlemania XV in 1999. This means you see guys like Big John Studd, Greg \"The Hammer\" Valentine, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3324\" href=\"/mr-perfect/3005-3324/\" slug=\"mr-perfect\">Mr. Perfect</a>, \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper, Andre the Giant, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-247\" href=\"/hulk-hogan/3005-247/\" slug=\"hulk-hogan\">Hulk Hogan</a> on a character select screen along with guys who are still in the ring, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-469\" href=\"/triple-h/3005-469/\" slug=\"triple-h\">Hunter Hearst-Helmsley</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-581\" href=\"/steve-austin/3005-581/\" slug=\"steve-austin\">\"Stone Cold\" Steve Austin</a>, and <span>The Rock</span>. With over 40 wrestlers to choose from, it serves as a great history lesson, depicting both the big stars of the era, as well as some of the mid-card guys. While there are plenty of wrestlers in the game, there are a few glaring gaps in the roster, such as Mankind and Diesel, both of whom are currently working for WWE's competition over at TNA. Also, \"Macho Man\" Randy Savage is a tragic omission.</div><div><br/></div><div>When playing Legends of Wrestlemania, you'll only use the analog stick and the four face buttons. That's it. For someone who finds that the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-128\" href=\"/wwe-smackdown/3025-128/\" slug=\"wwe-smackdown\">SmackDown! series</a> has gotten ridiculously complicated (because it has), it's refreshing to actually be able to play a wrestling game without feeling like you're trying to simulate an actual sport. The Legends scheme is easy to understand, and it still allows you to strike, grapple, and reverse your opponent's attacks. The downside is that move selection is way down, and the moves you perform are governed by the current status of your three-level momentum meter. If you're at level three and do a strong grapple, you'll do the same move, every single time. Same for a level two normal grapple, or a level one grapple, and so on. This, combined with the game's increased focus on canned animations--which, to be fair, make the game look a lot more like wrestling looks on television--makes the gameplay a little too stripped down for its own good. Even players who prefer the simplified gameplay style will probably get tired of seeing the same headlocks and suplexes again and again.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/326252-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-326252\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9446/326252-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-326252\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9446/326252-12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This is exactly how it should have gone down.</figcaption></figure>  The single-player modes in Legends let you relive or tweak key matches from Wrestlemania's history. Each of these conflicts are set up with terrific video packages that both detail the story-line circumstances leading up to the pay-per-view match and show you the crucial moments of the match you're going to be re-enacting. How it goes from there depends on which mode you're in. In the \"relive\" mode, you're going to be attempting to recreate the outcome of the original match by playing as the real-life winner. While you're free to play and win as you see fit, the game gives you a list of objectives to complete along the way that help your in-game match synch up with things that happened in the actual match. This is a really cool idea that makes the matches seem more meaningful than your average wrestling game. Instead of just charging up to do a finisher as quickly as possible, you'll have to drag opponents down to the entryway, trigger animations where one wrestler chokes another with a cable, and then drag them back. Or maybe you'll need to bust someone open with a chair to the face, or attack first, or make sure to finish with a submission hold, and so on. While the lists get sort of ridiculous towards the end of the relive matches, it's great. Unfortunately, there are only seven matches in relive mode, and you can breeze through them in no time.</div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to reliving a handful of matches, other Wrestlemania matches appear in the \"rewrite\" and \"redefine\" modes. Like the relive set, these matches start off with video packages that detail the actual events. But in rewrite mode, you'll change the outcome by winning the match. In some cases, you're playing to get a pinfall win to earn a title, instead of winning by disqualification. There are objectives here, too, but they're all very generic, like \"win the match\" or \"use a strong grapple.\" It's a shame that key moments from these matches weren't included with a slight twist to set up the altered outcome, because these matches just feel hollow compared to the relive mode. Rewrite takes old match-ups and brings them into new circumstances. What if Andre the Giant and Big John Studd fought in a Hell in a Cell match? In these matches, you can choose either wrestler, but the objectives are just as generic as they are when you're rewriting matches.</div><div><br/></div><div>There's also a survival mode called \"legend killer\" where you're given multiple tiers of ten wrestlers each. You'll need to conserve and carefully recover health during the matches to make it to the end. In this mode, you play as a created wrestler, and you earn experience points that are later used to increase your created wrestler's stats. Along with the standard offline multiplayer options, you can also take the game online and get into matches with up to three other players. When playing against other people, the game becomes more challenging, but not in a way that makes things more exciting. The different moves at your disposal don't feel balanced, meaning that some attacks feel like they are right for any situation, while others feel sort of useless. Also, in some of the matches I played, the game felt like it gave the match host a real advantage on the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">Quick Time Events</a> used for whipping people into the ropes, mat wrestling, and finishers.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/884669-4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-884669\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"2.4276729559748\" data-width=\"159\" style=\"width: 159px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:242.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/870/884669-4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-884669\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/870/884669-4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/870/884669-4.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Though Heenan appears as a manager, it just makes you miss his commentary skills that much more.</figcaption></figure>Another neat inclusion is the ability to unlock the entire roster from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20680\" href=\"/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009/3030-20680/\" slug=\"wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2009\">SmackDown! vs. RAW 2009</a>. All this requires is having a saved game from that game on your machine, and it makes the roster huge. It also sets up some interesting matches. Can Big Show beat Andre the Giant? Can John Cena beat Hulk Hogan? It's pretty cool, but for some dumb reason you can't pit a current version of a wrestler against his past self. So even though you'll find \"classic\" Ric Flair on the Legends roster and \"modern\" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-594\" href=\"/ric-flair/3005-594/\" slug=\"ric-flair\">Ric Flair</a> on the SmackDown! import, you can't have them wrestle each other. Also, the player models made for Legends are pumped up and almost cartoonishly huge. Next to these guys, the more-realistic models of SmackDown! look like toothpicks. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-470\" href=\"/john-cena/3005-470/\" slug=\"john-cena\">John Cena</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-604\" href=\"/mr-kennedy/3005-604/\" slug=\"mr-kennedy\">Mr. Kennedy</a> look scrawny when standing alongside guys like Hulk Hogan or Ultimate Warrior. It's not a big deal, but I chose to take it as unintentional commentary on the steroid-fueled lifestyle that some wrestlers of the 1980s chose to live, which made it all sort of comedic. The rest of the graphics are pretty good, but there are plenty of clipping issues and other weird stuff, like the way wrestling belts aren't actually touching some wrestlers when worn around the waist. It looks sloppy and unpolished in spots.</div><div><br/></div><div>On the audio side, the game uses the standard type of wrestling commentary you've come to expect from SmackDown!, which is to say that it isn't particularly good. However, the matches in the relive mode are better, with plenty of custom phrases, some of which actually came from the original match commentary. However, all of the talking is done by <a data-ref-id=\"3025-130\" href=\"/wwe/3025-130/\" slug=\"wwe\">WWE</a>'s current announcers, Jim Ross and Jerry \"The King\" Lawler. While some combinations would be impossible to record (like Gorilla Monsoon and Bobby \"The Brain\" Heenan), it might have been nice to hear Vince McMahon and Jesse \"The Body\" Ventura or something like that. Either way, the commentary only barely matches up with the action and often skips out on using names, resulting in \"he did this\" and \"did you see that?\" sort of lines.</div><div><br/></div><div>If nothing else, WWE Legends of Wrestlemania is a good first attempt by THQ at delivering the classics in a way that's accessible to a larger crowd.

I found it completely enjoyable, silly as hell, and totally dumb in all the right ways. The movie was fueled by the same sort of slick emptiness that, for better or for worse, fuels most of the best action games. In fact, while I was watching the movie, I couldn't help but notice that it's a real shame that games can't portray the tightly choreographed motion of movies without relying on crutches like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\"> Quick Time Events</a> or cutscenes that ensure that the script's best action requires little to no input from the player. With that in mind, I was really interested in seeing what the video game sequel to the 2008 film was going to offer. The answer is that Wanted: Weapons of Fate is slick in small doses, awkward in spots, and so short that it's really hard to recommend it at its current price point.<br/><br/> Weapons of Fate picks up where the movie left off. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6195\" href=\"/wesley-gibson/3005-6195/\" slug=\"wesley-gibson\"> Wesley Gibson</a> has already transformed himself from an anxiety-filled office worker into a card-carrying assassin. He's managed to kill his own father, as well as most of the other assassins who tricked him into committing patricide in the first place. So now he's living among his father's things and attempting to learn more about his origins. But, as you might expect, clearing out one segment of a worldwide order of assassins means that other parts of the organization are going to come calling sooner or later. So you're quickly sent off on a nine-level journey that both tells the tale of Wesley tracking down his father's nemesis while also flashing back and putting you in his father's shoes to let you know how the rivalry you're setting off to finish came to be in the first place.<br/><br/> It's becoming such a common shooter sub-genre that you almost don't need to spell it out anymore, but in case you haven't figured it out, Wanted: Weapons of Fate is a good-looking third-person shooter that relies heavily on a cover mechanic. It is very much a product of a post-<a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\"> Gears-of-War</a> world, but that's not to say it's some sort of heartless clone. In this story, Wesley has some pretty special abilities--the most important of which is the ability to curve bullets. When you combine people hiding behind corners with bullets that can bend around corners, you get a sharp new way to eliminate your targets. When doing this, a line extends from the barrel of your gun. You can lock onto a hiding enemy with this line, then curve the line around until you find a viable trajectory for your shot. It almost feels unfair, but you can't just use it whenever you want.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/895857-wanted_win32_release_2009_01_22_12_20_30_86.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-895857\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.62482566248257\" data-width=\"1434\" style=\"width: 1434px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/895857-wanted_win32_release_2009_01_22_12_20_30_86.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-895857\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/895857-wanted_win32_release_2009_01_22_12_20_30_86.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Though you'll be firing pistols through the entire game, the bullet curving keeps that from being a problem.</figcaption></figure>Killing enemies earns adrenaline points. When you first unlock the bullet bending skill, you can only have one point stored. Eventually you can store up to four, and you'll also get additional skills, like a slow-motion run that moves you from one point of cover to another. While moving up, the game slows down, giving you plenty of time to take out multiple enemies along the way. Later on, you'll get a pair of machine pistols that can fire off a barrage of exploding, curving bullets. Your pistol and these dual machine pistols are the game's only weapons, which may sound a bit weird for a game of this sort, but since you're spending all your time getting headshots and curving bullets, the simple act of firing a gun doesn't get tired.<br/><br/> Of course, you could argue that the game doesn't give you enough time to actually get tired. Wanted's nine levels absolutely fly by, and I'd guess that many players will finish it in one sitting without even realizing that the end is always near. It's the sort of thing that you can finish in five hours or so. There are additional modes to unlock that require you to focus more on headshots or up-close melee strikes, and you can go back through the game using a different character model or play on three different difficulty settings, but even when you add all that together, it doesn't make for a very replayable experience.<br/><br/> Wanted: Weapons of Fate kind of gets it from both ends. It's a short game, but if it were longer, the excitement of bullet curving would probably wear off. That said, it's got some cool concepts and it compliments the film fairly well. If you can find it for less-than-full price, it's worth checking out.", "deck": "Wanted: Weapons of Fate is fun while it lasts, but it doesn't last very long and doesn't give you great reasons to play through it a second time.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-127/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21621/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wanted-weapons-of-fate/3030-21621/", "id": 21621, "name": "Wanted: Weapons of Fate"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-03-30 11:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-87137/", "id": 87137, "name": "Wanted: Weapons of Fate"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/resistance-retribution-review/1900-128/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/335022-image4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-335022\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/335022-image4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-335022\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/335022-image4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The PSP-oriented controls make this a shooter that works on a handheld.</figcaption></figure>Sony made a wise choice in tapping its <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2255\" href=\"/sony-bend/3010-2255/\" slug=\"sony-bend\"> Bend, Oregon</a> studio to bring the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-667\" href=\"/resistance/3025-667/\" slug=\"resistance\"> Resistance</a> franchise to the PSP. While other developers have had varying amounts of success in designing console-style action games for the PSP's limited input scheme, Bend did a great job mapping two quality <a data-ref-id=\"3025-314\" href=\"/syphon-filter/3025-314/\" slug=\"syphon-filter\"> Syphon Filter</a> games to those controls. That expertise has carried over to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21109\" href=\"/resistance-retribution/3030-21109/\" slug=\"resistance-retribution\"> Resistance: Retribution</a>, a third-person shooter that fills in some background for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1379\" href=\"/insomniac-games/3010-1379/\" slug=\"insomniac-games\"> Insomniac</a>'s newest franchise and offers impressive visuals and satisfying action, by PSP standards.<br/><br/> Retribution acts as a side story that takes place between the first two PS3 games, though there's no <a data-ref-id=\"3005-479\" href=\"/nathan-hale/3005-479/\" slug=\"nathan-hale\"> Nathan Hale</a> to be seen here. You play as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5702\" href=\"/james-grayson/3005-5702/\" slug=\"james-grayson\"> James Grayson</a>, a hardened former war hero who went rogue--and a little nuts--after the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-760\" href=\"/chimera/3015-760/\" slug=\"chimera\"> Chimera</a> converted his brother to their monstrous ranks. Grayson was court-martialed and sentenced to die for his actions, but is pulled from death row by a mercenary group called the Maquis to act as a one-man wrecking crew, undermining the Chimeran empire in Europe. Grayson basically sounds and acts like <a data-ref-id=\"3040-70379\" href=\"/jason-statham/3040-70379/\" slug=\"jason-statham\"> Jason Statham</a>, and his salty, sarcastic interactions with the other members of the resistance movement are often well-written and funny. You won't get much clarity on Resistance 2's nebulous storyline, but the game does offer a couple of interesting twists and gives you a close-up look at the nasty business the Chimera are getting up to, behind the scenes.<br/><br/> Veterans of the PSP Syphon Filter games will instantly recognize the two control configurations in Retribution. You can use the analog stick to move and the face buttons to aim, or vice versa, and both options work equally well. The one you choose is really just a matter of taste. The most crucial aspect of Retribution's playability is its helpful auto-aim feature, which automatically targets enemies that are even only sort of close to the center of the screen. You might think such generous assistance would make the game too easy; on the contrary, it merely saves you from having to pull off precise aiming with the PSP's imprecise controls, a feat Bend must have realized would tax even the most skilled players' patience.<br/><br/> Retribution is hard enough, anyway. The game throws more and more tough enemies at you over the course of its lengthy campaign, so even with the auto-aim, you need deft reflexes to manage the onslaught. There's also a cover system that makes you automatically take cover just by running up to a flat surface, so avoiding attacks and trading fire with Chimeran grunts and larger enemies, like Titans, is generally a streamlined process. You've also got a healthy arsenal of weapons in the Resistance vein, from the Auger, which shoots through walls and can generate an energy field, to the Fareye, the sniper rifle that slows down time when you zoom in on your target. All the weapons have a secondary fire mode, so there's some variety and strategy in knowing which weapons to use when.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176217-e3bonn_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176217\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176217-e3bonn_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176217\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/176217-e3bonn_4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Resistance's offbeat arsenal gives the combat variety throughout the campaign.</figcaption></figure>The game also offers a pretty good multiplayer mode with a variety of basic game types that focus on team-based action. There's a control-point mode and a mode where all killed players are converted to the other team, in addition to the traditional capture-the-flag and team deathmatch gameplay. The multifunction weapons add some interesting variations to the online action, though the limitations of the controls become a little more evident when you're playing against human opponents. It can be fun to grab a match here and there, but odds are, if you're serious about multiplayer shooters, you're probably looking to do most of your shooting on a real console or PC, rather than the PSP. The single-player campaign is the main attraction here, and a better reason to play Retribution.<br/><br/> Lastly, there's a bunch of extra content you can only access if you own a PlayStation 3 and a copy of Resistance 2. You can \"infect\" your PSP by connecting it to the PS3 and game, which also infects Grayson with the Chimeran virus and changes some minor aspects of the storyline. In gameplay terms, this lets him regenerate his health and breathe underwater, and (inexplicably) gives him access to a few powerful new weapons you can't get any other way. These additions make this tough game a little more enjoyable, and locking them up behind this ownership requirement seems like a shameless way to exploit the idea of handheld-to-console connectivity by selling you more stuff you may not already have.<br/><br/> My initial response to this arrangement was one of outrage, since you only need the PSP connected long enough to confirm you own both games before you get to use the \"infected\" stuff. But the good news is, Retribution is still a great-looking, fully playable shooter even if you don't own a PlayStation 3. If you're already set up to access the extra content, think of that as a nice bonus, but don't feel like you have to run out and get Resistance 2 just to enjoy Retribution. Based on the PSP's library to date, it's clearly not easy to design a good, console-style shooter on the platform, and so far Retribution is one of the better ones.", "deck": "Retribution is a surprisingly good third-person shooter on the PSP, a platform where you don't see a lot of good third-person shooters.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-128/", "platforms": "PlayStation Portable", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21109/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/resistance-retribution/3030-21109/", "id": 21109, "name": "Resistance: Retribution"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-03-30 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73870/", "id": 73870, "name": "Resistance: Retribution"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/uno-rush-review/1900-129/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176165-in_game_shot05.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176165\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/176165-in_game_shot05.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176165\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/176165-in_game_shot05.png\"></a><figcaption>Don't let the happy avatars and simple colors fool you. This is ruthless.</figcaption></figure>OK, forget Texas Hold 'Em. I'd rather see televised <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12083\" href=\"/uno/3030-12083/\" slug=\"uno\">Uno</a> tournaments. Why? Because Uno is the <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">thinking man's</span> card game. This slow-paced game of strategy results in a lot of careful character study around my place. \"Does this guy have any more greens, or is fronting like he has greens in order to get me to change it to blue?\" It gets pretty savage. So, as an Uno fan, I was immediately excited about the prospect of a new Uno game for Xbox Live Arcade. As you may have figured from the name, Uno Rush is a faster, more rushed take on Uno, where the strategy of Uno is replaced by the more-frantic process of ensuring your deck is in the right order. While I still prefer an ice-cold game of deadly-serious Uno, Rush is a pretty cool card game.</div><div><br/></div><div>The basic rules of Uno still apply: there's a discard pile, and four players take turns playing valid cards onto the discard pile with the hopes of running out of cards before the other players do. The catch with Uno Rush is that you have about five seconds to play your cards, and rather than actually selecting and playing a card, it's your job to properly sort your hand. When your turn comes around, if a playable card is at the front of your hand, it automatically plays. If the next card combos with that first card, it plays, and so on and so forth. So while the game frantically moves from person to person, you're trying to organize your hand to combo away as many cards as possible while also keeping on eye on the other players in order to guess what color or number will be on top of the pile when your turn comes around. It's hectic, and if you end up with a lot of cards in your hand, it starts to get overwhelming.</div><div><br/></div><div>It'd probably be a little less hectic if you had better control over your hand. You're limited to just moving a cursor left or right along the bottom of your hand and moving one card at a time. There were plenty of cases when I wished I could jump to the front or back of my hand, or select a group of cards and move them all at once. That would make the hands much more manageable... which probably would defeat the purpose of the entire game, since the game always seems to hover at the edge of chaos.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game's scoring and modes are more similar to the previous Xbox Live Arcade release of Uno. You can set up partner mode games, elimination matches, and vary a collection of rules to create your own set of rules. You can also enable the Xbox Live Vision camera, but with all the intensity of Uno Rush, the camera seems like it wouldn't be of much use. Instead of all the weird things you could find people doing during a leisurely game of Uno, Rush is more likely to give you images of people leaning forward, sweating over the order of their hand. Either way, I found it tough to find anyone with a camera going in the first place. Also, since you can see all of the other players' cards, you can play offline multiplayer in Uno Rush, something you couldn't do in regular Uno.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ultimately, the length of time you spend with Uno Rush is pretty dependent on how cool you are under pressure. If the thought of a fast-paced multiplayer card game where you have to keep one eye on your cards and the other eye on three other hands excites you, chances are you'll have a great time.</div>", "deck": "Uno Rush is vastly different from its predecessor, replacing cold strategy and slow-paced fun with something much more intense.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-129/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21172/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/uno-rush/3030-21172/", "id": 21172, "name": "UNO Rush"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-03-31 20:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73976/", "id": 73976, "name": "UNO RUSH"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rhythm-heaven-review/1900-130/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/285441-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-285441\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"408\" style=\"width: 408px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4086/285441-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-285441\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4086/285441-1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Gassing up robots has never been this funky.</figcaption></figure>OK, fine, Rhythm Heaven is a simple rhythm game. Yes, when you strip everything away, you're really just tapping or sliding the DS stylus in time to the music. But to lash out at it that way is really missing the point.

The touch screen is basically blank and it doesn't matter where you touch the screen, as long as you touch it. The three actions you'll perform are tapping the screen, holding the stylus on the screen, and flicking the stylus up and off the screen. These different motions are used in different ways, depending on the game. One game puts you in control of a monkey, and you'll tap the screen to make him clap and swipe the stylus up and off the screen to make him jump. A synchronized swimming game has you holding the stylus on the screen to dive and letting off normally to resurface, though sometimes you'll have to swipe to launch up into the air. The game's practice sessions are good about telling you what you'll need to do and which audio cues correspond to the different actions.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3163/461912-tengoku03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-461912\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.665\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3163/461912-tengoku03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-461912\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3163/461912-tengoku03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Ain't no party like a Moai party, 'cause a Moai party don't stop.</figcaption></figure>There are 30 core games to play before the credits roll, but once you've seen everything once, more tiers and bonuses unlock that feature harder versions of some of the games. Plus, doing well at a game earns you a medal, and your medal count gives you access to various bonus gadgets, like a monster head that doubles as a slot machine, or a little drumming puppet that you can force to play by tapping the screen. These items don't have any real function and aren't really \"games,\" but they're neat to mess around with. You can also get endless versions of some of the games that you can attempt to play for a high score. All of this translates into a game that might not take you very long to \"finish,\" but the quest for medals and more bonuses give the game a healthy amount of replayability.</div><div><br/></div><div>Of course, the big thing people want to know about any music/rhythm game is if the music itself is any good. It's fine, and a lot of the tracks have very catchy, poppy melodies. But some players who were exposed to the Japanese version of the game may take issue with the localization. Since some of the games use speech to tell you what to do, some of those games have been updated with English lyrics. They're totally fine on their own, though maybe not quite as pleasant-sounding as their Japanese counterparts. Either way, anyone who tries to tell you that Rhythm Heaven has been \"ruined\" by its translation is being melodramatic and is definitely <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-weight:bold; \">not</span> your friend.</div><div><br/></div><div>Rhythm Heaven is a great addition to the DS library that's definitely worth checking out if you've ever liked a WarioWare game. While the style isn't identical, this game definitely shares some of WarioWare's spirit. But a quick word of warning before you run off to order a copy--you will be tapping the screen constantly, and kind of loudly while you play, and that might make the people around you lose it. I swear, the guy on the airplane last night was fidgeting around like he was going to kill me. So... watch out for that. Other than that potential danger, though?

Another dual-joystick shooter! Just what the world needs!\" Then after I got my hands on the game and started murdering undead by the hundreds, I <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">wished</span> Burn Zombie Burn was a dual-joystick shooter, because its complicated controls are a bit off-putting until you get the hang of them. It certainly lacks the pick-up-and-play familiarity of games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21167\" href=\"/geometry-wars-retro-evolved-2/3030-21167/\" slug=\"geometry-wars-retro-evolved-2\">Geometry Wars</a>, but the game's differences from the other ilk of its genre ultimately work to its advantage. If you spend some time getting to know its mechanics, there's quite a uniquely satisfying, skill-based action experience here.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>What it really took for me to enjoy this game was a run through the 15 minutes of included tutorials. Burn Zombie Burn is a complex game, by the standards of this genre, and though you can go in blind and just shoot everything that moves, you probably won't have a lot of fun with it that way. The game lives up to its name by making it your first priority to set zombies on fire, because that's how you score big points. When the zombies first spawn, they amble around aimlessly and only make a real effort to eat your brains when you get close. But on fire, their properties change significantly. They run a lot faster, and they all run <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">straight at you</span>, so setting enemies on fire with your handy torch or optional flamethrower is immediately useful as a form of crowd control since it makes them all bunch up together when they're pursuing you. You just need to make sure you have room to run away from them when you do this.</div><div><br/></div><div>More importantly, when zombies are on fire, they add to a score multiplier that can increase the points you earn by a factor of up to 100. They also drop better power-ups that increase your movement speed or the range and power of your droppable TNT, which is crucial to killing a lot of the undead buggers en masse. (Normal zombies will only drop health and ammo when you kill them.) In short, the idea is to find a balance: enflame a bunch of enemies when you have health and ammo so you can power up your TNT and then splatter all of the bastards at once for huge points; drop back and fight regular zombies when you need more health and need to clear out some space. The action takes on an interesting rhythmic quality once you get the hang of this back-and-forth process, and it was really satisfying for me to see my increasing skill result in scores 10 or 20 times higher than I was reaching before I got the hang of the game's flow.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/931348-zombies_infected.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-931348\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/931348-zombies_infected.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-931348\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/931348-zombies_infected.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mean green zombie machines.</figcaption></figure>Again, the controls here are more complicated than move-with-left-stick, shoot-with-right-stick. You're dealing with lock-ons and strafes here that feel clumsy at first, but they allow you a steadier sort of control than a dual joystick setup once you get the hang of them. Aside from the upgradable TNT, the weapons in here are mostly conducive to killing tons of zombies really quickly. Uzi, chainsaw, chain<span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">gun</span>, lawnmower: these are great, satisfying weapons to use when you're properly using fire to clump the zombies together for slaughter. There are some more unique weapons, like a soundwave device that makes the zombies dance to a tune that sounds way too much like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-173\" href=\"/michael-jackson/3005-173/\" slug=\"michael-jackson\">Michael Jackson</a>'s \"Thriller,\" and a brain launcher that lures the enemies away from you. The game's sense of humor is cheesy as hell, but who cares? You're here for the action.</div><div><br/></div><div>And there's enough action to keep you coming back long enough to justify the $10 price tag. There are six levels in the game, each of which you can play in free and timed mode, and in a \"Defend Daisy\" mode where you have to protect a pretty lady in the middle of the map from the horde. Additionally, there are 10 unique challenge levels that add or remove various restrictions on weapons and movement that make the gameplay interesting from one to the next. You can only access subsequent levels, modes, and challenges by earning medals on the previous ones, so there's a sort of linear progression to the game as you improve your skill. Finally, you can play the game in two-player, but only in a local format and only split-screen. I can live without online play, but the game looks a little cramped in split-screen and I wish the local co-op simply zoomed out to accommodate two players on the same screen instead. But then, this sort of game is better as a solo experience anyway.</div><div><br/></div><div>Burn Zombie Burn isn't for people looking for a casual action game; if you can't hang with the demands of something like Geometry Wars, this one will probably stress you out to no end. But if you enjoy getting a grip on fairly complicated mechanics and juggling them as fast as you can while you watch your scores race ever higher, there's a lot of depth in this one. Now if you'll excuse me, those gold medals aren't going to earn themselves.</div>", "deck": "This demanding new PlayStation Network shooter offers rewarding score-based action--once you commit to learning its complex, unique mechanics.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-131/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24253/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/burn-zombie-burn/3030-24253/", "id": 24253, "name": "Burn Zombie Burn!"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-04-04 09:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82503/", "id": 82503, "name": "Burn Zombie Burn!"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/watchmen-the-end-is-nigh-review/1900-132/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899076-wm_actionsc_07_streets.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899076\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899076-wm_actionsc_07_streets.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899076\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899076-wm_actionsc_07_streets.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Expect to see plenty of grimy environments like this.</figcaption></figure>Watchmen: The End is Nigh is a dark and violent  beat-'em-up based on  Zack Snyder's movie adaptation of  Alan Moore's graphic novel  <i>Watchmen</i>. It dutifully captures the gritty visual style of the source material, but it ultimately seems like a waste of the license.  <i>Watchmen</i> certainly features enough brutal violence to work as bloody pulp, but it was the way it injected the complications of reality into the simple good-versus-evil world of comic book superheroes that originally made it so seminal. Even if you don't hold  <i>Watchmen</i> dear, The End is Nigh is a lumpy, uneven thing. The production values are strong, particularly for a downloadable game, but the action is repetitive and it features a two-player co-op element that, despite being presented as core to the experience, feels awkwardly wedged in.<br/><br/> As a prequel to  <i>Watchmen</i>--taking place more than a decade before the main  <i>Watchmen</i> story arc--The End is Nigh expands a bit on the existing fiction, showing the working relationship between <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6466\" href=\"/nite-owl/3005-6466/\" slug=\"nite-owl\"> Nite Owl</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6465\" href=\"/rorschach/3005-6465/\" slug=\"rorschach\"> Rorschach</a> that is mostly just alluded to in  <i>Watchmen</i>. The game kicks off with the duo trying to help quell a prison riot, which leads them on a chase after the criminal character  The Underboss through the alleys, rooftops, and sewers of NYC. The plot advances between chapters in a simply animated style that vaguely recalls the look of the graphic novel, eventually culminating in a twisty surprise that recalls the grand conspiracy at the center of  <i>Watchmen</i>. The conundrum here is that you need to be pretty familiar with the source material to appreciate most of the twists and turns in the story here, though if you are, the game telegraphs its biggest surprise. Either way, The End is Nigh is definitely more about beating up loads of dudes than it is delivering a compelling narrative.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899075-wm_actionsc_05_streets.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899075\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899075-wm_actionsc_05_streets.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899075\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899075-wm_actionsc_05_streets.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Rorschach can pick up enemy weapons, while Nite Owl cannot. Advantage: Rorschach.</figcaption></figure>You can play as either Nite Owl or Rorscach, each of whom has his own fighting style, set of attack combos, and some unique abilities, such as Rorschach's lockpicking and Nite Owl's grapple gun. These abilities only come into play a few times over the course of the game, but they can force the two characters to take different routes for short stretches. Nite Owl has a \u201ccharge\u201d meter that you can use to electrocute nearby enemies or unleash a stun grenade, while Rorschach's got a \u201crage\u201d meter that lets him attack more quickly or bull-run into enemies, knocking them down. Nite Owl isn't as capable at dealing with groups of enemies as Rorschach, and his cleaner fighting style isn't nearly as much fun to watch as Rorschach's crazy, all-in, mad-dog approach to brawling, making it decidedly more fun to play as the psychotic Rorschach.\u00a0<br/><br/> Regardless who you play as, though, the action still boils down to punching in one of a handful of canned combos. You can button mash for the first few chapters, but it's not too long before enemies start blocking these random attacks, forcing you to rely on a handful of canned combos. You'll unlock more combos as you progress, but I eventually found myself using just one or two repeatedly, occasionally triggering one of the special moves when things got too hectic.\u00a0<br/><br/> The End is Nigh also makes some curious choices concerning how the two-player dynamic works. When playing solo, you'll be accompanied by whichever character you don't choose to play as, and that choice sticks with you for the duration of the game. There's no hot-swapping characters, and if you want to play as the other guy, you have to start a whole new game from scratch. While the AI seems to be active and engaged, it's neither a liability, nor does put a huge dent in the swarms of enemies. Not having to rely too heavily on an AI partner seems like generally a good thing, though if you want to play The End is Nigh with a friend, you can only do it locally. On top of that, the game opts for a split-screen perspective, which is functional, though it definitely has an effect on the frame rate. After spending a couple hours beating up two sizes of enemies in groups of varying size, The End is Nigh wraps up with a fairly dull boss fight.\u00a0<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899072-rorschachfinishing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899072\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899072-rorschachfinishing.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899072\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899072-rorschachfinishing.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899072-rorschachfinishing.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Back-alley dentistry, Watchmen-style.</figcaption></figure>I feel an urge to cut The End is Nigh a little slack here, as even with its brief runtime, its production values are quite sharp. The environments aren't huge, and there's a distinct issue with enemy variety, but there's a grimy dampness to everything and moody lighting that really makes it look like the comic book come to life. There are plenty of great little touches too, with the constantly shifting ink blot on Rorschach's \u201cface\u201d standing out in particular. While the fight animations get repetitive real quick, they still pack a good, visceral punch, with blood and teeth spraying at nearly every enemy encounter. Both Patrick Wilson and Jackie Earle Haley provide the voices for their respective characters, and they sound fine, though the banter is a little stiff. More distracting is the fact that the game pulls up the same \u201cit's on!\u201d music cue every time a fight jumps off.<br/><br/> It's got some slick looks, but Watchmen: The End is Nigh does not feel like a fully formed game.

Riddick came pretty much out of the blue and defied all the expectations of its pedigree with a brilliant mixture of shooting, stealth, light platforming and dialog-based adventure elements, and the most vicious, in-your-face first-person melee combat I've seen before or since. It also happened to be one of the year's best-looking and most shockingly yet  <i>believably</i> brutal games. Escape From Butcher Bay was a real class act in its own right; the double whammy of its unheralded arrival and its brazen defiance of the crappy-movie-game curse truly made it one for the record books.<br/><br/> Sorry, I get a little misty thinking about how good that game really was in its day.<br/><br/> Now it's five years later, and if you didn't play Butcher Bay the first time around, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1768\" href=\"/starbreeze-studios-ab/3010-1768/\" slug=\"starbreeze-studios-ab\"> Starbreeze</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-182\" href=\"/atari-inc/3010-182/\" slug=\"atari-inc\"> Atari</a> are giving you the chance to join Riddick in his escape from the galaxy's hardest slam in a modern context with the new repackaging <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20987\" href=\"/the-chronicles-of-riddick-assault-on-dark-athena/3030-20987/\" slug=\"the-chronicles-of-riddick-assault-on-dark-athena\"> Assault on Dark Athena</a>. This is a generous piece of content, since it not only contains the entirety of Butcher Bay touched up in high definition and with a few minor graphical improvements, but also an entirely new quasi-sequel episode that takes place directly after the end of the original game. There's a smattering of multiplayer modes here too that range from decent to unnecessary, but which honestly didn't even need to be in here to make this package recommendable to fans of mature, violent action games.<br/><br/> What really hooked me in the original Butcher Bay is how thoroughly and convincingly it immersed you in the role of the galaxy's baddest mother-effer Richard B. Riddick and his utterly grim, fatalistic world. From the moment the bounty hunter  Johns (Cole Hauser, in his role from  <i>Pitch Black</i>) and the head guard Abbot (played by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4145\" href=\"/xzibit/3005-4145/\" slug=\"xzibit\"> Xzibit</a>--yeah, the rapper) lead you through the gates of the prison, you're really  <i>in</i> that world. You don't just start shooting and slashing your way to freedom; you have to integrate into the prison's hierarchy, wheeling and dealing with the other inmates for favors, for shivs and other makeshift weapons, for information. You spend nearly as much time sneaking through the guards' quarters or engaged in well-written conversations with prisoners as you do sneaking up on people and snapping their necks, or doing the old run-and-gun thing. The game's cast is literally dozens of characters strong, all with unique faces, voices, and personalities, and Riddick's arguably the best of them. He's an amazingly deadpan, badass character, and like him or not, Vin Diesel's throaty delivery really brings him to life from one excellent one-liner to the next.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/869535-005.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869535\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.48125\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/869535-005.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869535\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11423/869535-005.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>The melee combat packs a serious punch.</figcaption></figure>Those kinds of narrative and environmental aspects are timeless, and they carry over into the Assault on Dark Athena episode which picks up directly after you (spoiler!) escape from Butcher Bay in the first game. Riddick is captured by a mercenary ship aboard which the nefarious crew is creating a legion of armed techno-zombie drones from its prisoners. So, of course, you end up fighting a ton of both mercs and the less intelligent drones throughout this campaign. There are plenty of memorable characters anchoring the story here, including the ship's hard-ass captain Revas (Michelle Forbes, who I'll always remember as Ensign Ro Laren from  <i>Star Trek: The Next Generation</i>) and a fellow prisoner voiced by Lance Henriksen, of  <i>Aliens</i> and plenty of other sci-fi movies and TV shows. (I don't know why most of the dudes in Riddick's world sound like they smoke three packs a day, but that's just one of the many elements that gives it such a hard edge.) The pacing in Dark Athena is less even than in Butcher Bay, but it's got that same gritty reality to it that makes it well worth playing from beginning to end.<br/><br/> If you're wondering why I keep doing that pretentious list-every-noteworthy-voice-actor-and-their-non-game-credits thing like I'm a movie critic, it's because those characters and plenty of others really are such standouts. Some of the one-on-one dialogue-tree sequences in Butcher Bay and even more so in Dark Athena--scenes that would be rote and boring in a lot of other games--are utterly gripping here due to the convincing  <i>realness</i> of the scoundrels you're dealing with. These people are absolute scum who range from sociopaths to far worse. One prisoner in Dark Athena in particular got so under my skin with his disturbing behavior that I was both sickened and genuinely relieved when I had a chance to kill him. The game has among the best writing, voiceover, blocking, and character animation I've seen in this sort of game, and that makes these characters so unsettling and your interactions with them so riveting.<br/><br/> In gameplay terms, the Butcher Bay port in this package uses pretty much the exact same blueprint the original did in 2004, and the Assault on Dark Athena episode also relies on those same mechanics, though it uses them in different proportions. The former reins in the shooting, giving the stealth and the lulls in the action room to breathe. Dark Athena leans more heavily on shooting and wasn't quite as engrossing for me for that reason. Both of the games still play quite well after all this time, though it's important to remember going into this package that a lot has changed in five years in terms of game design. Some aspects of the controls and your interactions with enemies feel a little antiquated at times compared to fresher games. The shooting isn't as refined as you might want, and the AI can act a little goofy when you disable lights to give yourself more darkness to hide in. Despite occasional moments of frustration, though, both halves of the Riddick whole offer a gameplay experience that's noticeably different from other first-person games on the market, even today.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/869531-001.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869531\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.48125\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:48.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/11423/869531-001.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-869531\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11423/869531-001.jpeg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/11423/869531-001.jpeg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Yo dawg I heard you like weird casting choices!\"</figcaption></figure>At any rate, it must be a credit to Butcher Bay's excellence that its gameplay holds up five years later as well as it does. The same goes for the graphics, which were way ahead of their time in 2004 and still stack up to other recent games in high definition now. Dark Athena does look a bit better than Butcher Bay, though the older game still looks way more than serviceable too. More than anything, it's important to know that nothing here looks like a port from the last hardware generation.<br/><br/> I remember a minor outcry going up back when the first game came out about its lack of multiplayer. I've never understood the idea that every first-person action game should have a multiplayer mode; Butcher Bay was a great single-player experience and multiplayer didn't even need to enter the equation. Nevertheless, you get plenty of online action here. The most interesting mode is Pitch Black, where one player as Riddick uses the eyeshine ability to kill mercs armed with flashlights in a completely dark level. Kill Riddick, become him. This mode is cool in concept but can be hit-or-miss in practice; since there's only one Riddick, you can go several rounds without ever seeing him or getting to shoot at anything, so it sometimes devolves into a lot of blind flashlight-waving. The other modes are inspired by game types you've seen in other shooters. There's a Rocket Arena-style one-on-one or two-on-two mode, and a Counter-Strike-style three-way team battle where you buy gear before each round and deliver a crucial item to a score point. And of course, look for standard Capture the Flag and deathmatch types. But again, the shooting isn't in the same league as games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2133\" href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare\"> Call of Duty</a>, so I didn't get a lot out of the multiplayer here.<br/><br/> The real attraction in this package is the one-two punch of Butcher Bay and Dark Athena, which combined will take you quite a while to complete and offer plenty of value on their own. This game went through some turmoil when previous publisher Vivendi shed some of its projects after the Activision merger, but I'm glad Atari swooped in to save the day and I'm glad the developer took the initiative to revive Butcher Bay and give it such a thorough spit-shine in the first place.

It's not really a game, though. Master of Illusion is a series of magic tricks that are done in conjunction with the DS. It's sort of a neat idea, like an electronic version of the old book or video, <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AlEDjrXouF0\" rel=\"nofollow\">Penn &amp; Teller's Cruel Tricks for Dear Friends</a>. Express: Funny Face takes two tricks from the cart-based version of the game and breaks them out as a two-dollar DSiWare purchase. This isn't a terrific deal--the tricks themselves are pretty dopey, and even if they were good, you can currently buy the full Master of Illusion game--which comes with over 20 tricks--for around $13.</div><div><br/></div><div>The Funny Face trick works best when you have a deck of cards. The idea is that your mark will pick a card, you'll ask to see it, and then you'll draw a face on the DS screen that \"magically\" recites the chosen card. It doesn't take too much to figure out that how you draw the face determines what the DS says. Sorry for, you know, ruining the trick. To its credit, the application does a good job of teaching you how to keep talking during the trick and distract your victim.\u00a0You also get a \"bonus trick\" called Vanishing Card, where you select five cards. The DS asks you to focus on one card, and then it makes the card disappear. Magic!</div><div><br/></div><div>It's hard to complain too much about something that's only selling for two bucks, but Master of Illusion Express: Funny Face feels like the sort of thing that would normally be a free demo designed to entice people into picking up the full package.

Beans slowly fall from the sky, and it's your goal to catch the beans with your tongue. The higher the beans are when you grab them--which requires careful timing on your part to ensure that the tip of your tongue reaches the right spot at the right time--the more points you earn. If a bean hits your bird, the game ends. If a bean hits the ground, that chunk of the ground is knocked out, limiting your movement. White beans will replace one missing ground block when eaten, and flashing beans fill up all of the holes. Beans. Things speed up quickly as you play, making things hectic and adding some real pressure.</div><div><br/></div><div>Once you get decent at the original, the game unlocks Bird &amp; Beans 2.

It's your job to match up three or more blocks of the same color either horizontally or vertically. While this formula is as old as time itself, AQUIA does it in a way that few games have done before, and it does it with an interesting, underwater-themed look.</div><div><br/></div><div>Rather than shuffling the blocks around like Bejeweled or dropping blocks like Tetris, AQUIA has you shoving blocks into the sides of the well. Doing so shoves out blocks on the other side, and these blocks become the pieces that you slide up and down the side of the puzzle and rotate, if necessary. When you insert those pieces, more blocks pop out on the other side, and so on and so forth. It's your aim to match up the colored blocks to fill a meter (represented by a diver that dives deeper as you match blocks) and finish the level. If you happen to have played <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20609\" href=\"/piyotama/3030-20609/\" slug=\"piyotama\">Piyotama</a> for the PlayStation Network (all two of you, go on, raise your hands), the gameplay will sound kind of familiar. The game comes in a timed mode that lets you know how long it took to clear the level, as well as a free dive mode that doesn't time you.</div><div><br/></div><div>In both modes, though, you're fighting against a time limit, represented by the diver's oxygen supply, as well as the screen itself. The puzzle begins to vanish from the top down as your oxygen is depleted. Clearing blocks gives you a bit of oxygen, and connecting special blocks lets you refill the oxygen tanks. So there are ways to push back death's sweet embrace. You can also select the type of pieces you want to be working with. The easiest is a two-block vertical stack. There is also a horizontal two-block option and a four-block square. Since you're shoving more pieces into and out of the puzzle, the different block types do have a significant impact on the complexity and difficulty of the game. Higher levels also add additional block colors, giving you another thing to constantly consider. All told, it's got enough depth to keep you satisfied.</div><div><br/></div><div>The visuals are fairly simple, though bubbles flow upward to let you know if you're chaining together strings of block matches, and you'll unlock some new aquarium backgrounds in the different levels. Each level has slightly different music and sound effects, not entirely unlike a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-488\" href=\"/lumines/3025-488/\" slug=\"lumines\">Lumines</a> game--but most of the music fits the same dreamy, underwater style.</div><div><br/></div><div>At 500 points ($5), Art Style: AQUIA is a good deal, and one of the better DSiWare games currently available.</div>", "deck": "Art Style: AQUIA is a good, basic puzzle game with enough of a hook to keep you coming back for more.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-136/", "platforms": "DSiWare", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24932/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/art-style-aquia/3030-24932/", "id": 24932, "name": "Art Style: AQUIA"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-04-07 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82243/", "id": 82243, "name": "Art Style: AQUIA"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/brain-age-express-math-review/1900-137/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915582-a_little_brain_training_science_edition_98928_0005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915582\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"408\" style=\"width: 408px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915582-a_little_brain_training_science_edition_98928_0005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915582\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/915582-a_little_brain_training_science_edition_98928_0005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Duhhhh... seven?</figcaption></figure>Brain Age Express: Math is a selection of math-oriented minigames taken from the DS releases of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5482\" href=\"/brain-age-train-your-brain-in-minutes-a-day/3030-5482/\" slug=\"brain-age-train-your-brain-in-minutes-a-day\">Brain Age</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14816\" href=\"/brain-age2-more-training-in-minutes-a-day/3030-14816/\" slug=\"brain-age2-more-training-in-minutes-a-day\">Brain Age 2</a>. For me, a lot of the appeal of Brain Age was that it had different types of games in it, designed to \"stimulate different parts of the brain\" or whatever vaguely scientific mumbo-jumbo it spits at you. Forget about the weird pseudo-science, the cool part about all that is that the game offered variety. Combining a bunch of math minigames into one collection, then, becomes a bit less attractive, especially when this DSiWare downloadable release is selling for nearly half the price of a full Brain Age game for DS.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>The bulk of Brain Age Express is devoted to the basic math minigames found in the previous Brain Age releases. You'll find such hits as \"Calculations X 20\" and \"Calculations X 100\" in the training section. There are eight training games in all, giving you plenty of opportunities to add numbers together, subtract them from one another, and other, somewhat more complicated tasks. You can also do a \"brain age check,\" which uses your score on three random tests to generate a number used to measure, well, how quickly and accurately you can accomplish these math-based tasks. Not that it was ever full-on science, but when you reduce the core Brain Age concept to only include your math prowess, it becomes an even more abstract concept.</div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to the math stuff, there is also a themes section that uses the DSi's built-in camera. It'll ask you to make faces that match specific moods or activities, like singing a karaoke song, looking like you've done something evil, and so on. The themes section also has you draw various things, like a panda, or Beethoven. There's also an audio theme where you record lines from a brief western script. The main idea is to have a bunch of friends also do the themes, giving you a look at how different people approach the different tasks. If you're playing alone, it's sort of a waste.</div><div><br/></div><div>But in the end, it's the price that serves as Brain Age Express: Math's biggest enemy. At 800 points, this slice of Brain Age is nearly half of the retail price of Brain Age or Brain Age 2, both of which would be a more valuable purchase than this downloadable edition.</div>", "deck": "Brain Age Express: Math is a decent collection of math-themed minigames, but it's a little too pricey to recommend.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-137/", "platforms": "DSiWare", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24922/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/brain-age-express-math/3030-24922/", "id": 24922, "name": "Brain Age Express: Math"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2009-04-07 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82242/", "id": 82242, "name": " Brain Age Express: Math"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/warioware-snapped-review/1900-138/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/852082-utsusu__made_in_wario_dsiw0001c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-852082\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/852082-utsusu__made_in_wario_dsiw0001c.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-852082\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7439/852082-utsusu__made_in_wario_dsiw0001c.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Use your fingers.</figcaption></figure>The <span><a data-ref-id=\"3025-220\" href=\"/warioware/3025-220/\" slug=\"warioware\">WarioWare</a></span> series has been a great alternative series for Nintendo. It's let the company offer something that's a little outside the norm, a little weird, and a little Japanese. It's also been great at using whatever technology the hardware it's running on has to offer. The DS WarioWare made great use of the touch screen. On the Wii it was one of the first terrific uses of the Wii's motion-sensing controller. Now, with the launch of DSiWare and the Nintendo DSi, the handheld has a camera. So WarioWare: Snapped! is right here alongside it to give you something to do with that camera.</div><div><br/></div><div>That said, Snapped! isn't really a full game. At 500 points ($5), this is more of a quick tech demo than a full retail product with the full cast of WarioWare characters. It offers four sets of five games each, and the games are all a lot easier than what you normally get from the franchise. And like every other camera game out there, it requires you to calibrate before you can play. The game is played by setting the DSi down on a table and aiming the internal camera at your face. The setup seems very picky about lighting, so you'll have to find a reasonably bright place to play. Once it's detected your face and hands, you can move on to the actual games.</div><div><br/></div><div>Before each game, the system quickly recalibrates and tells you what pose you'll need to use to play the next challenge. For some games, this just uses your head. For others, you'll use both your hands as well. The games are really basic, like tilting your head to dump a watering can over, or moving close to the camera to simulate a kiss. After five games, you're done... and it shows you the results.</div><div><br/></div><div>The results are pretty good. The game secretly records you playing and then play back a sped-up roll of you playing the game and generally wiggling and freaking out. It's funny to see and fun to show off to friends. Unfortunately, the game doesn't store your performances, so once you quit, you'll have to play again to get new clips. With four different tracks of games (one of which is designed to be played with two people) and one game played during the credits, you'll see everything there is to see really quickly.

On their own, the elements that comprised Puzzle Quest weren't particularly great. The fantasy RPG elements were boilerplate, and the puzzle action was just <a data-ref-id=\"3025-57\" href=\"/bejeweled/3025-57/\" slug=\"bejeweled\">Bejeweled</a>, but they complimented each other to make for something far more interesting and addictive. Depending on your perspective, it was either an RPG with a unique combat system, or a puzzle game with some unique context.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>After subsequently bringing Puzzle Quest to every platform in the known universe, Infinite Interactive returns with Puzzle Quest: Galactrix, which takes the same basic RPG-plus-puzzle formula, swaps out medieval fantasy for a space-faring, far-flung futuristic setting, and replaces the four-way puzzle with a six-way variant. In theory, it should be just as satisfying as its predecessor, but the returns on the formula have already diminished noticeably. The combination of RPG and puzzle doesn't seem quite as novel, and choices have been made that create an experience that's more complicated without being more fun.</div><div><br/></div><div>The story of Galactrix opens with a grim prologue recounting man's brutal conquest of the stars and its interactions with alien races that basically boils down to \u201cMan is awesome, but he's also his own worst enemy. Oh, and megacorporations.\u201d You're then dropped into the shoes of a star pilot fresh from the academy who starts off chasing pirates but eventually gets tangled up in the unethical and dangerous machinations of one of Earth's megacorps. It's all Self-Serious Sci-Fi 101, and other the the weird intonations of the voice actor who reads the prologue, it's not delivered with much flair.</div><div><br/></div><div>You'll name your pilot and choose his or her appearance from a handful of oddly angular portraits, then head off into the galaxy to take on quests, mine asteroids, hunt down pirates, hack into \u201cleapgates,\u201d and build new ships and parts, all activities which end up boiling down to playing variants of a gem-swapping puzzle game. The RPG elements in Galactrix are just palette-swaps for the original PQ, with the same basic effects. Instead of a quest party, you get a ship crew that confers bonuses during puzzle combat; instead of weapons for yourself, you get upgrades for your ship that give you new and more powerful puzzle attacks; and so on. Other than the sci-fi setting, the biggest difference between Puzzle Quest and Galactrix is the way the puzzle action itself handles.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/257343-pqgalactrix_green_purple.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-257343\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/257343-pqgalactrix_green_purple.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-257343\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/257343-pqgalactrix_green_purple.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Actually... wait, what's even going on here?</figcaption></figure>Part of the joy of Puzzle Quest was how self-apparent the puzzle gameplay was. It cribbed shamelessly from a well-established, very popular puzzle game, so even if it took you a while to wrap your head around the RPG parts, if you knew how to play Bejeweled, you could get by until the rest came into focus. Galactrix tries something a little more unique, creating a style of puzzle action that fuses Bejeweled with <a data-ref-id=\"3025-304\" href=\"/hexic/3025-304/\" slug=\"hexic\">Hexic</a>. I suppose Infinite Interactive should get credit for trying something new, but it handicaps the accessibility.\u00a0You're still swapping gems around, trying to line up three or more like-colored gems in a row to clear them out. But now the gems themselves are six-sided, making it possible to line them up vertically or diagonally, and instead of having new gems always drop into the field from above, they'll often come in from whichever direction you moved the gems in.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>There are more gem colors to contend with now, though it's less the number and more the way they're implemented that gums up the works. In addition to the mine gems, which throw damage at your enemy, red, yellow, and green gems fill up the power gauges you'll need to perform any special abilities you have equipped; blue gems fill up your shield, which prevents your enemy from draining your hit points directly; gray gems increase the amount of XP you earn from winning a fight; and purple gems add to your \u201cpsi power,\u201d which you can use to avoid random enemy encounters.\u00a0With so many variables, the learning curve is longer, and the puzzle action feels far more chaotic. One of the complaints about Puzzle Quest was the perception that your AI opponents cheated, and while developer Infinite Interactive has sworn up and down that there was no programming in Puzzle Quest that should give the AI any kind of foresight beyond what's on the table, Galactrix isn't going to do anything to quell those complaints.</div><div><br/></div><div>Outside of the puzzle action there are even more systems to contend with, such as a faction system that impacts who will attack you and who you can trade with, and a byzantine leapgate map system.\u00a0Infinite Interactive seems to have lost sight of the approachability that made Puzzle Quest endearing, and Galactrix is simply more demanding than it should be. The first Puzzle Quest was a revelation; Galactrix is just a complication.</div>", "deck": "It's not technically inferior, but Galactrix just doesn't excite in the same way as Puzzle Quest did.

But by designing the action with a greater focus on driving than on walking and shooting, this vehicular Vin Diesel vehicle feels different enough to separate itself from the games it resembles. By giving you some pretty clever moves to pull off while you drive, Wheelman makes its high-speed chases thrilling in a way that most games don't match.<br/><br/> The story of Wheelman has you, as <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89663\" href=\"/vin-diesel/3040-89663/\" slug=\"vin-diesel\"> Vin Diesel</a> playing an undercover agent going by the name  Milo Burik, playing the gangs of  Barcelona against each other. As a man in the middle, you'll do a lot of driving-related work for the various factions of the city. But your real goal is to get in on a caper that's being planned outside of the gangs' purview. The game's story bounces around from faction to faction so frequently that it's a little hard to follow, and your overarching goal only pops up at the very beginning and near the very end of the game. So few of the game's missions feel meaningful, in a storyline sense. But as a setup to just bomb around the city in a fast-moving car, the quick cutscenes that bookend each mission work well enough.<br/><br/> It shouldn't shock you that the best part about Wheelman is its driving. The cars are very loose and squirrelly, allowing you to drift around turns without losing much speed, spin around quickly to throw off your rivals, and generally navigate through traffic. While you can fire a weapon and drive at the same time, the car itself is probably the most exciting weapon in the game. By pushing the right analog stick around, you can force the car to lunge left, right, or forward. This is an attack that bashes the cars around you, doing damage and ultimately setting them up for takedowns. The lunges are extremely exaggerated and totally unrealistic... which is part of why they're so much fun. You also have an on-screen focus meter that can be used for turbo boosts or for aimed shots that slow the action down and place specific targets on enemy vehicles that, when shot, cause that vehicle to blow up immediately. You can do this aimed shot on cars in front of you, or you can opt for the \"cyclone,\" which spins your car around to take out the guys behind you, then spins it again when it's over. It's as ridiculous as it sounds, and it looks pretty cool, too. But the ridiculous style quotient is fully met by the game's \"airjack\" maneuver. By driving behind another vehicle and timing the release of a button, you can leap out of your existing car and steal a new one, all without really slowing down. It's both awesome and useful. Replacing a damaged car with a new one all without really exposing yourself to the enemies who are usually shooting up your car almost feels unfair at times.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920492-wheelman_screens_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-920492\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66118421052632\" data-width=\"608\" style=\"width: 608px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/920492-wheelman_screens_08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-920492\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/920492-wheelman_screens_08.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The cars in Wheelman bash up pretty nicely.</figcaption></figure>The mission structure in Wheelman is tightly focused. You don't need to aimlessly drive around the city or work your way from one point to another just to start missions. You can fire up a story mission from your map. You don't even need to go and get a fast car, because the story missions all provide vehicles for you to use. Side missions are a different story. While you can start any of these up from the map, as well, you'll need to be in a car to start them. These missions have you trying to get away from rival gangs, picking up packages on a tight time limit, taxiing people around, or stealing specific vehicles and delivering them without damage. The side stuff isn't fantastic, but doing well in these missions has the benefit of increasing the amount of damage your vehicles can take, increasing the size of your focus meter, and other similar power-ups. I managed to finish the game's main story without doing most of the side missions, though, so they don't feel especially necessary unless you're having trouble completing a given mission or playing the game like a completist.<br/><br/> During some missions, you'll need to get out of your car and do some shooting. The game's on-foot sections work well enough to keep things moving. Lock-on targeting makes gunning down opponents easy, and there are always plenty of objects lying around to hide behind. Milo's health regenerates quickly, so as long as you're a little careful, it's tough to fail a mission by dying. Even in cases where you fail, the game checkpoints its missions fairly tightly, so you won't need to recover a lot of ground when you mess up.<br/><br/> Visually, the city of Barcelona and the cars in it look fine. Bashing cars around and causing them to explode also looks good. The only real visual issue with the game comes in its cutscenes. The characters look like they have a weird coat of plastic over their faces, and the facial animation isn't so hot. A lot of the up-close bits just look really strange. That said, it's already sort of hard to take the cutscenes seriously. Vin Diesel's dialogue consists of brief, one-or-two-line responses to the various gang leaders you're taking missions from. Whether you take that as an example of his character's \"quiet strength\" or as a issue with Diesel's range is entirely up to you. I will say that between playing Wheelman, seeing the new  <i>Fast &amp; Furious</i> movie, and playing a bit of the new <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20987\" href=\"/the-chronicles-of-riddick-assault-on-dark-athena/3030-20987/\" slug=\"the-chronicles-of-riddick-assault-on-dark-athena\"> Riddick</a> re-release, I've noticed that the dialogue format for Diesel's work is all incredibly similar--a few lines of dialogue, usually said in a gruff, low tone that seems like it's meant to paint his characters as bad-asses that don't need to yell very often to make their point. Again, you probably already know if you love or hate that style.<br/><br/> Wheelman, in a lot of ways, makes for a great spot of relatively mindless fun. It's tightly focused on the driving, and it gets that stuff right, making for an exciting romp through the streets of Barcelona. But you spend just enough time out of the car or playing through uninspired side missions to prevent Wheelman from scratching the same obsessive itch hit by other, better open-world crime-themed games. It's certainly mechanically sound, but you should probably attempt to find it at a slight discount.", "deck": "Wheelman has some great ideas that are executed well, but a lot of the peripheral stuff is underwhelming.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-140/", "platforms": "PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20698/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wheelman/3030-20698/", "id": 20698, "name": "Wheelman"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-04-13 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-81571/", "id": 81571, "name": " Wheelman"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-godfather-ii-review/1900-141/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33532/951156-the_godfather_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-951156\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55753968253968\" data-width=\"504\" style=\"width: 504px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33532/951156-the_godfather_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-951156\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33532/951156-the_godfather_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The voice you hear doesn't quite match the face you see.</figcaption></figure>The first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13540\" href=\"/the-godfather-the-game/3030-13540/\" slug=\"the-godfather-the-game\">Godfather</a> game was a bit of a conundrum. Here's a game that carries the pedigree of arguably the most significant and influential piece of crime fiction of the 20th century and features the voices of several of its most prominent actors, yet the end result didn't feel like much more than a mostly competent <span><a data-ref-id=\"3025-6\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a></span> also-ran. EA takes another approach with The Godfather II, which treats the source material with markedly less reverence, but it tweaks the gameplay to focus more on heading up your own <span>Cosa Nostra</span> with results that at least feel unique. It's an interesting ride for a while, even if it brims with creative choices that are all but guaranteed to upset Godfather fans. The sense of strategy it initially presents eventually wears thin, and the game runs out of meaningful content before it's over.</div><div><br/></div><div>Like the first game, The Godfather II puts you in the role of a new character that has been written into the existing Godfather narrative. As Dominic, an underboss in the Corleone family who gets promoted to Don of New York by <span><a data-ref-id=\"3005-3072\" href=\"/michael-corleone/3005-3072/\" slug=\"michael-corleone\">Michael Corleone</a></span> himself at the start of the game, you will ride shotgun on several key events from the 1958 portion of <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">The Godfather Part II</span>, including the attempted murder of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9242\" href=\"/frank-pentangeli/3005-9242/\" slug=\"frank-pentangeli\">Frank Pentangeli</a>, <span><span>Senator Geary</span></span>'s brothel \u201caccident,\u201d and the manipulations of\u00a0<span><span><span><span>Hyman Roth</span></span></span></span> and <span>Fredo Corleone</span>. EA made a pretty big deal of the fact that\u00a0original cast members and general cinematic heavy-hitters like <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89954\" href=\"/marlon-brando/3040-89954/\" slug=\"marlon-brando\">Marlon Brando</a>, <span>Robert Duvall</span>, <span>James Caan</span>, and <span>Abe Vigod</span>a reprised their roles from the film for the first Godfather game. It was a move that, at least on paper if not always in practice, furthered the sense that this was an authentic Godfather experience. In The Godfather II, Robert Duvall is the sole returning cast member, and playing against a cast of video-game voice actors, he sounds old and out of place.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>The story-driven parts of the game are dwarfed in terms of both impact and volume by the crime-boss elements. Your ultimate goal in the game is to take over all of the rackets and kill off all of the other families, and you'll spend a lot of your time in the game working towards that goal pretty directly. You start off in <span><a data-ref-id=\"3035-109\" href=\"/new-york/3035-109/\" slug=\"new-york\">New York</a></span>, eventually expanding to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1324\" href=\"/florida/3035-1324/\" slug=\"florida\">Florida</a> and <span><a data-ref-id=\"3035-1286\" href=\"/cuba/3035-1286/\" slug=\"cuba\">Cuba</a></span>, and the rackets range from sex trade to drug trafficking. When you're on the ground, the game handles a lot like GTA, though with more well-developed hand-to-hand combat. When you pause the game you're shown the \u201cDon's View,\u201d which lets you see all of the different rackets, as well as which families are running them, and how many guards there are at each location. Once you've figured out which racket you want to take, you head to that location, kill all the guards, and shake down the proprietor.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4656/941589-41791_orig.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941589\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4656/941589-41791_orig.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941589\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4656/941589-41791_orig.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The world is yours.</figcaption></figure>Of course, since you're the Don, you won't have to do all of the heavy lifting by yourself, which is what your made men are for. Up to three made men can roll around with you in a crew, or you can send them off to bomb or attempt to take over other rackets, or protect your own interests. As a new Don, you start the game with only a single made man. As your business grows, so does your family, and eventually you'll have a small army of made men at your command.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>You'll actually handpick all of your made men, which is a fairly important process, as each made man starts with a specific skill that will come in handy as you take over rackets. They can be arsonists, safecrackers, demolitionists, engineers, bruisers, and medics. The buildings that the rackets are contained in are always very deliberately laid out in such a way that, if you have a made man with a specific skill in your crew, you'll have an easier time taking it. As your family expands, you can promote made men to capos and capos to underbosses, and every time you promote a made man, you can select an additional skill for them, making them more versatile crew members.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>Once you take over a racket, you'll start earning money from it on a daily basis. If you want to keep that racket, you'll need to assign guards to protect it from attacks by other families. Guards cost money, creating a simple check-and-balance system, though it would've been more effective if you used money in the game for more than just upgrading your stats and those of your family members. Take over all of the rackets in a crime ring, though, and you'll get a tangible gameplay bonus, like brass knuckles, extended weapon clips, or bulletproof cars.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/561014-crew.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-561014\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/561014-crew.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-561014\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/561014-crew.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/561014-crew.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A Don is only as strong as his crew.</figcaption></figure>There are some side activities you can get into, such as robbing banks or doing criminal favors for for various people, but it all eventually comes back to the rackets. In its first half, I found the game to be quite engaging. There's a ton of stuff going on, but the game introduces new elements at a reasonable pace, and a character will usually spells out how they work and what they mean to you quite clearly, oftentimes at the expense of more realistic dialog. I had fun figuring out the best way to allocate guards, which rackets were of most strategic value to me, and who I should promote within my family. It's not overwhelming, but it kept me engaged, at least up to a point.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>Once I figured that stuff out, though, the game turned into a grind to the finish. The people I talked to would repeat the same dialog, and there were roughly one-and-a-half different voices for anyone who wasn't in a cutscene. I started noticing that the rackets basically came in four different shapes. This made it feel like I was taking over the same rackets over and over again, a feeling that made the already bite-sized city locations seem that much smaller. The game also features a online multiplayer mode, which is theoretically quite interesting, since you can earn upgrades for the types of weapons your made men can use through it.

Tales of Valor instead chooses to focus on small game-refinement changes and three new multiplayer modes. The game also includes a bevy of new multiplayer maps and the ability to have direct fire control over your units, of which there are several new ones to choose from. While these additions are nice, they likely won't do much for those looking for robust single-player action. What's there, though, is thrilling stuff and up to the quality standards of the original game, if presented in a slightly different format.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/944863-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944863\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/944863-02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944863\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/944863-02.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Tank combat is the focus of the first mini-campaign.</figcaption></figure>Tales of Valor comes packaged with three mini-campaigns that, while fun, are extremely brief and play radically differently from the large mega-campaigns found in the original game and its first expansion Opposing Fronts. Each mini-campaign is comprised of three missions each giving you very little time to get attached to the history and story behind the action. Although there's the same use of stylized moving-painting productions in the cut-scenes it doesn't do much for those wanting a continuation of the epic story-arcs from the main campaign. Still, the action here is excellent and the more scripted sequences, especially those involving the defense of the game's many bridges, are very fun. The three campaigns took me about six hours to complete, which was extended due to several crashes on the final mission.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>The gameplay in these mini-campaigns also differs from the source material in that you're focusing on small amounts of units in a more scripted game world. While that kind of combat became a hallmark for the original, it seems overly pronounced in this offering. For example, in the the three missions of the first campaign, you'll play as a single German tank crew. No base, no paratroopers, just that one bad-ass tank with its massively powerful two-second reload time. While narrowing the sight makes for a fast ride, these missions are definitely a radical departure for the series. In fact, the heightened focus on small tactics feels more similar to the gameplay found in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21175\" href=\"/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii/3030-21175/\" slug=\"warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-ii\">Dawn of War II</a>, Relic's last game, than the original Company of Heroes. Compounded with the short play-time, it's a move that veteran COH players will likely be disappointed in.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/944862-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944862\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54375\" data-width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/944862-01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944862\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/944862-01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Tales uses the same painted cut-scenes of the original.</figcaption></figure>On the multiplayer front, Tales of Valor adds three new modes of play: Panzerkrieg, Stonewall and Assault. Panzerkrieg puts you in control of a single tank while your team attempts take over the various control points, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-51\" href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" slug=\"battlefield\">Battlefield</a>-style. The action is quick, and though your tank will respawn after each death, the focus here is on attacking as a group. The Assault mode is a carbon copy of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12567\" href=\"/warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos/3030-12567/\" slug=\"warcraft-iii-reign-of-chaos\">Warcraft III</a> mod <span><a href=\"http://www.dota-allstars.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Defense of the Ancients</a></span>. It plays with a similar single-unit focus, as you control a solitary hero unit as you and your team attack a mirrored base of human opponents. Essentially, a stream of AI-controlled units battle it out over the middle ground and your individual actions as a commander, medic, sniper or other hero class turns the tide and helps those troops make it through the enemy defenses. The last mode, Stonewall, has your team of human-controlled opponents fending off waves of AI-controlled units who try to attack your central base.</div><div><br/></div><div>These multiplayer modes are nice as additions to the main multiplayer component of the game, but likely will be short distractions from the more traditional multiplayer modes from the original game. Luckily there are also some new maps included for those modes as well, and Company of Heroes continues to be a very popular RTS online.</div><div><br/></div><div>Overall it's the game's $30 price tag at the time of this writing that stops me from fully recommending Tales of Valor. Considering that the original COH plus Opposing Fronts can be bought around the same price these days, I'd definitely point new recruits to those excellent titles before they look at the new expansion as a stand-alone product. For experienced players, though, Tales of Valor offers enough distractions to fill your need for something new. Just don't be surprised if you find yourself returning to the original campaign and multiplayer modes the next time you need a fix.</div>", "deck": "Though the action is solid while it lasts, Tales of Valor's short campaign and additional multiplayer modes don't justify the standalone price tag.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-142/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24362/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/company-of-heroes-tales-of-valor/3030-24362/", "id": 24362, "name": "Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-04-16 11:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82162/", "id": 82162, "name": "Company of Heroes: Tales of Valor"}, "reviewer": "Dave"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/lode-runner-review/1900-143/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/925116-loadrunnerxbla_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925116\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/925116-loadrunnerxbla_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925116\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/925116-loadrunnerxbla_3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>In the ice levels, your enemies are yetis.</figcaption></figure>Can you put 25th Anniversary artwork on your game's title screen if it's 26 years old? This is the bold statement that Lode Runner on Xbox Live Arcade asks us to consider. This classic <a data-ref-id=\"3025-479\" href=\"/lode-runner/3025-479/\" slug=\"lode-runner\">franchise</a> that got its <a data-ref-id=\"3030-636\" href=\"/lode-runner/3030-636/\" slug=\"lode-runner\">start</a> in 1983 on machines like the Apple II and Atari 400/800 doesn't really get as much respect as it probably deserves. It was huge on those computers, and then somehow went on to become big in Japan, too, spawning weird remakes for the Famicom and PC Engine, and even an arcade release. Since then, it's made various appearances on more modern machines with varying levels of faithfulness to the original game's design. For 2009, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6603\" href=\"/tozai-games/3010-6603/\" slug=\"tozai-games\">Tozai Games</a> and Southend Interactive have produced a game that doesn't recall any of the original game's look, but pulls off the gameplay well enough while adding a few modes in the process. It doesn't really work as a nostalgia piece, but the classic gameplay still makes for a quality mix of action and puzzle.<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>In Lode Runner, your goal is to clear out all of the gold from a level by running around and collecting it. Enemies are also running around the level, and they use basic, exploitable AI patterns to follow you around. They'll also pick up gold and carry it around with them. Your weapon is also the main tool you use to get around the levels--a gun that blasts away blocks, letting you fall through them to get to lower levels. You can also trap enemies in the holes you dig, giving you a brief respite from their advance until they either climb out of the hole or it fills in, which kills the enemy and immediately spawns a new one. The challenge comes from outrunning your foes while carefully digging and climbing your way around a level, taking care to not trap yourself in holes along the way. When you've collected all the gold, an exit appears, letting you move on.</div><div><br/></div><div>This is one of those deviously simple designs that doesn't sound like much, but the formula is rock solid, forcing you to think on your feet and, above all, keep moving. For the most part, this new version of Lode Runner sticks to the same script that <a data-ref-id=\"3040-5116\" href=\"/douglas-e-smith/3040-5116/\" slug=\"douglas-e-smith\">Douglas E. Smith</a> penned when he created the game in the first place, but there are some new additions. The game goes through several visual motifs as you play, so you'll get a set of levels based in ruins, volcanic levels, ice levels, and so on. Special blocks appear in each set, like avalanche blocks that all disappear if you blast just one, or blocks with stalactites hanging from them that drill blocks or eliminate enemies if you cause the spiky rocks to fall. Some later levels also have bombs in them. You can collect bombs and drop them around the map, which causes a section of blocks to all disappear at once. Of course, anything that gets destroyed eventually fills in, just like it would if you had dug it with your blaster. These changes stray from the original formula, so as a purist I'm forced to tell you that I hate them. But, honestly, they do add some decent variety to the game by giving you one more thing to consider while you play.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/925121-loadrunnerxbla_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925121\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/925121-loadrunnerxbla_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-925121\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/925121-loadrunnerxbla_8.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The game looks fine, but I wish there was some kind of \"retro graphics\" option.</figcaption></figure>The main mode is called Journey, and this takes you through sets of levels with limited lives and a score. If you lose all your lives, you can restart from the last level you reached, so you won't lose any real progress if you find yourself struggling with a tough level. There are also additional modes. Hang On is a survival-style mode that gives you a big level with lots of gold. As you collect gold, more enemies spawn into the level, making it harder and harder to survive as time goes on. The amount of gold you can collect before getting caught determines your score. Puzzle mode doesn't have enemies, but instead puts you in tricky situations that require you to think before you move. There are 50 puzzle levels, and they get pretty tough.</div><div><br/></div><div>One of the great things about the original Lode Runner was that it came with a level editor, giving you the ability to create things just as simple or as complicated as the levels that came with the game. This remake comes with an editor, as well, letting you create levels in any of the different visual styles for any of the game's modes. The editor is fairly simple to use, and you can share levels with other players. However, the game doesn't have a central map server, so to share levels, you have to create a \"map lobby\" and sit there while other players join, download your levels, and leave. It's a clunky solution to what is apparently a tough development issue on Xbox Live Arcade, but at a price of $15, this game should have a centralized place to download user-created levels.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game also has multiplayer, both online and off. The multiplayer spans some of the same modes, so there are co-op specific levels for journey and puzzle. This is a cool addition and the levels are designed in a way that actually forces players to cooperate, rather than just letting two players take on the single-player levels. There's also a mode called Last Man that is competitive. It's a survival mode, where the goal is to be alive the longest. It's a neat idea, but it's a little abrupt and sometimes what's going on feels a little unclear.</div><div><br/></div><div>Visually, the game looks like most other Xbox Live Arcade games, which is to say that it sort of looks like a budget PC game. It's decent, but nothing that's going to make you sit up and take notice. It's probably worth mentioning that the camera tilts around a bit as you run or climb from one side of a level to the other, which I found to be pretty annoying. The sound effects are standard and some of the music started to grate on me as I played.</div><div><br/></div><div>While I'll always have a fond place in my heart for the original version of Lode Runner and the way it looks and sounds, this is a strong reinterpretation of the original game that pulls off the same tricky balancing act between thinking and running. The only thing that gives me pause is the price. $15 is a lot for an Xbox Live Arcade game, but Lode Runner has enough levels across its different modes to feel like you're getting a good amount of content for the money.</div>", "deck": "Lode Runner maintains the classic gameplay of its predecessors, adds a few new ways to play, and gives you plenty of levels to work through.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-143/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25524/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/lode-runner/3030-25524/", "id": 25524, "name": "Lode Runner"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-04-22 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83189/", "id": 83189, "name": "Lode Runner"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/excitebots-trick-racing-review/1900-144/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/953811-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-953811\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.566\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/953811-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-953811\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7423/953811-5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Wait. Why does that ladybug have a giant hammer?</figcaption></figure>I'll confess that I didn't come into <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25438\" href=\"/excitebots-trick-racing/3030-25438/\" slug=\"excitebots-trick-racing\"> Excitebots: Trick Racing</a> with particularly high expectations. This is largely because its predecessor,  <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13645\" href=\"/excite-truck/3030-13645/\" slug=\"excite-truck\"> Excite Truck</a>, struck me as pretty half-assed, both in its arcade-racing execution and its feebly manufactured connection to the classic  <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15025\" href=\"/excitebike/3030-15025/\" slug=\"excitebike\"> Excitebike</a>. You can see many of the ideas from Truck at work in Bots, some of them copied verbatim, but the rest of the game has been built up with an unhindered enthusiasm for high-speed chaos and a stance towards physics and reality in general that borders on contempt. It's a sugar-rush of a racing game, one that spends as much energy trying to distract you from the race as it does demanding that you give it all of your attention.<br/><br/> Like Excite Truck, Excitebots is an arcade-style racing game with a focus on big jumps and lots of speed. The basic control profile is almost identical, with you holding the Wii Remote sideways, tilting it to steer. Excitebots also touts support for the Wii Steering Wheel, and you can buy the game bundled with the wheel, though the net effect is that you're tilting the remote in a  <i>slightly</i> different way. The core handling is kind of mushy, but the track designs tend towards lots of straightaways and multitiered jumps, and they rarely feature serpentine turns that demand much more precision than what is offered. In a way, the handling actually magnifies the sensation that you are perpetually on the verge of going completely out of control--a sensation that I find elusive, but immensely satisfying.<br/><br/> It helps that, amongst the things you need to concern yourself with during a race, the actual racing isn't always at the top of the list. \u00a0Regardless of which mode you're playing in Excitebots, stars are the metric by which success is determined. You'll earn some stars for finishing a race in a top position, but you'll get more for catching massive air, performing aerial tricks, drifting around corners, and slamming into other racers over the course of a race. The game will even toss you a star when you crash. The best way to earn stars, though, is by successfully activating the totally insane triggers that litter the tracks.\u00a0<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/924658-excitebots1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-924658\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.46277915632754\" data-width=\"806\" style=\"width: 806px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:46.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/924658-excitebots1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-924658\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/924658-excitebots1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Not even giant mechanical grasshoppers can resist the siren call of the SUPER SANDWICH.</figcaption></figure>As in Excite Truck, you'll find triggers on the track that will change the shape of the course in front of you, usually for the purpose of creating a big-ass ramp where there previously wasn't one. This is, far and away, the tamest of the triggers in Excitebots. Many are sports-themed, requiring you knock over giant bowling pins or knock a giant soccer ball into a goal. Some are just crazy, requiring you to throw a pie at a giant, floating clown face, or construct a fabled \u201csuper sandwich\u201d while attached to a grind rail. Tracks are also littered with glowing bars that you can swing around by moving the Wii Remote in a specific way, building up momentum to ultimately send you flying through the air with great vigor.<br/><br/> Now, if I haven't yet made this clear, the vehicles that you're driving in Excitebots are transforming-car robots that look like animals. It's mostly insects, but there are creatures like a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1688\" href=\"/bats/3015-1688/\" slug=\"bats\"> bat</a>, a  mouse, and a turtle in the mix as well. I can't make much sense out of the reasoning behind the animal theme, but the fact that they're robots is material to the gameplay.\u00a0You'll find wrench icons on specific sections of track, which will transform your car-bot into a leg-bot for a short stretch. It requires you to rock the remote back and forth to create speed, which makes steering even harder, though the upside is that you can move at incredible speeds, plowing through otherwise impenetrable obstacles.\u00a0<br/><br/> If I have a complaint about Excitebots, it's that there doesn't seem to be a huge number of tracks in the game. The standard race mode consists of five different cups, and by the time you hit the third cup, you've seen just about all of them. It's less of an issue than it might seem, since the way bars and triggers are distributed can have a profound effect on how a track plays.<br/><br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/941074-exciteb08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941074\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56533333333333\" data-width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/941074-exciteb08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941074\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/941074-exciteb08.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/941074-exciteb08.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Go all in!</figcaption></figure>Once you play through the first set of races in the excite mode, you gain access to the rest of Excitebots' goodies. Top of the list is poker race, which is almost exactly what it sounds like. You're competing in a race on a standard track, but you're also trying to make five-card poker hands by picking up giant cards on the track. Different types of hands will net you varying amounts of stars, though if you end up with five cards you don't like, you can use the D-pad to select one of them, allowing you to replace it with the next card you collect. There's a real pat-your-head-and-rub-your-belly challenge to making poker hands while hurtling across a dirty racetrack, which is kind of a definining characteristic of Excitebots in general. It's certainly true of the minigames, which put the spotlight on the goofy triggers and contraptions you happen upon during regular races.\u00a0<br/><br/><br/> The online mode in Excitebots is pretty to-the-point, allowing you to jump into either a standard race or a poker race with randoms, or trade Excitebots-specific codes to play with your buddies. It's the very definition of irony that the way the whole friend code system has been implemented actually makes it profoundly more difficult to play with your friends than strangers, though to its credit, Excitebots allows you to send specific performance challenges and replays to folks who are on your general Wii friends list. What makes the online in Excitebots of particular interest to me is the way it will let you wager stars you've earned in other modes on an online race. Stars are basically currency in Excitebots, so the ability to lose them all or double your money based on your performance really heightens the risk/reward online.<br/><br/> As time passes, it gets harder and harder to find games that can actually offer a surprise, so I found the ways in which Excitebots managed to catch me off-guard to be quite pleasing.

Most of those ideas are taken from <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defense_of_the_Ancients\" rel=\"nofollow\">Defense of the Ancients</a>, the free <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14073\" href=\"/warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne/3030-14073/\" slug=\"warcraft-iii-the-frozen-throne\">Warcraft III</a> mod whose gameplay blueprint Demigod lifts almost entirely. But this is the video game industry; if we condemned every game that was a lot like other good games, we'd never play anything new. This strategy action title adds a few minor, interesting ideas to the DOTA formula, but unfortunate technical issues with the online multiplayer keep it from being as enjoyable as it would be if it played smoothly.</div><div><br/></div><div>Like DOTA, Demigod looks like a real-time strategy game, though apart from the overhead camera angle, it only shares a few similarities with that genre. It's a team-based game where players on each side choose one of eight heroes, each with unique strengths and special abilities, and then fight it out with each other on a symmetrical map while attempting to bust through the opposition's defenses and smash up its base. All the while, AI-controlled fodder units are spawning in your base and running preset paths across the map, where they battle with identical enemy fodder.</div><div><br/></div><div>In short, the general flow of the game has you and your teammates leveling up by fighting the smaller troops, unlocking new abilities and buying upgrade items, and getting into quick, intense fights with the other team's player-controlled heroes. Even the strongest hero characters can die pretty quickly, so death is a constant threat and you have to be quick on your abilities and movements to stay alive and keep leveling up as fast as your opponents are.</div><div><br/></div><div>Developer\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3010-1579\" href=\"/gas-powered-games/3010-1579/\" slug=\"gas-powered-games\">Gas Powered Games</a> expands on the general DOTA framework in a few neat ways. All of the game's maps have flags strewn across them that confer bonuses when you capture them like extra experience, shorter ability cooldown times, or increased armor for your fodder troops. So there's some incentive in covering the map evenly to keep as many of these flags in your possession as possible. And in addition to individual items you can buy with the gold you earn, you can also purchase team upgrades that do things like hasten your leveling speed, reduce the timeout death penalty, and add stronger units to your fodder troop waves. I wish you could purchase these team upgrades with some kind of collective currency instead of your own personal gold, though. Very few players I met online were willing to spend their gold to help out the team, and when I blew all my money on those upgrades, I rarely had any left over to buff up my own hero.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/854953-demigod2009_01_0619_40_01_55.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-854953\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/854953-demigod2009_01_0619_40_01_55.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-854953\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/854953-demigod2009_01_0619_40_01_55.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are a lot of items and abilities to tweak out your hero with.</figcaption></figure>There are only eight heroes here compared to the dozens in DOTA, but at least there's some decent variety among them. Four of them are assassins--direct damage-dealers with stronger, targeted attacks--and the other four are generals--heroes who can spawn a variety of additional weak minions into the fray. The different heroes collectively cover all the bases of ranged and melee attacks, damage-per-second machines, tanks, healers, support classes... If all this sounds a lot like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\" href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" slug=\"world-of-warcraft\">World of Warcraft</a>, it should. This sort of game is a little like an MMO in microcosm, since you level up every couple of minutes instead of every couple of days. But the pursuit of better powers and items has the same carrot-on-a-stick feel to it.</div><div><br/></div><div>Most of the characters are pretty standard fantasy-shlock fare; there's a knight, a foul beast, a girl riding a big cat, a wizard, a scantily clad demon chick, and so on. Nothing too exciting from a design standpoint. But I have to give a shout out to whoever designed my homeboy <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10405\" href=\"/the-rook/3005-10405/\" slug=\"the-rook\">the Rook</a>, who is none other than a gigantic lumbering <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">castle</span>. His abilities are just as extreme as his stature--he can do things like add archers and turrets onto his shoulders, and suck up enemy buildings brick by brick to simultaneously destroy them and regain his own health. I wish all the characters were that ridiculous and awesome.</div><div><br/></div><div>Demigod is literally all about competitive action. There's no single-player campaign to speak of; you can only play one-off skirmish matches or a ranked tournament series against the AI. Online, you can do skirmishes of up to five against five players and a more structured, elaborate tournament called the Pantheon. Squaring off against AI bots is fun enough while you're still learning the game, but you can only play against the computer for so long before you'll want to go online and find a real challenge.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/880390-00295336.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-880390\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56210526315789\" data-width=\"950\" style=\"width: 950px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/880390-00295336.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-880390\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/880390-00295336.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/880390-00295336.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>DUDE THAT CASTLE IS WALKING WHAT THE HELLS</figcaption></figure>That lack of a more involved story-driven offline component really hurts Demigod, since so far the online play has been wildly inconsistent. Publisher <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1064\" href=\"/stardock-corporation/3010-1064/\" slug=\"stardock-corporation\">Stardock</a> overcame the initial problems with the game's early retail release that were literally preventing anyone from playing the game, but even a week after the official release date, getting into a game that's free of laggy stuttering is a dicey proposition. Even getting into the pre-game lobby can take way too long, leaving you staring at a \"Connecting\" window for a couple of minutes, only to be disconnected from a \"NAT facilitator\" or other arcane error message.</div><div><br/></div><div>Moreover, the smoothness of the online gameplay seems to depend on the quality of every player's connection. If one person has a high ping or starts lagging badly, it bogs down the match for everyone involved. I experienced this game-wide lag in a number of online matches, and trust me, the other players were not shy about voicing their mutual displeasure. At its least, it's a mild annoyance, but at its worst, it turns the game into an unplayable slide show. To be fair, I got into some lobbies in a matter of seconds, and had some games that ran smoothly and were quite playable, but those instances were in the minority. It's a shame you have to work so hard to find good matches.</div><div><br/></div><div>Demigod can be a lot of fun online when it works right, when the gameplay is smooth and you're working with your teammates efficiently to buff up your defenses, take the right flags, and chase down and slaughter the enemy heroes with a one-two punch of special abilities. It's just a shame that experience is so hard to come by right now. When--or if--Stardock and Gas Powered get all these issues fully ironed out, Demigod will be easier to recommend, but for now you should be aware of exactly what you're getting into.</div><div><br/></div>", "deck": "This competitive-only strategy action game has some good ideas that are hindered by its laggy, inconsistent online play.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-145/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21233/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/demigod/3030-21233/", "id": 21233, "name": "Demigod"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-04-22 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-77612/", "id": 77612, "name": "Demigod"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/ninja-blade-review/1900-146/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/856923-os8q5u.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-856923\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/856923-os8q5u.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-856923\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/856923-os8q5u.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Upgrading your swords makes them more effective, and gives you a few new moves, too.</figcaption></figure>If it weren't for the graphics and the scope of its action, you could be excused for thinking that Ninja Blade was an early PlayStation 2 game. It's an action game that feels like it was designed somewhere around the turn of the century, ignoring modern conventions in a way that almost seems stand-offish, like it's daring you to enjoy it. For those who wade through the game's dull battles and extreme focus on sometimes-harsh boss fights, you'll be rewarded by a stream of cinematic chaos in the form of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\"> Quick Time Event</a> cutscenes that depict your ninja doing things you simply wouldn't expect. But when the best thing you can say about a game is that its interactive cutscenes might occasionally make you chuckle because they're often out-of-hand, you can bet that the rest of the game is sort of a mess.<br/><br/> Ninja Blade puts you in the role of a ninja named Ken. You're part of some secret governmental task force and your goal is to save  Tokyo from \"alpha-worms.\" These worms are infecting everything around you, turning people into monsters, and turning animals into... well, more monsters. You're somehow immune to infection, giving you free reign over the city as you hack apart carriers on your way from one boss fight to the next.<br/><br/> You're armed with a few different weapons and a few types of magic that you can toss out on a big, plate-sized shuriken. The combo system is fairly basic, though you'll unlock more moves as you upgrade your weapons. Weapons and magic are upgraded by spending the red orbs that launch out of every enemy after they're defeated. Defeating the standard enemies isn't much of a chore, and there aren't very many different varieties to keep things fresh. You'll occasionally run into enemies with shields that require a swipe from your heavier sword, which cracks the shield. Sometimes you'll see a swarm of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1688\" href=\"/bats/3015-1688/\" slug=\"bats\"> bats</a> heading your way, requiring you to swap to your faster twin blades, which extend and whip around, giving you a good ranged attack to clear out the bats before they even get close. But the game isn't really about the average enemies or its run-of-the-mill combat. It's about big, pattern-based boss fights that are surrounded by interactive cutscenes that force you to time a few select button presses to keep the action moving forward.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4387/628960-medium_nb_moto2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-628960\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56066945606695\" data-width=\"478\" style=\"width: 478px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4387/628960-medium_nb_moto2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-628960\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4387/628960-medium_nb_moto2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Riding bikes while falling out of the sky? That's how I hope to go someday.</figcaption></figure>The \"animals getting infected\" part of the story is what gives you your boss fights. You'll find giant snails, huge worms, sizable spiders, a giant enemy crab, and so on. The bosses rotate through a few basic patterns of attack, leaving themselves open to counterattack at various times. You'll often need to soften them up with your heavy sword first, as it can crack through the armor surrounding your targets' fleshy bits. Most of the game's levels are about these boss fights--even if you're not actively engaging a big guy, you're probably chasing him down. Along the way, as well as during and after the big fights, you'll get dropped into a ton of Quick Time Events. It feels like around a third of the seven hours I spent completing Ninja Blade was spent going through QTEs. If that makes this game sound boring to you, you're right, it's not much fun. But it's also not quite as bad as it sounds.<br/><br/> The one thing Ninja Blade has going for it is that those cinematic cutscenes often show Ken doing something pretty wild. At the end of the second mission, you'll watch him ride a motorcycle along the side of a bus... which happens to be falling out of the sky after being puked up by the enemy boss. Ken rides his way down the pile of cars and debris, then flips off the motorcycle and flings it into a tanker truck near the bad guy's mouth... and then everything explodes. These scenes almost act as a consolation prize, like they're saying \"hey, we know the game isn't any fun, but the  <i>least</i> we can do is give you something sort of crazy to watch.\" It saves Ninja Blade from being a complete failure, but that doesn't make it much easier to recommend.<br/><br/> The focus on occasionally tough boss fight patterns and cutscenes goes a long way in making Ninja Blade feel old. That's compounded by the game's inflexible save system, which only lets you start a session at the beginning of a mission, not in the middle. If you die, you'll restart at a checkpoint, but if you decide you have something better to do and come back later, you'll have to begin the entire mission again. Also, any orbs you earn or powers you upgrade are reset if you don't reach the next checkpoint before dying. You may consider those to be little issues--they certainly don't break the game or anything--but they all kind of add up to around 2000 or 2001. Saving your progress at checkpoints, at least, has to be considered standard in this day and age, right?<br/><br/> It's great that Ninja Blade has its wide collection of big, hairy bosses. And it's cool that it doesn't stick so close to the \"ninja\" blueprint, occasionally putting you behind the turret of a heavy machine gun for a rail-shooting sequence or showing you riding a motorcycle during cutscenes. But it isn't hard enough to be attractive to players who fiend for a challenge, it isn't flashy enough to appeal to graphics enthusiasts, and the gameplay isn't good enough to distinguish it from the pack. If the thought of seeing a ninja fighting a giant hydra while standing on the wing of burning jet sounds awesome to you (which, to be honest, should sound awesome to anyone), and you're prepared to deal with some funky issues and some boring combat, look for Ninja Blade... after it's been discounted a couple of times.", "deck": "Ninja Blade is a handful of cool moments surrounded by tedious, repetitive gameplay.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-146/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23661/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ninja-blade/3030-23661/", "id": 23661, "name": "Ninja Blade"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2009-04-26 20:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-80875/", "id": 80875, "name": "Ninja Blade"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/zeno-clash-review/1900-147/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/959234-25hzarb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-959234\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1600\" style=\"width: 1600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3419/959234-25hzarb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-959234\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3419/959234-25hzarb.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This is some of the best first-person melee combat in memory.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-22011\" href=\"/zeno-clash/3030-22011/\" slug=\"zeno-clash\">Zeno Clash</a> is one of the strangest, most original first-person games I've played in years. It focuses on elaborate, in-your-face melee combat, and it's set in a surreal, prehistoric fantasy world that's utterly weird, sometimes almost uncomfortably so. This <a data-ref-id=\"3015-751\" href=\"/source-engine/3015-751/\" slug=\"source-engine\">Source Engine</a>-powered downloadable game's production values have a few rough edges, but it's still well worth playing, offering around five hours of gameplay you aren't likely to forget anytime soon.</div><div><br/></div><div>Where do I even start describing Zeno Clash? You're <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9980\" href=\"/ghat/3005-9980/\" slug=\"ghat\">Ghat</a>, a young warrior on the lam in a stone-age land where it looks like everything from houses to guns is hewn from rock and animal bone. Ghat is wanted for the crime of killing his clan's leader, a 10-foot-tall hermaphroditic creature with taloned feet named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10042\" href=\"/father-mother/3005-10042/\" slug=\"father-mother\">Father-Mother</a>. In the game's world, humans have intermingled with animal people of all varieties. You fight enemies ranging from a giant elephant man to a bounty hunter who wears a crab mask and hurls exploding squirrel bombs at you from the back of a dinosaur.</div><div><br/></div><div>Are you weirded out? All I can say is, you haven't seen anything yet. The game tells its story by alternating between present events and playable flashbacks, and it's so full of strange characters and incomprehensible events that the plot is a little tough to follow from time to time. The good news is, enjoying the game is more about seeing the wonderfully bizarre sights and sounds it shows you from one fantastic location to the next. The organic level design and range of crazy characters is a real treat from the start of the game all the way to the end.</div><div><br/></div><div>If the story is damn near impossible to grasp, the combat at least is easy to pick up. You start learning the basic concepts of the intricate melee combat early on, including blocking, dodging, parrying, combo attacks, counterattacks, grapples, and throws.\u00a0What really makes the combat work is a lock-on system that takes the guesswork out of lining up your attacks with your opponent, causing you to pivot around them and letting you focus on when to dodge and when to move in for a strong punch.\u00a0That all might sound like a complicated set of fighting mechanics for a first-person game, but Zeno Clash takes its fighting seriously; you get a neat, familiar \"versus\" display before every encounter, showing you who you're fighting like in a fighting game. The combat is well thought-out, in other words.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/940928-fm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940928\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4236947791165\" data-width=\"498\" style=\"width: 498px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:142.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/940928-fm.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-940928\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4344/940928-fm.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Father-Mother is in the running for \"Creepiest New Character 2009.\"</figcaption></figure>The quality and brutal intensity of the melee combat is what makes Zeno Clash a success, though you do some shooting too, from time to time, using a set of bio-mechanical guns that look like they're straight out of the David Cronenberg film <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">eXistenz</span>. The gunplay isn't nearly as satisfying as the melee, but it gets the job done, and there's relatively little of it anyway. There's another cool couple of levels where you find a crystal-tipped staff that you can charge with a greenish energy that both acts as a torch, lighting your way, and lets you throw fireballs at a series of creepy, silent statue-people that rise from the ground and stalk you.</div><div><br/></div><div>Zeno Clash will probably take you around five hours to finish, and it's such a unique five hours I feel the $20 price tag would be justified as-is. But it's nice that the game also includes a challenge mode that sends you brawling your way through floor after floor of a large tower. It's essentially a rapid-fire series of quick melee challenges with an online leaderboard included for best times. Since the melee combat is the best thing about the game, this mode is a good way to keep you playing after the story is over.</div><div><br/></div><div>There aren't a lot of things you can knock Zeno Clash for. There are a few instances where it's hard to manage the number of opponents the game asks you to take on at one time, but you'll get better at that as you play more and improve your fighting skill. It's not the most technically impressive game, but that also means it will run fine on older hardware, and the great strength of the art design more than makes up for a dearth of shaders and polygons. And the voice acting only ranges from adequate to atrocious, though given the quality of the action, that shouldn't detract from your enjoyment much.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anyway, I suspect the quality of the voice work owes to what must have been quite a small budget, judging by the number of names in the credits. Zeno Clash comes from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6526\" href=\"/ace-team/3010-6526/\" slug=\"ace-team\">ACE Team</a> in Santiago, Chile, an indie studio founded by three brothers which has made an awfully impressive showing in Zeno Clash with its limited resources.

While the game's various recreations of ice are immediately impressive, it's the completely original story that sets Cryostasis up as an instant cult classic. As such, the game more directly compares to the films of Cronenberg or Carpenter than its peers in the horror-game genre, of which <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\" href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\" slug=\"bioshock\">BioShock</a> is the most direct influence.

Sled dogs at your side, you run into trouble almost immediately and realize that the surviving crew has been affected by some sort of malady that causes them to become extremely violent. The \"what\" and \"why\" of this scenario are unclear, and Alexander weaves his way through 17 chapters trying to unravel the mystery of just exactly what happened. While the plot itself sounds like standard fare, the delivery of the story and the eventual answers you receive are anything but standard.</div><div><br/></div><div>Cryostasis tells this mystery through some inventive devices that quite liberally use the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2796\" href=\"/been-here-before/3015-2796/\" slug=\"been-here-before\">been-here-before</a> concept, but with a unique twist. Essentially, you navigate the claustrophobic and decrepit North Wind in the present while experiencing real-time, jarring flashbacks from the past. Your protagonist is slowly fed the plot through the found scraps of a narrated folktale, the captain's diary and Alexander's unique ability to jump into the life of a fallen crew member just before their death. The last device in particular is one of the cooler new concepts I've seen in modern gaming. That's mostly because if Alexander can save a life in the past, he can affect his physical surroundings in the future and make good against the darkness that surrounds the ship. If all that sounds a little heavy and metaphysical, it is. The tale of the North Wind, its captain, first mate, nuclear engineer and crew are sure to be picked apart for a long time, much like a great film.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1403/314003-anabioz1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-314003\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1403/314003-anabioz1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-314003\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1403/314003-anabioz1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Light plays a big part in Cryostasis' visual style.</figcaption></figure>It's important to note that due to these devices, Cryostasis is a\u00a0decidedly\u00a0linear game. Not only do you progress through the chapters in a relatively straight line, but no lever switch or door opening is without specific meaning. Later levels will reference earlier levels but from a different perspective. You'll see the cause and carnage of the North Wind's stranding not only from three different decks, but many different pasts and many different perspectives <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">on</span> that past. Notice that weird stuffed polar bear? You'll see him again. If games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20716\" href=\"/braid/3030-20716/\" slug=\"braid\">Braid</a> and its high-concept peers are rethinking the idea of games as art, Cryostasis pushes the boundary of games as interpretive art. The game's ending and its general end thesis is up to the viewer. It's an exciting thing to witness and gives hope for the medium. It's also very weird.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>Though the title is currently marketed as a first-person shooter, Cryostasis should more appropriately be labeled a first-person adventure. The game does contain a fair amount of gunplay, but the enemies in each level can be counted on your hands, not by the dozen. The focus here is on exploration of your surroundings. Action fans also may not welcome Cryostasis' realistically imprecise weapons and lengthy reload times, which are used to heighten tension. Melee battles are specifically anxious affairs due to an exaggerated sway in your movements that draws out the timing and viewpoint of your swings. While this style of combat could rightfully be called clunky, it honestly felt\u00a0necessary\u00a0given the pace of the game. You should just know the combat is not for the impatient, and that death is not only a certainty, but a common occurrence. It might very well keep you from completing the game.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1403/355481-1888_cryostasis_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355481\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1403/355481-1888_cryostasis_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-355481\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1403/355481-1888_cryostasis_003.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1403/355481-1888_cryostasis_003.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can step into the past of a dead crew member just before they died.</figcaption></figure>While the star of the show is definitely Cryostasis' story, the game's audio and visual effects are just as impressive. Making heavy use of nVidia's Physx platform, Cyrostasis features the most impressive rendering of snow and ice yet seen in games. You'll navigate the mostly dark lower decks of the North Wind with only a flashlight and the ship's remaining lights, all used to great dramatic effect. Port holes blow in white light brightened by snow. Reflections play off of water. Decade-old lightbulbs creak with the feeling that they'll pop at any second. Then there's the reflective frigid ice, which is a constant menace since Alex's health meter is revived only by warming up near a heat source. The few times you do find yourself above decks, the snow and wind are so blinding and deadly that you simply jump from hotspot to hotspot to survive.</div><div><br/></div><div>All that frosty glitter does not come without a hefty price, though. Cryostasis is only optimized for single-core processors, so your performance is largely based on the video card you own. As such, there's quite a bit of uproar about the game's performance on some computers. While I personally had no problem running the game with all the bells and whistles turned on, I did run into over a dozen crashes throughout my play-through. Consistent with the feedback from other players' experiences on the official message boards, these crashes happened for me much more often in the later chapters. Luckily, the game makes liberal use of auto-saves and I never had any actual lost progress. It's definitely annoying, though, and these problems seem above average in frequency for a PC game. Players making it to these later levels will likely not be deterred, as the story becomes so meaty that you'll just want to forgive the game outright and keep going to the conclusion.</div><div><br/></div><div>In the end, Cryostasis is certainly a love-it-or-hate-it game. While the world it presents is breathtaking, the game's core combat and slow pace are what hold me back from recommending it to all audiences. However, if you tend to find yourself with more arty tastes in media, or are one of those gamers who thinks a good game necessitates a good story, Cryostasis might just be the game for you.</div>", "deck": "Russian developed Cryostasis is a chilly cult masterpiece thanks to its unique story and visual style.

X-Men Origins: Wolverine succeeds when it focuses on testing the limits of its hero's razor-sharp hand-knives and rapid health regeneration ability, often with results that would be gut-churning if they weren't so over-the-top. This is a game that earns its M rating with the gallons of viscera that pour forth from both Wolverine and his enemies, and it's definitely a more attention-grabbing game for it. The danger in relying on brutality and shock is that you have to keep upping the ante, or you'll quickly lose the player's attention. Wolverine heeds this maxim for a good two-thirds of its runtime, though it runs out of steam before it limps to its conclusion.<br/><br/> X-Men Origins: Wolverine takes its story cues from the movie of the same name, though like most of the enemies in the game, it's pretty well mangled. It still sheds some light on Wolverine's life before hooking up with the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-125\" href=\"/x-men/3025-125/\" slug=\"x-men\"> X-Men</a>, but the chronology's all mixed up, certain aspects of the story have been either expanded or condensed, and there's a considerable number of new plot turns thrown in for good measure. Some changes seem to be for the benefit of the game; others just seem arbitrary. If you're a person of the comic-book persuasion, the story here will probably provide no end of infuriation, though even if you're not, the end result is that you won't really care about the story. The good news is you don't really have to, since Wolverine's only real apparent motivation is to murder everyone and everything in sight.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/876610-953919_20090114_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876610\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/876610-953919_20090114_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-876610\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/876610-953919_20090114_screen004.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Wolverine hates helicopters almost as much as 50 Cent.</figcaption></figure>For the most part, X-Men Origins: Wolverine handles a lot like an easier, simpler <a data-ref-id=\"3025-244\" href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" slug=\"god-of-war\"> God of War</a>. There's a loose combo attack system, counterattacks, grab moves, environmental kills, some flashier rage attacks, and a lunge move that lets you rapidly get up-close and personal with an enemy. The combat is decidedly group-focused, though you'll regularly finding yourself squaring off against lumbering, goliath-type enemies. Aside from the lunge, which has a comically absurd edge to it, the pieces feel fairly common, but they fit together dynamically enough, and the bloody results are mighty satisfying.<br/><br/> For the first few hours it doesn't take much finesse to swiftly and brutally murder your foes, thanks in part to Wolverine's regenerating health. The enemies gradually get tougher, requiring you to be a little less sloppy and a little more thoughtful about how you take on your foes. There's an experience system at work here, so as the bad guys get stronger, so do you. Every time Wolverine levels up, you get a health bump and some points that you can sink into skills and attributes. There are mutagen collectibles you can find, which provide gameplay modifiers that can range from increasing the experience you earn from each kill to giving you back a sliver of health every time you attack an enemy.<br/><br/> As you might imagine from a character with six long-ass razor-sharp knives sticking out of his knuckles, every one of Wolverine's attacks is a blood-letting one, and the majority of his finishing moves leave his enemies in various states of vivisection, and the game isn't too squeamish not to slow down and zoom in on the carnage. Similarly, Wolverine himself can get pretty banged up, and it's not uncommon to see exposed muscle tissue or catch a peek at his adamantium-coated skeleton. The procedural battle damage can look a little goofy sometimes, particularly when dude's  <i>face</i> is missing and he's walking around like nothing's doing, but it still reinforces the fact that you are playing as a gentleman who should not be trifled with. No, not at  <i>all</i>.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/965711-wolverine_snow_scene_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-965711\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/965711-wolverine_snow_scene_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-965711\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/965711-wolverine_snow_scene_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/965711-wolverine_snow_scene_2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>HEY GUYS WHAT'S UP!</figcaption></figure>The game breaks up all the piping-hot death with crazy skydiving set pieces, switch-and-jump-based puzzles, and outsized boss battles. The skydive sequences, one of which has you leaping from one helicopter to another, leaving each looking like a can of dog food in your wake, are pretty thrilling. The puzzles usually aren't that complicated, but Wolverine's handling definitely seems more calibrated for wild and furious combat than precision jumping, which can make these sections feel clunky. The boss fights, while often massive in scope, have a tendency to feel artificially padded out. It doesn't take long to figure out most boss weaknesses, but you'll still be required to perform the same attack pattern over and over again. This is a problem that ends up affecting all of the combat at a point, and eventually even the basic grunts seem like they take way too long to dispatch.\u00a0<br/><br/> Coincidentally, this happened not too long after the game ran out of violent new tricks. Once the game stopped stunning me with new outrageous depictions of slaughter, the repetition of the combat started to set in, and I started noticing some of the game's other shortcomings, like the dodgy frame rate and buggy collision detection.

The main difference is that this version goes for $10 and offers online co-op and versus modes for up to four players. It's still a great offline game, and it's now available at an even better price, but the online is hampered by stutters of latency that cause everything to briefly seize up.<br/><br/><br/> In short, Space Invaders Extreme takes the base concept of shooting pixelated invaders and adds a bunch of combo counters to it. By shooting groups of same-colored invaders or same-shaped invaders, you'll achieve combos, some of which cause power-ups to appear, giving you bombs, wider shots, big-ass lasers, and so on. You can also chain your kills together to keep a chain meter going, increase your multiplier, and so on. All of this is made trickier by a constant influx of new invaders in different formations. You'll fight huge, laser-spewing invaders, or have to pick off tiny invaders with careful precision. Some enemies break for the ground when shot, forcing you to shoot a second time before the reach ground and kill you. Some explode when shot, setting off a chain reaction that takes other invaders along with it. You'll also enter separate bonus rounds that task you with hitting certain invaders before time expires, rewarding you with a brief section of \"fever time,\" where you have tons of firepower and the chance to rack up a lot of points. The point is that the game feels like it has a good variety of things to keep you on your toes.<br/><br/> Each of the game's stages ends with a boss fight, and the later stages come in multiple forms. Your score in the previous round is what grants you access to these different higher-end stages. This gives you a reason to keep playing the same stages more than once, as you try for better combos, more breaks, and more fever time to get a higher ranking. You can practice any stage you've previously played on in arcade mode.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/949702-thumb800x800_3424234355_cb5aea4ae2_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-949702\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/949702-thumb800x800_3424234355_cb5aea4ae2_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-949702\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/949702-thumb800x800_3424234355_cb5aea4ae2_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The laser quickly lays waste to the invading forces.</figcaption></figure>Outside of arcade mode, there are a few different multiplayer modes that you can play locally or over Xbox Live. Co-op lets up to four players take on the arcade mode. It doesn't make any real changes to the game to make it harder; you just have four ships in there firing shots instead of one. Each player has a separate combo meter, which is nice, but it can get sort of chaotic. You'd have to be really organized to line up a bunch of combos and other bonuses in a four-player game. Versus games let you play to see who can survive the longest or get the highest score. These games give each player their own screen, and new power-ups appear to help you take down the opposition. These modes are really cool additions, but it's tough to play online. There don't seem to be a ton of people playing, and each game I was able to get into suffered from network issues that made the game pretty tough to enjoy.<br/><br/> The presentation in Space Invaders Extreme really goes a long way. The enemies maintain their same, pixelated look from the original games while the backgrounds flicker and pulsate along with the music. The backgrounds never get too distracting, and they really look great. Each stage has its own music that sort of recalls the thumping beat of the original game without relying so heavily on it that it becomes annoying.

While it garnered enough of a following to generate a sequel and few other releases, the series never really caught on in a huge way, relegating this cute platformer to cult status. But there's nothing about the game itself that feels inaccessible or terribly deep, which is why it's cool that the original game is getting a second chance at life via a straight-up remake on the Wii. This new version recreates the levels and story of the first game, throws in some upgrades where appropriate, and sticks close to the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-660\" href=\"/25d/3015-660/\" slug=\"25d\"> 2D/3D</a> formula of the original game. Really, the only bad thing I could say about Klonoa is that standards for gameplay and difficulty have changed over the last decade, so some players might find the game to be both too easy and too short to capture their imagination for more than a weekend.<br/><br/> Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a 2D, sideview platformer with polygonal backgrounds that twist and turn behind you, giving the game a 3D look and feel. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-685\" href=\"/klonoa/3005-685/\" slug=\"klonoa\"> Klonoa</a> himself is a long-eared cat-like creature who rolls around with a gigantic ring. Inside the ring lives <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1051\" href=\"/huepow/3005-1051/\" slug=\"huepow\"> Huepoe</a> (retranslated from Huepow in the original version), a wind spirit who gives Klonoa some additional powers and typically hangs out in cutscenes. Klonoa's main ability is a wind-based attack that grabs enemies at range and reels them in so he can carry them around. When holding an enemy, you can toss it at other enemies or objects, or you can <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1\" href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" slug=\"double-jump\"> double jump</a> by shoving the enemy down at the ground in mid-air. Klonoa can also flap his ears for a second or so of hovering. So at its most difficult, you'll be using enemies to double jump, then perhaps catching another foe for another jump, then hovering over to a platform. It gets a little technical in spots, but for the most part, the game leaves the difficult jumps for optional collectibles and not the main level progression.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/207234-picture_5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207234\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74579831932773\" data-width=\"476\" style=\"width: 476px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1699/207234-picture_5.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-207234\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1699/207234-picture_5.png\"></a><figcaption>For comparison's sake, here's the PlayStation version.</figcaption></figure>Generally speaking, Klonoa is light-hearted fun. The levels aren't especially long, though the 3D perspective makes some of them a little tricky to follow. You'll get plenty of platformer-style boss fights along the way, too. But the only serious challenge comes from trying to go back through a second time and collect every gem in every level. The game lets you take on the action with one of several different control schemes, ranging from one that lets you use the Nunchuk, to holding the Wii Remote sideways, to using a Classic or a GameCube controller. Since there's no real finesse or analog movement to Klonoa's control, using the Nunchuk feels totally\u00a0unnecessary, but any of the other styles works great.<br/><br/> The game's primary weapon is its cuteness. Klonoa's style is very much of its time, and its cheery demeanor and blue, blue skies stick out when set against today's brown, post-apocalyptic releases. As such, it's easy to take Klonoa as a game that only kids could love. The new voice acting doesn't exactly steer away from that feeling, either. Originally, the characters spoke in a non-language reminiscent of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3984\" href=\"/star-fox/3030-3984/\" slug=\"star-fox\"> Star Fox</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10920\" href=\"/banjo-kazooie/3030-10920/\" slug=\"banjo-kazooie\"> Banjo-Kazooie</a>. While you can go back to that if you like, the game defaults to English, with the sort of character voices and script that give the game an even sweeter edge. The kids show vibe made me feel like one of the characters was going to break out into some sort of song about numbers or the difference between near and far or something. Of course, that's not necessarily a bad thing. The voices are well-done, but depending on your personal taste (or how much of a Klonoa purist you are), you might want to disable the English voices. Said purists might also bristle up at the new in-engine cutscenes, which replace the pre-rendered video found on the PlayStation. Personally, I always thought the old video version of Klonoa looked sort of evil with its overtly cat-like eyes and tiny fangs. I prefer the new in-engine stuff, but again, that's a pretty minor thing.<br/><br/> The best part about this new remake of Klonoa is that it's going for the discounted price of $29.99. Considering the game won't take you an especially long time to finish, that's a great price for a classic platformer that still has some appeal for modern players while also being charming enough for younger kids to get into, as well.", "deck": "The Wii remake of Klonoa is bright, colorful, and a lot of fun.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-151/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-9546/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/klonoa-door-to-phantomile/3030-9546/", "id": 9546, "name": "Klonoa: Door to Phantomile"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-05-11 10:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82085/", "id": 82085, "name": "Klonoa: Door to Phantomile"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/patapon-2-review/1900-152/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/932969-battlescene_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932969\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/932969-battlescene_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932969\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/932969-battlescene_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Pon! Pon! Pata! Pon!</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-14147\" href=\"/patapon/3030-14147/\" slug=\"patapon\"> Patapon</a> was one of the best things to happen to the PSP last year. It had all the personality of something like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-787\" href=\"/locoroco/3025-787/\" slug=\"locoroco\"> LocoRoco</a>, but with techno-tribal warfare in place of cloying whimsy, and it offered a blend of rhythmic action and strategic combat that was both unique and approachable.\u00a0Patapon 2 is out now, and it mostly offers the same kind of experience, but with a few minor tweaks and new features. It's different enough that if you liked the first one, you'll like this one, and if you haven't jumped into the Patapon pool yet, now is as good a time as any.<br/><br/> If you're new to Patapon, the basic idea is that you're commanding a small army of shouty, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2193\" href=\"/cyclops/3015-2193/\" slug=\"cyclops\"> monocular</a> creatures as they march across the screen from left to right, encountering enemies and various other obstacles along the way. You don't have any direct, one-to-one control over the Patapon, instead relying on the power of rhythm to compel them. Each of the face buttons corresponds to a percussive sound, and specific patterns trigger different actions. It's a basic call-and-response format--you throw out a four-beat pattern, your Patapon respond and react accordingly, you rinse and repeat.\u00a0The game gives you the three basic commands of advance, attack, and defend pretty much right out the gate, and they're your staple commands throughout.\u00a0You'll eventually discover additional chants that allow you to dodge attacks, charge into battle, and change the weather.\u00a0<br/><br/> The campaign in Patapon 2 is mostly pretty linear, though you can revisit past missions to pick up more money, resources, and equipment. The missions themselves tend to focus on specific tasks, like hunting prey, fighting giant boss monsters, or attacking entrenched enemy armies. Missions are never terribly long, usually topping out at around 10 minutes, which helps make Patapon a game that's theoretically easy to play in short bursts. Once you get some momentum going, though, it can be a tough game to put down.\u00a0The rhythmic action in Patapon 2 can feel pretty loose and forgiving, which matches the kind of improvised, electronic drum-circle sound of the music. To really flourish you need to chain together successful chants in order to trigger Fever mode, which makes your Patapon attack more fiercely.\u00a0A lot of the music seems recycled from the first Patapon, but it still works, and its capacity for getting hopelessly stuck in your head isn't diminished in the least.\u00a0<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/932970-battlescene_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932970\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/932970-battlescene_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-932970\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/932970-battlescene_02.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Pata! Pata! Pata! Pon!</figcaption></figure>Your input is kind of limited during combat, so a lot of the strategy in Patapon 2 comes during the planning phase, when you're deciding which types of Patapon to bring with you. Patapon come in a number of different classes, starting off with basic sword-and-shield units, archers, and pikemen, eventually expanding into horsemen, flying units, and other exotic types. You can equip each of your Patapon with different armor and weapons that you collect during battle, and there's an extensive evolutionary system at work as well, which can radically alter how individual Patapon handle.\u00a0You can bring three different classes of Patapon with you, and up to six individual Patapon within each class, though you won't start out with a full company of 18.\u00a0You'll have to complete missions to earn the cash and supplies you'll need to create new Patapon. In addition to these three class groups, you'll also get a hero character who you can assign different classes to before you get to marching, and who, if your timing is particularly spot-on, can perform particularly powerful special attacks.\u00a0Every one of these choices can have a significant impact on how a mission might play out, though the game offers enough assistance, in the forms of hints and an auto-equip option, to keep it from being too overwhelming.\u00a0<br/><br/> Patapon 2 introduces multiplayer to the series, allowing up to four players to bring their heroes out on a shared adventure where you have to protect a big-ass, mysterious egg against peril, which can yield some rare items if you're successful. If none of your PSP-having buddies have picked up Patapon 2, there's a game-sharing option as well. It's worth noting that Patapon 2 is only available as a PlayStation Network download here in the US, no UMD, so you'll need a Memory Stick with a good 360 megs of free space to play it. This seems like it could be the future for the PSP, and while I could see some folks preferring to buy physical media, the upshot here is that you get a lot more battery life out of your PSP when you're not constantly spinning that UMD. Also, Sony is offering Patapon 2 right out the gate for the same price of $19.99 that you can pick up the original for on UMD.<br/><br/> Patapon was charming as hell, with its weirdly emotive characters and the chanting music that had a way of insinuating itself into your subconscious. Patapon 2 hits the same notes, and it hits them just as hard, though as a mildly iterative sequel, it might not have the same impact on returning players. If you haven't played Patapon before, though, this is arguably a more approachable game, and a more attractive package in general.", "deck": "Patapon 2 expands on the rhythmic strategy of its predecessor without undermining the approachability or the depth that made it such a success in the first place.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-152/", "platforms": "PlayStation Portable", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21113/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/patapon-2/3030-21113/", "id": 21113, "name": "Patapon 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-05-13 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73876/", "id": 73876, "name": "Patapon 2"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/velvet-assassin-review/1900-153/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/964800-6635620090501_145314_2_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-964800\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/964800-6635620090501_145314_2_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-964800\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7423/964800-6635620090501_145314_2_big.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The decent premise is squandered on maddening stealth mechanics.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-20573\" href=\"/velvet-assassin/3030-20573/\" slug=\"velvet-assassin\"> Velvet Assassin</a> is a stealth game that feels like a relic from the time when stealth games were still new and interesting. I'm talking about the early, unforgiving days of the genre, when it was all about things like incessantly studying and memorizing enemy movement patterns; completely disabling your sense of disbelief as you \"hid\" in areas of vague shadow; and getting punished mercilessly every time you were detected. It's 2009; does that still sound like fun to you?<br/><br/> Even if you're in the minority of masochists who would answer \"yes\" to that question, I've got bad news: Velvet Assassin doesn't even execute those stale old mechanics, contrived as they are, with any degree of competency.<br/><br/> It's a shame the gameplay is such a mess, because Velvet Assassin at least finds a way to put a fairly original spin on the World War II setting. You're British secret operative <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10487\" href=\"/violette-summer/3005-10487/\" slug=\"violette-summer\"> Violette Summer</a>, going behind German lines to sabotage the Nazi war effort by blowing up fuel depots, disabling U-boats, helping out other allied spies, and so forth. Summer is based on real-life WWII operative <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Violette_Szabo\" rel=\"nofollow\"> Violette Szabo</a>, and I initially found her pretty appealing for her relatively realistic proportions and general lack of the hypersexualization that makes a lot of video game heroines hard to take seriously. (OK, she appears in her undergarments when you activate the game's dreamy version of bullet time, but otherwise, she's a heck of a lot more tasteful than <a data-ref-id=\"3005-195\" href=\"/lara-croft/3005-195/\" slug=\"lara-croft\"> Lara Croft</a>.)<br/><br/> At any rate, whatever goodwill I had toward the game evaporated when I started playing it, since the stealth mechanics range from boring to ludicrous to maddeningly frustrating. Like most stealth games, this one considers you \"visible\" or \"not visible\" depending on factors like whether you're crouching, and whether you're in the light or in what passes for shadows. A better stealth game would at least let you use cover and shadow to intelligently conceal yourself and react dynamically to enemy movements to slink around and achieve your objectives without being detected.<br/><br/> But Velvet Assassin's stealth is poorly designed and inconsistent to the point of absurdity. Sometimes guards will walk right by you as you dump a body half in and half out of shadow, like nothing's going on. More often, they'll spot you from far away when it seems like you ought to be properly hidden in the shadows. Other stealth games set in modern times give you high-tech doohickeys like radar and night vision to help you get a leg up on the AI, but here you're just expected to develop a sixth sense about who can see you and where you can safely hide. With very little feedback from the interface, environment, and enemies, that's extremely hard to do.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1403/557939-10504_48a46de307aa0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-557939\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55709779179811\" data-width=\"1585\" style=\"width: 1585px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1403/557939-10504_48a46de307aa0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-557939\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1403/557939-10504_48a46de307aa0.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Think you're safely hidden? Don't be so sure.</figcaption></figure>It wouldn't be so bad if escape was easy or even possible, but the game's most damning issue is its utterly unforgiving stance on getting caught. The second any guard sees you, every enemy in the area opens fire on you, and seconds later you're dead, almost every single time. Since the checkpoints are spread pretty far apart and there are so many unpredictable ways to get caught, every mission degenerates into a repetitive series of retries as you try to learn exactly the right way to meticulously pick your way through every section of the level. It's a little like banging your head into a wall over and over till you finally bust through it; not my idea of fun.<br/><br/> There are plenty of other little issues that get in the way. It doesn't help that the game makes clumsy use of lighting and its color palette to communicate safe areas to the player. The only areas where you're truly hidden from the guards are literally almost pitch black on the screen, and since turning on your flashlight immediately draws attention and gets you killed, you often end up fumbling around blindly trying to sneak around or pull off a stealth kill without getting caught. And frankly, the number of completely pitch-black warehouses, offices, prisons, and depots in the Third Reich is sort of ridiculous from a believability standpoint. In this game's version of history, it seems like the Wehrmacht must have lost the war because it couldn't afford enough light bulbs.<br/><br/> Meanwhile, darkened areas that look like they would hide you in a normal stealth game might as well be broad daylight here, so there's nothing really intuitive about the stealth and hiding here. I also had some issues with collision detection, getting shot or spotted through walls and closed doors. Some guards would get hung up on level geometry in some places and then teleport halfway across a room a few seconds later. The list of flaws that make the game a chore to play is a mile long.<br/><br/> But it's not worth harping on all them. Velvet Assassin has a neat premise, but I knew before the second mission was over that I never wanted to play it again. It's just too repetitive, frustrating, and archaically designed to make it recommendable even to diehard stealth fans.

Unfortunately, a lot of the things that surround all that swinging around haven't been handled quite so nicely. The end result is a game that has moments of brilliance that are bogged down by weird constraints.

Executing a set number of melee kills, taking down two enemies with one shotgun blast, executing properly timed consecutive swings, and killing guys by flinging objects in their direction are just some of the things that you'll be asked to accomplish. Some of these challenges just unlock more challenges when completed, but you'll also get better armor, faster reload times, and other helpful upgrades for playing along.</div><div><br/></div><div>The structure of Bionic Commando is completely linear, with waypoints appearing to keep you focused on the next objective. You'll swing through the ruins of Ascension City, head underground a few times to fly through caves, head out to the docks, swing around an oil rig, and so on. Occasionally you'll have to stop and deal with some enemies. To do that, you're armed with a basic weapon, a one-shot gun that is the dictionary definition of \"pea shooter.\" It sounds weak, it feels weak, and it fires as quickly as you can pull the trigger--which can actually make it a bit more powerful than it is normally, since you can rattle off shots at a pretty high rate. The aiming reticle is large, though it gets smaller if you zoom in, letting you pull off head shots at medium range. But standing on the ground, firing this thing at other enemies who are firing back, is pretty boring. Most of the other guns in the game--like a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">sniper rifle</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotgun</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-252\" href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252/\" slug=\"grenade-launcher\">grenade launcher</a>, and a fully automatic machine gun--are pretty standard and aren't much fun to use. I did, however, really enjoy using the Tarantula, a lock-on <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">rocket launcher</a> that can fire multiple shots at different targets by painting the targets before releasing the fire button. But you don't find it too often in the single-player game, and all of the secondary weapons have really strict ammo limits that prevent you from using them for long.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10266-nathan_rad_spencer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10266\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4/10266-nathan_rad_spencer.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-10266\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/4/10266-nathan_rad_spencer.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Spencer's new look has 'ex-prisoner' written all over it.</figcaption></figure>It almost feels like the developers deliberately made most of the guns lame to put more of a focus on your arm. Using the arm in combat is decidedly more entertaining. You'll be able to pick up objects in the environment and fling them at enemies, or you can refrain from getting fancy and just grab enemies directly and toss them at other foes, or off ledges. If you like, you can whip enemies up with the arm and use your guns to keep them airborne until they're dead. Or you can punch cars up into the air, jump up after them, and kick them at your adversaries. These methods are more entertaining, but fighting the regular enemies is rarely difficult, so even this doesn't stay exciting from start to finish.</div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to just fighting regular dudes, you'll also encounter a few different varieties of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-21\" href=\"/mech/3055-21/\" slug=\"mech\">mech</a> suits or flying machines over the course of the game. Some of these are ground-based, while others fly around, launching missiles or energy blasts in your direction. Lobbing grenades or shooting other explosives in their direction is the easiest way to deal with these threats, but since ammo is usually fairly scarce, you'll have to lob large objects at them with your arm, or use other methods to get them to expose their back, where a weak point can be grappled onto and kicked. These fights, while not quite boss fights, take a bit of time to handle and force you to think. They're not always great, but it's the best that combat gets in Bionic Commando.</div><div><br/></div><div>The deeper into Bionic Commando I got, the more it felt like someone realized that the more enemies that got placed into the world, the less exciting the game became. So it's kind of nice that there are large stretches of the game where it's just you and the environment, with very occasional breaks for a bit of combat before you get back to swinging through the air. This stuff, combined with a bunch of collectible objects strewn throughout the game, is probably the best part of the entire game.\u00a0However, the game isn't quite as open and free as that probably makes it sound. The world is covered with blue-tinged walls and blue clouds that are meant to serve as radiation, making them dangerous places to be. Really, it's just a system of invisible walls and constraints designed to keep you on track. It's disappointing because, again, once you get the hang of climbing buildings with your arm and swinging around, you're filled with a desire to explore. But the game doesn't allow as much of that as it should. Water is also used to restrict your movement, as you'll sink like a rock and die if you fall into the water and can't immediately grapple your way out. Additionally, the game is broken up into areas that are separated by some very lengthy load times, which segments the world into chunks of varying size.</div><div><br/></div><div>Bionic Commando is a great-looking game that creates a heavy atmosphere as you move from place to place. The bombed-out city is full of big craters, torn-up buildings, and debris. Underground, you'll hook onto stalactites, deal with tremors, and see some terrific\u00a0subterranean cave\u00a0areas. Spencer and the other characters in the game look pretty good, too, though I didn't really appreciate Spencer's \"edgy guy with dreadlocks\" look so much. If you want a classic feel, owners of Bionic Commando Rearmed can unlock a classic Rad model and use that, instead... but his shades and decidedly retro look stick out amongst the edgy tone the game attempts to hit.</div><div><br/></div><div>Speaking of an edgy tone, the game doesn't hit it terribly well. The voice acting from Spencer, done by singer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-82285\" href=\"/mike-patton/3040-82285/\" slug=\"mike-patton\">Mike Patton</a>, is mostly done in a low growl that attempts to convey discontent at the situation. It all ends up sounding like someone trying to take something very seriously and failing miserably. Some of the other characters, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-52\" href=\"/super-joe/3005-52/\" slug=\"super-joe\">Super Joe</a>, who spends most of the game guiding you from point to point and giving you mission updates, are done a bit better. One nice thing about the voice acting is that there are multiple takes for some lines, so if you die and have to see a part twice, sometimes you'll get a different line. Sometimes this is serious, and sometimes it's some kind of insane joke. For example, the default line when you first encounter a giant worm boss has Super Joe telling you that \"you're just going to have to fight it.\" The second time, he said \"you're just going to have to <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">fuck</span> it,\" resulting in a long \"uhhhhhh\" from both Spencer and myself. At times you can feel some of the campy writing that resulted from the poor translation of the Japanese NES game coming through, but there aren't enough \"you damn fool\" or \"get the heck out of here, you nerd\" moments to make it work.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/592524-vlcsnap_365891.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-592524\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/592524-vlcsnap_365891.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-592524\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/592524-vlcsnap_365891.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/592524-vlcsnap_365891.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hangin' around, doin' whatevs.</figcaption></figure>In addition to the main campaign, which comes in three difficulty levels, Bionic Commando also has a pretty solid multiplayer mode that, again, depends on your ability with the arm. At its best, the game almost feels like dogfighting, with multiple players swinging around, launching through the air, attempting to grapple directly onto an enemy to slow him down for the kill. On some of the larger maps, though, the game sort of bogs down as players attempt to get the one-shot-kill sniper rifle or grab the Tarantula and launch lock-on missiles. It supports up to eight players and offers the standard trinity of multiplayer modes: <a data-ref-id=\"3015-451\" href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" slug=\"deathmatch\">deathmatch</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">team deathmatch</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-25\" href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" slug=\"capture-the-flag\">capture the flag</a>. While it probably won't replace your multiplayer shooter of choice, it's a fun diversion from the campaign that works better than it seems like it should. But it suffers a bit by being more combat-focused, putting more of an emphasis on the underwhelming weapons. The matching is pretty fully featured, containing a Halo-like party system, and it also has support for clan tags.</div><div><br/></div><div>Bionic Commando goes back and forth between moments of great, navigation-based gameplay and a lot of little touches that don't work as well as you'd like. It makes the final product a little frustrating, because you can almost see a better game trying to bust its way out of its constraints. But more often than not, I was really taken by the game's rewarding swinging controls and terrific looks. If you consider yourself something of a swinger, I think you'll probably feel the same way.</div>", "deck": "Bionic Commando has moments of brilliance that help cover the game's flaws, but really, it all comes down to how much you like swinging around.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-154/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20470/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bionic-commando/3030-20470/", "id": 20470, "name": "Bionic Commando"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-05-17 23:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72381/", "id": 72381, "name": "Bionic Commando"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/punch-out-review/1900-155/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/705635-02_gj_bodypunch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-705635\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54807692307692\" data-width=\"832\" style=\"width: 832px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/705635-02_gj_bodypunch.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-705635\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/705635-02_gj_bodypunch.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Knock him out!</figcaption></figure>At face value, the idea of trying to remake <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20705\" href=\"/punch-out-featuring-mr-dream/3030-20705/\" slug=\"punch-out-featuring-mr-dream\">Punch-Out!!</a> in the year 2009 seems like a dicey proposition at best. The original Punch-Out!! holds incredible nostalgic value for a lot of people, myself included, but the simple <span><span>pattern-recognition</span></span> gameplay doesn't seem like it would hold up today. On the other hand, trying to modernize Punch-Out!! with more complicated controls or a more realistic approach to boxing could very easily undermine the game's accessible appeal. Somehow, Nintendo manages to avoid both of these pitfalls with Punch-Out!! for the Wii, a game that capitalizes on the game's nostalgic legacy without feeling pandering or rehashed.</div><div><br/></div><div>The biggest strength that Punch-Out!! has is that it recognizes the things that make Punch-Out!! such a fondly remembered game in the first place. First and foremost it's the larger-than-life, caricatured fighters you face off against as the plucky and diminutive <a data-ref-id=\"3005-357\" href=\"/little-mac/3005-357/\" slug=\"little-mac\">Little Mac</a>. The game features the full roster from the original Punch-Out!! To be clear, this means you'll sadly be squaring off against <span><a data-ref-id=\"3005-166\" href=\"/mr-sandman/3005-166/\" slug=\"mr-sandman\">Mr. Sandman</a></span>, and not <a data-ref-id=\"3005-170\" href=\"/mike-tyson/3005-170/\" slug=\"mike-tyson\">Mike Tyson</a>, for your title belt. Mr. Sandman is a fine opponent, and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> has a fistful of good reasons to want to steer clear of Tyson, but for me, it's one of the few improvements that could have been made.</div><div><br/></div><div>There are a couple of new fighters, as well as one from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6029\" href=\"/super-punch-out/3030-6029/\" slug=\"super-punch-out\">Super Punch-Out!!</a>, and while many of the fighters are based on cultural or ethnic caricatures that might be borderline insensitive in 2009, it's all presented with a tone that's too easy-going and absurd to take that seriously. You'd have to have a pretty sour disposition to take offense at croissants falling out of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-278\" href=\"/glass-joe/3005-278/\" slug=\"glass-joe\">Glass Joe</a> when you knock him down, or the pieces of sushi that circle <a data-ref-id=\"3005-158\" href=\"/piston-hondo/3005-158/\" slug=\"piston-hondo\">Piston Hondo</a>'s head when you've got him dazed. It's perfectly fine, though, to be offended by the fact that they changed <span>Piston Honda</span>'s name, presumably for legal reasons.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game pays a loving amount of attention to the way the fighters look, move, and sound, which is good, because they take up most of the screen and supply the game with its personality. Considering this is the first Punch-Out!! game since polygonal graphics and voice acting became the norm, it's a novelty in and of itself to see and hear these characters rendered this way, but they're also just really well executed. The cel-shaded graphics compliment the fighters' cartoonishly exaggerated physiques, and there's an expressiveness to the characters that, even when they're speaking a foreign language, let you know what's on their mind. Little Mac remains the silent protagonist, though his trainer Doc is eager to spout misremembered boxing platitudes, helpful advice, or whatever errant thought might be sauntering through his head in between rounds. The game mines the classic Punch-Out!! music quite successfully, and it really benefits from the energetic instrumentation.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/944187-954363_20090325_790screen003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944187\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.59620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:59.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/944187-954363_20090325_790screen003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944187\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7423/944187-954363_20090325_790screen003.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Don't let his size fool you, Little Mac packs a punch.</figcaption></figure>Also key to the Punch-Out!! experience is the gameplay, which boils boxing down to a simple-yet-effective combination of pattern recognition and crackerjack timing. This isn't <a data-ref-id=\"3025-190\" href=\"/fight-night/3025-190/\" slug=\"fight-night\">Fight Night</a>, so you don't have to sweat ring position or, really, anything remotely resembling actual boxing, but this game does make some appreciable modifications to the core Punch-Out!! formula. Taking a page from Super Punch-Out!!, you can duck as well as dodge incoming punches, and a lot of attacks require you to move in a specific way to avoid taking damage. The other fighters have a bizarre tendency to telegraph their different punches and combos in really obvious, flamboyant ways, and it doesn't help their cause when they flash red right before they come for you. You might recognize a lot of the fighters, and maybe even some of their specific moves and weaknesses, but they've all got a few new tricks up their sleeves. The game takes its time ramping up the difficulty, though there comes a point where your timing and your reflexes are just as paramount to success as your ability to memorize a fighter's patterns.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>Structurally, the game initially might seem identical to the original. You work your way up through 13 fighters in three different circuits before you can call the WVBA championship yours. Once you get the belt, though, you unlock a second stage to your career, where you have to defend your title against the same fighters you just bested. This time, though, they've been training for you, and everyone is tougher, faster, and craftier in the ring. Many of them have changed their look dramatically, sometimes in ways that effect their core characteristics.\u00a0</div><div><br/></div><div>Glass Joe, for example, enters the ring wearing headgear that keeps his glass jaw from being such a liability. Similarly, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-207\" href=\"/king-hippo/3005-207/\" slug=\"king-hippo\">King Hippo</a> rolls in with a manhole cover taped over his usually tender belly button. In both of these cases, it adds a second layer of figuring out how to overcome these fighters' new defenses, though everyone comes with a number of devastating new attacks. It's a clever design choice that addresses the issue of brevity when it comes to Punch-Out!!, even if it's not massive. For me, this is where Punch-Out!! really started getting tough in the way that I remember Punch-Out!! being tough, though it doesn't punish you for a loss by starting you back at square one. You can take as many runs at a fighter as you need, and there's a training mode where you can take on a fighter without the admittedly minor penalty of ruining your win/loss record.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game also offers a two-player split-screen mode, pitting two Little Macs against each other. The action feels decidedly different here, and not just because of the fact that you're going up against someone who, at least to start, is the same size as you. The timing is much tighter, and if you take too long to throw a punch, or your opponent blocks or dodges your punch, you turn blue, which temporarily prevents you from throwing any punches. The best part about the multiplayer is the ability to transform into <span>Giga Mac</span> when you land enough punches. In addition to turning you into a monstrous, wild-haired freak, it switches from split-screen to a perspective that mimics the single-player game, essentially letting you play the game as one of the outsized fighters you're always going up against. Without any options to speak of, the multiplayer feels slight, but it's got some brief appeal.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3017/972243-punch_out_king_hippo_td_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-972243\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.70813397129187\" data-width=\"418\" style=\"width: 418px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3017/972243-punch_out_king_hippo_td_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-972243\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3017/972243-punch_out_king_hippo_td_02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3017/972243-punch_out_king_hippo_td_02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>A familiar face with a new trick.</figcaption></figure>You can play Punch-Out!! a couple of different ways on the Wii. You can go with just the Wii remote held sideways, providing control that's nearly identical to the NES classic, or you can go with a remote-and-nunchuk combo that you can swing at the screen to throw punches. There's also support for the Wii Balance Board, which you can use to duck and dodge incoming attacks. Personally, I found that the experience suffered with the motion controls and the optional balance board, particularly as the game gets harder. The gameplay in Punch-Out!! is very digital in nature, and the remote-only setup plays to that fact. With the motion controls, I felt like I was getting something that was more complicated without being tangibly better.</div><div><br/></div><div>Not to harp on this point too much, but save for the inclusion of Mike Tyson, I'm not sure you could expect much better from a Punch-Out!! remake. That's not to say you couldn't make an arcade-style boxing game that was deeper and longer-lasting, but then it just wouldn't be Punch-Out!!</div>", "deck": "Punch-Out!! builds on the strengths of the NES original in some smart, simple ways that, when combined with a stylish, playful presentation, makes for a terrific experience.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-155/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23965/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/punch-out/3030-23965/", "id": 23965, "name": "Punch-Out!!"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-05-19 08:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-81632/", "id": 81632, "name": "Punch-Out!!"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/ufc-2009-undisputed-review/1900-156/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3018/210024-ufc200910.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-210024\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3018/210024-ufc200910.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-210024\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3018/210024-ufc200910.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Whatever happens here will probably hurt someone.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-20747\" href=\"/ufc-2009-undisputed/3030-20747/\" slug=\"ufc-2009-undisputed\">UFC 2009 Undisputed</a> is a great representation of the actual sport of Mixed Martial Arts fighting. It captures the hard hits and the vicious knockouts as well as the thrill of strategic ground-based combat and submission maneuvers. The fighting system is easy to understand, but offers a great, complex layer that allows different players to have their own styles and a system of moves and countermoves that makes the fights really exciting. About the only catch is that the single-player side of UFC 2009 feels a little thin. But it trains you well enough for the game's great multiplayer to still be worthwhile.</div><div><br/></div><div>Those of you who remember the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-248\" href=\"/ufc/3025-248/\" slug=\"ufc\">old UFC games</a> that started appearing back on the Dreamcast will notice some similarities in this new game, but the fighting is much deeper this time around. A big part of UFC's fighting is that it can take place standing up, with one player down, and with both players on the ground in various positions. All of these positions, and the transitions between them, translate into a lot of things you'll need to learn to do well. It's easy to understand the various blocks, attacks, and counters at work, but figuring out which ones to use and when takes a lot more time to master. It's the fighting system that makes UFC so awesome, and playing against human opponents of a similar skill level offers a thrilling mix of boxing game ring position work and fighting game technicality.</div><div><br/></div><div>When playing alone, the game offers a career mode that has you select opponents and go through training. There's a calendar that shows the weeks you have remaining, and it's up to you to balance your stamina between sparring, training, and resting to make sure you go into the fight with higher statistics while still having enough stamina to actually win the fight. Along the way you'll earn \"cred\" and unlock sponsors that can be placed on your trunks to earn an additional cred bonus. The trunk customization is sort of an insufferable process due to all the menus you need to slog through to get there. It takes forever just to select ten logos to slap onto your trunks, and since you're always unlocking better sponsors, you'll probably have to keep coming back to it again and again. Also, just getting from event to event takes too long. Between all the little load times between menus, the slow-going trunk customization, the slow-moving menus on the e-mail screen, and everything else, navigating your way through the career is kind of a hassle. Also, once you win the belt, the game just keeps throwing the same handful of high-ranking fighters at you over and over again without making them any tougher. After getting 15 straight wins with my light heavyweight striking-focused assassin, Ricker Stevensenson, it felt like I was just grinding away to get my stats up.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6720/801192-lesnar2.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-801192\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2\" data-width=\"250\" style=\"width: 250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6720/801192-lesnar2.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-801192\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6720/801192-lesnar2.jpg.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Former WWE wrestler Brock Lesnar is one of the many available UFC fighters.</figcaption></figure>Beyond just setting up one-off exhibition fights, the other single-player mode lets you relive classic match-ups. These fights are set up with video packages that provide the proper context for them, and you're given the fight's conclusion and have a goal to recreate that conclusion. Some of these are kind of tough because the AI fighters aren't very hard to beat. So trying to win a fight by decision is hard because getting knockouts can happen almost by accident. Also, getting the AI-controlled fighters to submit is way tougher than knocking them out.</div><div><br/></div><div>But all of the flaws and hiccups in the single-player are quickly forgotten when you start taking on human opposition. Offline, two players can get into it locally in the exhibition mode. But online, the game has some interesting stuff in place to track your ranked fights. Points you earn in ranked fights go toward increasing your level, and you also earn or lose fans after each fight. You'll get more points after a fight for specific tasks, too, like getting a knockout, forcing an opponent to tap, winning quickly, or ending an opponent's win streak. Another cool feature is that the game presents a few traits on the fighter select screen that show your opponent some details about how you fight. So it might say that you prefer fighting on the ground, or that you aren't afraid to strike, and so on. It's a little thing, but it makes your fights feel more meaningful, like you're stringing together some kind of online fight career.</div><div><br/></div><div>The character models in UFC 2009 Undisputed look great, but don't always animate that well. While specific animations look great, seeing them repeated across fighters or seeing them poorly transition from one canned animation to the next makes the game look a little awkward in spots. But the strikes hit hard, the knockouts look devastating, and the submissions look, well, like they'd probably make you tap out, too. The audio features two-man commentary that repeats itself a little too often and only has background information on the game's real-life fighters. When you're playing a ton of career mode with a created fighter, it would have been nice to hear the announcers occasionally reference the career you've made for yourself.</div><div><br/></div><div>If you're looking for a game you can play alone, UFC 2009 Undisputed will probably get pretty boring for you. Even with multiple difficulty settings, fighting the AI doesn't stay exciting for very long. But if you're in a household with multiple UFC fans or enjoy getting online, you'll love it.</div>", "deck": "The single-player options are a little slim, but taking the fight to opponents over the Internet is absolutely awesome.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-156/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20747/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ufc-2009-undisputed/3030-20747/", "id": 20747, "name": "UFC 2009 Undisputed"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-05-19 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82412/", "id": 82412, "name": "UFC 2009 Undisputed"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/art-style-pictobits-review/1900-157/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/875878-picopict05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875878\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/875878-picopict05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875878\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/14945/875878-picopict05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can never have enough pixel-art Nintendo characters.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-25165\" href=\"/art-style-pictobits/3030-25165/\" slug=\"art-style-pictobits\">PiCTOBiTS</a> is the latest game in Nintendo's quirky, retro-themed <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1097\" href=\"/art-style/3025-1097/\" slug=\"art-style\">Art Style</a> series, and it's one of the first honest, challenging puzzle games to hit the newly launched <span><a href=\"http://www.nintendodsi.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">DSiWare</a></span> download service. It plays a little like a touch-screen version of the old shooting puzzler <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17186\" href=\"/quarth/3030-17186/\" slug=\"quarth\">Quarth</a>. You use the stylus to pick up colored blocks at the bottom of the screen and drop them in the path of falling, incomplete shapes to fill in their gaps and clear them from the board. It's a new spin on the old \"falling blocks\" puzzle trope and a great way to hone your reflexes on your new DSi.\u00a0<br/></div><div><br/></div><div>PiCTOBiTS' simple concept is enhanced by a combo mechanic that lets you set up chains where clearing one set of colored blocks will cause other different-colored blocks to also be cleared. The game starts off slow, but after a few levels the shapes will be dropping so fast and in such complex patterns that at first you'll be scrambling just to keep up with the deluge. Luckily, you have a POW feature that clears the bottom few rows and drops all the hovering blocks to the bottom--at the cost of one slot in your block queue (where blocks you've picked up are stored before you put them back down.) In harder levels the game turns into a real balancing act that tests both your reflexes and your ability to quickly match patterns and colors. It's hectic in a fun, satisfying way.</div><div><br/></div><div>The Art Style series often trades in 8-bit aesthetics and rosy Nintendo nostalgia, and PiCTOBiTS continues that trend. Each of the colored blocks you're completing on the touch screen acts as a pixel in a classic Nintendo character on the top screen, so as you complete a level, you start to build up a sprite of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2891\" href=\"/goomba/3015-2891/\" slug=\"goomba\">goomba</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-928\" href=\"/ice-climbers/3005-928/\" slug=\"ice-climbers\">Ice Climber</a>, some <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15025\" href=\"/excitebike/3030-15025/\" slug=\"excitebike\">Excitebike</a> racers, or other favorites up top. The chiptune music is straight out of those old games, too, with some remixes provided by Japanese group YMCK. There are definitely hooks here for the diehard Nintendo fan in you.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/875877-picopict04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875877\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/875877-picopict04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-875877\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14945/875877-picopict04.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Excitebike. Just because.</figcaption></figure>There's a decent progression mechanic here that carries over between levels, too. You earn coins as you play, based on your combo performance, and those coins can be used to unlock all of the game's music in a standalone player that keeps on playing when you close the DSi. You can also buy \"dark\" versions of each stage that feature different sprites of the same characters and which are also way, way harder than the originals. (I love how the purchase screen for these levels lists the required number of coins as the \"dark price.\" Sinister!)</div><div><br/></div><div>Given the dual nature of each stage, and the fact that the pieces are randomized in the first place, you could be playing PiCTOBiTS for quite a while. I wouldn't recommend playing it in a moving vehicle, since you need to be pretty precise with the stylus. Overall, this a tough, rewarding puzzle game that will take you a while to master, and even longer to unlock all the available content. At $5, PiCTOBiTS costs only half the value of the free DSiWare points you get with a new DSi--and if you're serious about playing games, this is a challenging way to break in the service.</div><div><br/></div><div>For visually oriented among you, It might be easier to understand PiCTOBiTS gameplay if you\u00a0<span>see it in motion</span>.

More often than not such genre-bending produces a game like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20481\" href=\"/battlestations-pacific/3030-20481/\" slug=\"battlestations-pacific\"> Battlestations: Pacific</a>--a title whose accessible mix of strategy and action ends up simplifying both elements to a level where nothing in either mechanic stands out. But what the game misses in depth, it makes up in volume. You'll have many dozens of land, sea, and air units at your command by the end of the 15 or so hours it'll take to complete the campaign. When you factor in some questionable story elements and several grind-away missions, however, the game gets tedious well before it's over.<br/></div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/865499-ii.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-865499\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/865499-ii.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-865499\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/865499-ii.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Nothing beats a good old bombing run.</figcaption></figure>Battlestations: Pacific refers to WWII's Pacific theater of war, where the US and Japan fought it out. Starting with the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the game presents two separate campaigns where you can either relive history, or in the case of the Japanese campaign, remake it. Over the course of the game's 28 missions you'll land seaplanes to recover spy information, drop torpedos on surprised carrier convoys, and make stealth runs into Sydney Harbor with your prototype midget-submarine. These occasional moments of brilliance, though, are unfortunately mixed in with missions that boil down to the usual bomb, escort, or capture variety. Although some of the later island-capture levels can run past the hour mark, most of your objectives can be completed in about 30 minutes a piece. The game provides a plentiful amount of checkpoints to make sure you never lose too much time if you botch the job the first time.</div><br/><div>Battlestations is ambitious about the sheer number of units you'll eventually gain access to. While the first few battles will involve a single unit or squadron, you'll eventually gain the ability to command an entire carrier group or island strongpoint. You'll flip between battleships, cruisers, patrol-boats, submarines, and troop carriers. And that's just your navy. You'll also have full control over a seemingly limitless variety of attack planes and bombers. The good news is that they're all easy to switch in and out of during even the most hectic battles. The bad news is that each class of unit--be it ship, plane, or submarine--plays almost exactly the same. The only difference you'll notice between each is the number of guns, bombs, or torpedos you carry and that unit's overall health and speed. It's very much like grabbing a new car in <a data-ref-id=\"3025-6\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto\"> Grand Theft Auto</a>. You'll instantly know what to do with whatever you happen to have and at the same time not care too much about what you picked up. While that will suffice for some, if you're going into Battlestations looking for <a data-ref-id=\"3025-16\" href=\"/ace-combat/3025-16/\" slug=\"ace-combat\"> Ace Combat</a> or  <a data-ref-id=\"3025-701\" href=\"/silent-hunter/3025-701/\" slug=\"silent-hunter\"> Silent Hunter</a>-style controls, you will very quickly be disappointed.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/865493-bn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-865493\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/865493-bn.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-865493\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/865493-bn.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The map menu makes it easy to move around a large Navy.</figcaption></figure>Unfortunately, that same ease-of-use versus depth-of-gameplay struggle reappears as soon as you open up Battlestations: Pacific's map view to command your troops. Move here, attack this, and retreat to your carrier are really your only options. While moving your navy around is easy enough, having your boats not run into each other on the way to their target is often harder then you'd think. Thankfully, planes don't seem to have this problem, but since many of the battles involve you navigating through small waterways with a tightly packed fleet of ships, you'll soon get frustrated. Still, in a game that very easily could have gotten out of hand with micro-management, Battlestations: Pacific does a great job of letting you quickly issue orders and move on to the next target opportunity. Actually, the fact that your AI-controlled units are so capable does take some of the fun out of it. A lot of the time the game feels as if you don't need to do much other than point your units in the right direction.</div><br/><div>Battlestations provides a skirmish mode as well as some objective-based multiplayer game types that vary from single-unit deathmatches to full 4v4 island-capture campaigns. The latter are especially fun and while your experience will definitely vary depending upon your team's composition, you can definitely see the more casual strategy elements of the campaign disappear in the face of human opposition. Deciding whether to spread out your navy or keep them tightly packed presents equally viable strategies, and the replayability in these team modes seem pretty deep. With human opponents you'll also notice that aiming for rival ships' individual systems becomes a bit more important, and equal sided confrontations usually are won by whoever can exploit that aiming mechanism. Unfortunately, finding other players seems a little tough, and I'd often sit in waiting rooms for five minutes just to see someone pop in and then quickly pop out.</div><br/><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/865486-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-865486\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/865486-7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-865486\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/865486-7.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/865486-7.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Explosions are especially well done.</figcaption></figure>On the visual front, the game looks very sharp. Clouds are puffy and obscuring. Sun gleams off your plane's windshield and you definitely know when you're approaching shallow water by its transparent shimmer against the shore. Once you get underwater it can get a little barren on the seabed, but the way water splashes against your periscope as you surface more than makes up for it. The sound in Battlestations is equally impressive with a good amount of detail being recognizable between the game's many guns. Varied force feedback from a 360 controller really adds to the feeling and you'll instantly notice the difference between your battleship's main and secondary guns. These small touches, along with modeled cockpits for each and every plane in the game, help offset the overall cartoonish feel of the combat.</div><br/><div>The one place where the audio suffers though is in the game's voice acting. Unfortunately Battlestations' attempts at providing context to the history through short cutscenes during checkpoints and between missions fail miserably. These snippets usually involve gruff caricatures of what a little kid assumes an admiral should sound like. The game's missions carry themselves on their own and bookending such ridiculousness as a scripted butterfly landing on a samurai sword might wear on you. Thankfully, all the cheese is skippable.</div><br/><div>In the end, Battlestations: Pacific is a game you'll likely want to demo before you commit to a purchase. While some will definitely enjoy the sandbox nature of the game and the variety of units it provides, others might be put off by the arcadey gameplay and simplistic strategy. The game provides a decent amount of replayability through its multiplayer modes but it's hard to tell if there are enough gamers online as of this writing to make that a sure thing. Also important to note is that I found that the game plays best with a 360 controller even on the PC version, as switching between a mouse and joystick to get the same control setup can make for a crowded desk. The PC version is Games for Windows Live compatible, so all you achievement-philes should be OK picking either version.</div>", "deck": "Battlestations Pacific provides an epic sense of scale with some unique mission types, but the hybrid nature of its action-strategy gameplay presents a sword that is often dull on both sides.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-158/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20481/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/battlestations-pacific/3030-20481/", "id": 20481, "name": "Battlestations: Pacific"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-05-20 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82382/", "id": 82382, "name": "Battlestations: Pacific"}, "reviewer": "Dave"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/star-trek-d-a-c-review/1900-159/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/960401-dac_as_07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-960401\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.560546875\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/960401-dac_as_07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-960401\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1099/960401-dac_as_07.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You must control the rings.</figcaption></figure>While the world of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-330\" href=\"/star-trek/3025-330/\" slug=\"star-trek\"> Star Trek</a> has always featured a ton of wild, futuristic, high-tech stuff, the core of it all has always been the people. The Star Trek brand has spawned a few pretty good games that remain true to the heart of the series, but it's also churned out some pretty lame stuff over the years. Star Trek: D-A-C, released in concert with this summer's blockbuster film, falls into the \"pretty lame\" category. It's a dull downloadable shooter with a multiplayer focus, sort of like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4576\" href=\"/battlestar-galactica/3030-4576/\" slug=\"battlestar-galactica\"> Battlestar Galactica</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8151\" href=\"/wing-commander-arena/3030-8151/\" slug=\"wing-commander-arena\"> Wing Commander Arena</a>. Unless you're after that kind of top-down action, you definitely don't want any part of this.<br/><br/> Actually, even if top-down multiplayer space shooting sounds like your thing, D-A-C isn't exactly the best of its kind. It offers three team-based modes that pit the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1756\" href=\"/federation/3015-1756/\" slug=\"federation\"> Federation</a> against the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1759\" href=\"/romulan/3015-1759/\" slug=\"romulan\"> Romulans</a>, and each side has three classes of ship. The fighters are small and fast, but don't pack much of a punch and blow up after a scratch or two. The bomber only drops bombs, making it a rear-firing ship that only really comes in handy if you're trying to defend a spot in one of the two objective-based modes. The flagship is the one that looks like the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-7\" href=\"/uss-enterprise-ncc-1701/3055-7/\" slug=\"uss-enterprise-ncc-1701\"> Enterprise</a> (or Nero's ship, if you're a Romulan) and it fires the hardest shots and offers the most hull strength. Unsurprisingly, it's also pretty slow. Maybe it's just the way I play, but I found the fighter and bomber ships to be absolutely worthless.<br/><br/> The game allows up to five ships per side, and you can play offline against artificial opponents, or you can play co-op, which lets multiple humans play on the same machine against AI. Online, as you might expect, lets you play against and with real people in team deathmatch, conquest, and assault modes. Conquest is a control point mode where you must keep your ships in a capture ring to take over the points. When your side controls all the points, the enemy base opens up for capture. Assault mode is similar, but it puts one team on the defensive while another team tries to control a chain of points to open up the enemy base. It's pretty standard stuff that would probably be fine if the game surrounding those modes was any fun.<br/><br/> The main issue is that the game feels totally lifeless. Beyond some nice-looking space backgrounds, D-A-C looks very plain. The explosions and special attack effects aren't great, and the ships turn, bank, and move in weird-looking ways.

There's a very narrow focus on cover-based action here, and while it's got some decent energy to it, the whole thing feels very barebones.</div><div><br/></div><div>That barebones feel starts with the story, which is, well, kind of nonexistent. It's more about basic motivation than character development or specific plotting. You play as <span>John Connor</span>--who, here, looks a bit like a poor-man's <a data-ref-id=\"3005-658\" href=\"/commander-shepard/3005-658/\" slug=\"commander-shepard\">Commander Shepard</a>--and while you're ostensibly on a mission to save a guy named David from something <span>Skynet</span> related, it all boils down to constantly running towards or away from murderous machines.</div><div><br/></div><div>Terminator Salvation is a product of our post-Gears of War world, and it strips that cover-based third-person shooter formula down to its basest elements. The game is, essentially, a series of brief firefights against small packs of those murderous machines. The places that the firefights take place in always seem highly contrived, with bits of cover conveniently scattered, usually in some sort of semicircle configuration, around the area where your enemies will eventually stroll in, hunker down, and start firing away at you.</div><div><br/></div><div>It would seem that, at this point in the Terminator mythology, Skynet hasn't diversified production much, as you'll encounter a whopping six different types of enemies over the course of the game. Probably the most interesting of the bunch are the spidery T-7-Ts, which are too heavily armored for you to take head-on. This requires you to rely on your constant AI companions to distract them as you sneak around by hopping from one piece of cover to the next and blast away at their tender and exposed backsides. It's the most tactical thing you'll do in the game, but the game is generous to a fault with the tactical advantages. There's always ample ammo, you're regularly given the higher ground over your enemies, and the machines very rarely stray outside of their designated attack areas.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1032196-picture_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1032196\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.61805555555556\" data-width=\"576\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1032196-picture_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1032196\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1032196-picture_3.png\"></a><figcaption>These rubber-skinned T600s are as close to Arnold as the game gets.</figcaption></figure>There's something actually enjoyable to the constant-cover philosophy at work here. Part of it comes from the fact that John Connor looks pretty awesome sliding and rolling from one piece of cover to the next. They're much more dynamic-looking than most of his animations, which look kind of pinched. His run animation specifically makes him look like he's constantly looking for the bathroom. There's also a semi-circular on-screen guide that shows up when you're behind cover, which makes the process of moving from one piece of cover to another feel very intuitive. For as derivative as most of the action in Terminator Salvation is, this little trick struck me as something that other Gears of War-style games could benefit from.</div><div><br/></div><div>The individual firefights can be fun, but the game never lets itself build up any momentum. Almost every enemy encounter takes place in a small, contained area, and they're usually bookended by a short cutscene. There are numerous sequences where you'll literally walk from one cutscene to another, without any action in between. The game mixes things up with the occasional on-rails sequence--you'll man a turret in the backs of trucks, subway trains, and dune buggies--but these are even simpler and more straightforward than the rest of the game.</div><div><br/></div><div>In addition to not offering a terrific amount of variety, Terminator Salvation is a short experience, too. Playing on the normal difficulty, it took me a little under five hours to see the credits roll. There's no real reason to revisit the game once you're done, either. There's a split-screen coop mode, but no online option, and both the PS3 trophies and the Xbox 360 achievements are based entirely on\u00a0clearing the individual chapters. If you play it on the hard difficulty, you can get everything in a single play-through.</div><div><br/></div><div>Terminator Salvation ultimately just feels too small for a $60 game. Even the environments, which consist mostly of war-torn streets and boxy, brownish interiors, give you little sense that there's a world outside of the path that you're on. It's not a bad experience, but what it offers is so simple that it would feel repetitive if it were any longer.\u00a0As it is, it doesn't do enough to justify a purchase.</div>", "deck": "It's not a poorly made game, but Terminator Salvation is too simple and too fleeting to recommend.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-160/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24514/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/terminator-salvation/3030-24514/", "id": 24514, "name": "Terminator Salvation"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-05-21 20:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83853/", "id": 83853, "name": "Terminator Salvation"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/infamous-review/1900-161/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1030533-hero_screen_and_depth_46_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030533\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1030533-hero_screen_and_depth_46_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030533\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1030533-hero_screen_and_depth_46_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's a lot of city out there to save.</figcaption></figure>Let's go ahead and get <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20599\" href=\"/infamous/3030-20599/\" slug=\"infamous\">InFamous</a>' short list of downsides out of the way. Technically, the game is a little rough around the edges; occasional frame rate and draw-in issues and some questionable character animation make it look slightly less impressive than what you'd want from a PlayStation 3 exclusive. It's a little on the hard side in the first few hours, before you start building up your wild electrical superpowers and you can really fight back against the large number of enemies the game throws at you. Oh, and I guess your portly sidekick Zeke is kind of annoying from time to time.</div><div><br/></div><div>OK, now that those minor complaints are out of the way, I can spend the rest of the review talking about how much fun I had blasting, zapping, climbing, and flying around the big urban comic book world <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3899\" href=\"/sucker-punch/3010-3899/\" slug=\"sucker-punch\">Sucker Punch</a> created for this game.</div><div><br/></div><div>InFamous really is a comic book transposed into the video game format. It even starts out with a quick, outlandish origin story: You're bike messenger <span>Cole McGrath</span>, delivering a routine package that turns out to be a mysterious, unusual bomb. After unwittingly leveling half of Empire City, you wake up in the smoldering crater with the sudden ability to control electricity and use it as a weapon. You'll need all the help you can get, because the city is placed under quarantine as a plague ravages the survivors and a bunch of gangs terrorize the populace. It's clear the government isn't coming to help anytime soon, so Cole has to step up and try to make a difference amidst all the madness.</div><div><br/></div><div>In the wake of the bomb, there are a bunch of other comic book-style villains and supporting characters coloring up the ruins of Empire City. There's a frail,\u00a0embittered\u00a0old man with\u00a0telekinetic powers; a freaky telepathic lady with some serious jealousy issues; your aforementioned chubby friend Zeke; your now <span class=\"Apple-style-span\" style=\"font-style:italic; \">ex</span>-girlfriend who blames you for blowing up her sister along with half the city's residents; a mysterious Illuminati-esque organization which may or may not have engineered the blast; and, of course, the shadowy, hooded, mechanical-armed figure who's actually pulling all the strings.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1030531-hero_screen_and_depth_18_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030531\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1030531-hero_screen_and_depth_18_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030531\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1030531-hero_screen_and_depth_18_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The electric powers are a ton of fun to use.</figcaption></figure>I was worried the story would get a little boilerplate (it is a video game, after all), but it throws several major twists at you in the second half that really ratchet up the pace and make you want to keep playing to find out what the heck is going on. It helps that the cutscenes, which are presented like an animated graphic novel, are really slick and well-produced.</div><div><br/></div><div>Even if the story was trite or nonexistent, though, the quality of the action would be enough to carry InFamous. The speed and feel of the movement, aiming, firing, dodging, climbing, and jumping has a looseness and fluidity that makes the game extremely satisfying to play. Navigating the urban environment is also a pleasure; Cole automatically grabs for ledges and handholds, allowing him to make his way up building faces, lampposts, and just about any other city feature with ease, so you can get around as easily as you can dish out your attacks.</div><div><br/></div><div>The brilliant controls work with the array of superpowers at your disposal--which mostly mimic established shooter archetypes like grenades, rocket launchers, and sniper rifles, and a few borrowed from Star Wars like a kinetic push and a ground slam--to make it incredibly satisfying to use all your destructive tools against the game's many enemies. There are almost endless ways to combine the many powers together dynamically in a big firefight; it's enough to keep the combat totally engaging till the end of the game, especially since you get access to new powers at regular intervals right up to the last few missions.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1030530-hero_screen_and_depth_14_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030530\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1030530-hero_screen_and_depth_14_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1030530\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1030530-hero_screen_and_depth_14_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1030530-hero_screen_and_depth_14_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Your decisions influence what kinds of powers you have.</figcaption></figure>You earn experience points for just about everything you do in the game, from stylish enemy takedowns to healing injured civilians, and you can cash these in on numerous upgrades for each power that follow one of two paths, depending on your moral alignment. Stop me if you've heard this one before, but the game presents choices throughout the storyline that lets you play Cole as a good or evil character. Some of the choices seem a little contrived, while some make more sense in context; all of them are explicitly outlined to you by voiceover right before you get to decide, so there's never any mystery about what your options are. You'll probably want to stick to a single alignment throughout a single playthrough, since there are three levels of both good and evil karma to upgrade through.</div><div><br/></div><div>Anyway, in practical terms your alignment primarily determines which upgrades you have access to. The powers all have three upgrades, one for each karma level, and each subsequent upgrade adds some kind of damage boost, extra effect, or modifier, making it well worth maxing out as many of them as you can. The good versions of the powers focus on restraining enemies without killing them and minimizing civilian casualties, while the evil powers are all about big, wanton destruction.\u00a0Your alignment also makes your electricity blue or red, but it doesn't have much bearing on the storyline--other than a couple of minor points, and the way the populace reacts to you--so if you don't have any moral hangups, you can tailor your choices to the sort of weapons you'd like to use. Both styles are fun to play, just in different ways.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/944052-034_boss_big_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944052\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/944052-034_boss_big_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-944052\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/944052-034_boss_big_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/944052-034_boss_big_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are some crazy, bigger-than-life characters in here.</figcaption></figure>Empire City is a big open world with three distinctive islands, so like Grand Theft Auto or any of its innumerable ilk, you're free to approach the core story missions and a number of side activities with some flexibility. A few side missions are only available to either good or evil characters, and there are enough different types of objectives that I never got tired of doing side missions, until I reached the end of the game and realized I'd actually done all of them. (It helps that side missions net you a lot of experience points.) The same goes for the game's collectibles; I kept getting derailed from the storyline to climb around looking for blast shards (numbering in the hundreds) and \"dead drops,\" or audio recordings wired into satellite dishes (around three dozen). These collectibles have actual purpose, since the shards increase your charge capacity (essentially your ammo), and the dead drops fill in background story elements by playing back the audio logs of a missing secret government agent who's been working the Empire City case since long before the blast.</div><div><br/></div><div>Aside from the minor technical issues, there are a lot of good things to say about InFamous' presentation. The city is densely packed and nicely designed with a variety of different building styles (which is nice, since you see them up-close so frequently). In lieu of a repeating day-to-night cycle, I like that the story is broken up into specific days with preset weather and lighting conditions, so the visual backdrop can work to help set the tone of the story. The music is great and has a really gritty, urban feel to it with a lot of driving percussion; I just wish you got to hear more of it. It's a nicely produced package, overall.</div><div><br/></div><div>But it's the quality of the central action in InFamous that I keep coming back to. Everything else would be fancy window dressing if Sucker Punch hadn't nailed the basic gameplay elements, the simple moving and shooting, as precisely as it did.\u00a0InFamous feels like a game designed from the very ground up to be fun to play, so I guess it's no surprise that as soon as the credits finished rolling on my good version of Cole, I started up an evil one to play it all over again.</div>", "deck": "Dynamic, pinpoint-precise combat and a sprawling urban landscape define this great open-world action game from Sucker Punch.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-161/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20599/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/infamous/3030-20599/", "id": 20599, "name": "inFamous"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-05-22 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73977/", "id": 73977, "name": "inFamous"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/raiden-fighters-aces-review/1900-162/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1016906-img004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1016906\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4501510574018\" data-width=\"331\" style=\"width: 331px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:145.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1016906-img004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1016906\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/976/1016906-img004.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Your little ship can totally decimate that big one if you just keep shooting.</figcaption></figure>Raiden Fighters Aces collects and emulates three top-down, vertically scrolling arcade shooters and ships them out at a budget price. The three games comprise the Raiden Fighters series, starting with the <span>original 1996</span> arcade game, its 1997 sequel, and Raiden Fighters Jet, originally a 1998 release. These are all pretty good shooters, and the game offers enough different options and modes to ensure that the collection can appeal to players of all skill levels.</div><div><br/></div><div>The game boots to a menu, where you can tinker around with display options and choose which of the three games you'd like to play. The visual options are fairly detailed, letting you adjust the size of the game screen, rotate the view (in case you've got a sideways TV), turn on and adjust scanlines, and so on. Once you've selected a game, you're presented with another menu where you can adjust the difficulty and play in a few different modes. The difficulty adjustments are pretty key and make a huge difference. For example, when you set the game to practice mode, the enemies don't fire back. That makes it (and most of its <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21341\" href=\"/raiden-fighters-aces/3030-21341/achievements/\" slug=\"raiden-fighters-aces\">achievements</a>) pretty easy. If you turn on expert mode, enemies explode into a cloud of bullets. That makes it, well, quite a bit harder. You can set the number of continues, replay for a higher score, or practice specific sections to get them down just right. When you're done playing, you can save recordings of your performance for later viewing.</div><div><br/></div><div>The games themselves are fairly iconic vertical shooters that don't change that dramatically from one game to the next. Each one lets you pick from a variety of different ships that have different weapon systems, but the main upgrade path has you choosing between collecting missile power-ups or laser upgrades. Typically, the lasers home in on their targets. The games have a lot of tanks and jets to blow up along the way, but they're also focused pretty heavily on boss battles against huge war machines that spew bullets and take a real pounding before going up in flames. Each game isn't terribly long on its own, but provided you're playing on a difficulty setting that puts up a fight, it won't be a total breeze, either. Even on its hardest setting, none of the games delve into <a data-ref-id=\"3015-321\" href=\"/bullet-hell/3015-321/\" slug=\"bullet-hell\">bullet hell</a> territory, which helps make them feel like games you might actually be able to complete without being some sort of twitchy superhuman.</div><div><br/></div><div>At $19.99, Raiden Fighters Aces compares favorably to the standard Xbox Live Arcade pricing structure, where each one of these three games would probably run $10. So if you have a hankering for this type of classic scrolling shooter gameplay, Raiden Fighters Aces is a strong package that you'll certainly enjoy.</div>", "deck": "If you're the type of person who can appreciate arcade shooters of the 1990s, this budget-priced collection will certainly satisfy.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-162/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21341/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/raiden-fighters-aces/3030-21341/", "id": 21341, "name": "Raiden Fighters Aces"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-05-26 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82510/", "id": 82510, "name": "Raiden Fighters Aces"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/boom-blox-bash-party-review/1900-163/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22263/874710-bbbp_space_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874710\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22263/874710-bbbp_space_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-874710\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22263/874710-bbbp_space_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>We like the blox, the blox that... yeah.</figcaption></figure>It's taken some time for third-party developers to really capitalize on all the strengths of the Nintendo Wii, and last year's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20466\" href=\"/boom-blox/3030-20466/\" slug=\"boom-blox\"> Boom Blox</a> still stands as one of the finest examples of a third party really nailing it. The simple concept of knocking over blocks was broadly accessible, the motion controls were satisfyingly tactile, and the boxy, playful presentation even made the best of the Wii's relatively limited technical horsepower. There were a few issues with level design and the overall flow of the game, but it was still a great eight-to-eighty kind of experience. Almost exactly a year later EA's got a sequel with Boom Blox Bash Party, a game that does pretty much what the last game did, only better. There's more levels, new gameplay mechanics, better online, and even if the new stuff is a little hit and miss, the package has been generally refined to make it easier to get to the stuff you like.<br/><br/> Like the original, Bash Party is fundamentally still a big physics-based toy that taps into the primal satisfaction of breaking stuff but without any consequence. It generally doesn't take too long to get a hang of the controls, and when you do, it's basically electronic bubble wrap. Using the Wii Remote, you'll chuck balls at towers of blocks (or is it blox?) yank the blocks out  Jenga-style, blast them apart with cannons, or use the new slingshot mechanic to knock them around. The slingshot stuff isn't my favorite, mostly because it requires you to move forward and back with the remote to line up your shot and determine how much power you put behind it. It's a motion that has never felt right to me on the Wii, so the slingshot suffers for it. That's more than made up for, though, by the new color-matching mechanic, which gives you different colored balls that you can toss to change the colors of blocks. If three blocks of the same color make contact in any configuration, they'll disappear. It's an age-old puzzle-game conceit that Bash Party injects with some physics-based chaos, and the game ends up getting a lot of mileage out of this concept.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/970393-bbbp_create_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-970393\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/970393-bbbp_create_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-970393\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/970393-bbbp_create_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's a ton of levels in here, and you can make your own and download others, too.</figcaption></figure>How you actually got to all the fun stuff was kind of an issue in Boom Blox. It was structured in such a way that you often had to bang your head against levels that were either too tough or that you just didn't like in order to get access to the next cool toy. Bash Party is structured in a similar, but modified fashion. The game is split up into single-player, co-op, and competitive levels, and within each of these sets, you're presented with a theme park map, where each of the themed areas represent a different set of levels. There's a pirate theme, a space theme, a superhero theme, and others, though they're not just for looks, with underwater and space levels that affect how the physics of the blocks behave. Like Boom Blox, you have to meet certain win conditions on earlier levels to advance to later ones. But, if you find yourself stuck in Bash Party, you can use the Boom Bux that you accumulate from clearing levels to buy your way through. It kind of feels like a cheat, but it works.\u00a0<br/><br/> At the bottom of just about every menu screen in Bash Party, there's a satellite icon that you can hit to connect to EA's online level repository, where users can share levels they've built using the game's own level editor. The online stuff is ridiculously simple and fast, and since there's no direct online interaction with other players, it's able to bypass any friend codes or credentials--just hit the button, and you're there. You can sort through the available levels in a number of different ways, and the actual levels are incredibly small so there's virtually no waiting when you find one you want to play. If you find a level that you like, you can save it locally, and even take it into the game's level editor and tweak it. There's a decent amount of stuff on the server right now, some of it produced by EA, though it's tough to say if it'll get the same community toehold as something like LittleBigPlanet in the long run. Still, even with no actual multiplayer, I'm really impressed with how smart the online in Bash Party is.<br/><br/> It's not a massive change, but it's worth noting how the look of Boom Blox has evolved with Bash Party. It still mostly looks like a theme park filled with cuboid animals, but the art has gotten a little weirder and a little darker. It's kind of a junior-high-to-high-school or comic-book-to-graphic-novel type of shift, but it's noticeable.<br/><br/> Even though it's a categorically better game, Bash Party doesn't benefit from the exciting kick of such a fresh idea that the original Boom Blox did.

In this case, the ability to destroy raises Red Faction: Guerrilla up from being a fairly standard open-world game with plain-jane missions and scattered optional tasks into something really special. When you round it out with an interesting Martian theme and factor in the game's solid multiplayer, the end result comes out feeling mostly great.<br/><br/> Guerrilla is the third game in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-399\" href=\"/red-faction/3025-399/\" slug=\"red-faction\"> Red Faction</a> line, and it's the first one to be released in quite some time. It opens with you, as miner <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9526\" href=\"/alec-mason/3005-9526/\" slug=\"alec-mason\"> Alec Mason</a>, arriving on <a data-ref-id=\"3035-4\" href=\"/mars/3035-4/\" slug=\"mars\"> Mars</a> to see your brother and put in some good, honest work. Before too long, your brother is dead and you've been sucked into a brewing rebellion with the rest of the Red Faction. The reds are fighting against the EDF--that's the Earth Defense Force--who seems to be pretty good at oppressing the labor class on Mars. Seeing as how they just gunned down your brother and you've narrowly avoided being their next victim, you quickly join up and start taking on tasks to slowly disrupt the EDF's control.<br/><br/> That control is region-based, with each region of Mars offering a number of tasks that can lower the level of control that the EDF has over a sector while also raising the morale of the people, inspiring them to fight at your side should you find yourself in a public battle. The control level is what gets you to accomplish side tasks, as you won't be able to liberate a region without first lowering the level of control below a certain threshold. Doing so unlocks the final mission for a region, which liberates it and moves the story forward to a new area. Most of the story missions are straightforward, though some of the longer ones start slow and end frantically. While the longer missions provide checkpoints, there were a couple of cases where I wished they had one a little closer to the tricky part.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/957200-09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-957200\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/957200-09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-957200\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/957200-09.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are plenty of ways to blow things up on Mars.</figcaption></figure>The side missions in Red Faction: Guerrilla are broken up into categories, and each area has a few of each type. For me, the most interesting and fun missions were the ones where you ride around in a turret on the back of a car and have to destroy a bunch of EDF property while protecting your vehicle from damage. This one's great because it plays right into the game's destructive strengths. Others, like having to drive a car from point A to point B before time expires, or another that has you rescuing hostages from trigger-happy troops and returning them to safety, are decidedly less exciting. Here's another note for you completists out there. Upon finishing the 20 main story missions, the game dumps you back into the world and lets you clean up any remaining business, like side missions or finding collectibles. But it also makes many of those remaining missions harder than they would be normally. So you'll have an easier time if you completely clear out each sector one by one before liberating them.<br/><br/> Even though a lot of the single-player stuff in Red Faction: Guerrilla sounds a little boilerplate on its own, the end result is still a fairly exciting campaign. You'll purchase enough weapons and upgrades along the way to keep the new stuff coming, and there are enough side mission types around that you're almost guaranteed to enjoy at least one of them--and you don't need to do too many of them before unlocking an area's final mission. So it rarely feels like you're grinding it out just to move on. The weapons are satisfying and, well, you blow up tons of buildings along the way. It's the inclusion of a robust physics model that makes destroying structures so much fun. Everything behaves roughly as you'd expect, so taking out key points of a bridge's foundation, for example, is much more effective than just grabbing your hammer and punching random holes in the bridge itself. Seeing buildings collapse and watching smokestacks crumble, often falling onto other structures on their way down, is the game's most exciting feature.<br/><br/> Blowing things up is a key component of the game's offline multiplayer, a pass-and-play mode called wrecking crew. There are multiple minigames to play here, and all of them are centered on you taking one weapon into a small cluster of buildings and blowing them apart. Some give you limited time to blow up as much as possible, others give you limited ammo to force you to make every shot do as much damage as possible, and so on. It's a great showpiece for the game's destructible structures.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176452-emag_redfactionguerrilla_040408_7_afd50.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176452\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/24/176452-emag_redfactionguerrilla_040408_7_afd50.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-176452\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/176452-emag_redfactionguerrilla_040408_7_afd50.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/24/176452-emag_redfactionguerrilla_040408_7_afd50.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Oh yeah, there are also walkers. They don't move fast, but they tear up everything in their path.</figcaption></figure>There's also a full-on competitive online multiplayer mode with <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2\" href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" slug=\"halo\"> Halo</a>-style matchmaking. I'm of the mind that most open-world games that have tried to include competitive multiplayer haven't really worked out so well, so I have to admit that I was pretty surprised by Red Faction: Guerrilla. The multiplayer strips away the open world of the single-player in favor of tighter, more focused maps. The weapons from the single-player appear in some form, and you can also wear various backpacks that give you special abilities. The <a data-ref-id=\"3055-6\" href=\"/jet-pack/3055-6/\" slug=\"jet-pack\"> jet pack</a> from the single-player game appears, as well as things like a vision pack that lets you see enemies through walls. Or a fleetfoot pack that makes you run super-fast when triggered. Or a stealth pack that makes you mostly invisible for short periods of time. I especially enjoyed the rhino pack, which unleashes a powerful forward charge when triggered, busting through walls in the process. The weapons, backpacks, and demolition-friendly buildings make the multiplayer modes--a mostly standard set of deathmatch, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-25\" href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" slug=\"capture-the-flag\"> capture the flag</a>, and other objective-based options--a lot of fun. The game also gives you a steady stream of unlockable characters and other objects as you gain online experience.<br/><br/> While there are clunky bits at the fringes of Red Faction: Guerrilla that give it a handful of frustrating or disappointing moments, the core moments of the game are exciting and well-conceived. Factor in a thrilling multiplayer component and the sheer satisfaction provided by the wholesale destruction of huge structures and you've got more than enough reasons to get your ass to Mars.", "deck": "Who knew that blowing apart buildings, bridges, and other Martian structures could be so satisfying?", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-164/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21125/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/red-faction-guerrilla/3030-21125/", "id": 21125, "name": "Red Faction: Guerrilla"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-06-09 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73895/", "id": 73895, "name": "Red Faction: Guerrilla"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/prototype-review/1900-165/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899438-military_angers_alex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899438\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/899438-military_angers_alex.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-899438\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/899438-military_angers_alex.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Stepping to a walking supervirus is ill-advised.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3010-2249\" href=\"/radical-entertainment-inc/3010-2249/\" slug=\"radical-entertainment-inc\"> Radical Entertainment</a> surprised a lot of people on the last generation of consoles with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19865\" href=\"/the-incredible-hulk-ultimate-destruction/3030-19865/\" slug=\"the-incredible-hulk-ultimate-destruction\"> The Incredible Hulk: Ultimate Destruction</a>, an over-the-top open-world take on  Marvel's green-skinned beast that let you do things like hurl city buses directly into helicopters. Now Radical is back on modern hardware with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4209\" href=\"/prototype/3030-4209/\" slug=\"prototype\"> Prototype</a>, which is basically the same game as Ultimate Destruction with an original (still comic book-like) storyline and a startling number of new combat abilities bolted onto the existing framework. Radical almost went <i>too</i> far with its kitchen-sink approach to combat design, but the gameplay here is satisfying and broad enough that you can have plenty of fun with it even without mastering the nuances of every last combo and attack.<br/><br/> You can soar over the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1613\" href=\"/manhattan/3035-1613/\" slug=\"manhattan\"> Manhattan</a> skyline and hoist tanks over your head in this game, so it's tempting to stick Prototype in the \"superhero\" category. But there's really nothing heroic about the protagonist <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3056\" href=\"/alex-mercer/3005-3056/\" slug=\"alex-mercer\"> Alex Mercer</a>. He's patient zero at the center of a horrendous, engineered viral outbreak that's turned most of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-109\" href=\"/new-york/3035-109/\" slug=\"new-york\"> New York City</a> into a quarantined hellhole. Post-infection, every district is occupied by hideous monsters or the military trying to quell them--and unfortunately, both sides are out for your head. Luckily, the infection has turned you into a one-man bio-army capable of bashing, slashing, and demolishing your way through just about any obstacle.<br/><br/> Mercer is on a quest to find out who inflicted this curse on him--and then exact vengeance--and he doesn't care who he hurts in the process. No shades of moral gray here; you'll unavoidably (almost gleefully) massacre hundreds of civilians and military personnel with your newfound powers as you follow the trail of evidence and approach the slightly convoluted truth of what brought about all this madness. The storyline is a little disjointed and the cutscenes a bit clumsy--and both of them intrude on the action more frequently than I would have liked--but they do a decent enough job of moving you from mission to mission, where the game's real value is.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/912946-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-912946\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/912946-12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-912946\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/912946-12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The number of combat moves you can pull off feels almost endless.</figcaption></figure>Name a type of gameplay, and odds are Prototype has it covered. There's combo-based melee. Lock-on shooting. Vehicular combat. Urban free-running. Disguises and stealth. You'd expect a genetic superman like Mercer to be able to do just about anything, but the game almost--<i>almost</i>--collapses under the sheer volume of options available to you during combat. The upgrades screen includes dozens of abilities spread across numerous pages, and not only did I get nowhere close to unlocking them all during my first playthrough, but I didn't even think to use all of the powers and moves I <i>did</i> get access to. The number of button combinations you'd need to remember and bust out on the fly to utilize every last ability is too overwhelming for them all to be useful concurrently while you're in the thick of the game's often dizzying action.<br/><br/> The good news is that you don't really <i>need</i> to use every last ability to enjoy Prototype's outrageous combat, since the game does a good job of making the various styles of gameplay blend together so you can easily pull off a lot of cool, flashy combos. You might glide over a battalion of troops, ground-slam into their midst, grab a dropped rocket launcher, leap a hundred feet into the air, and fire it multiple times at a tank before hitting the ground, then grabbing the burning husk of that tank over your head and flinging it into a group of soldiers. Or you could run straight up the face of a skyscraper, jump kick a helicopter, then remove the pilots from their seats and take control of the chopper to lay waste to a group of mutated monsters before hitting the ground and unleashing your tentacle-like mutant appendages on the survivors in a series of whirling combos. The game doesn't nail any one area of the combat as well as it could have if the developer had focused the game's scope more tightly, but it's hard not to be impressed by the sheer range and audacity of things Mercer can do, and the wild scenarios these powers can create.<br/><br/> That's all once you get past the slightly daunting learning curve, that is--and even then, the game will throw you a curveball here and there. Prepare to be frustrated from time to time when the mission difficulty amps up to insane levels and you feel it's you against the entire world all of a sudden. There are ways to mitigate the onslaught, things like consuming enemies for health and unleashing last-ditch \"devastator\" moves, but from time to time you'll likely feel like you missed grabbing an essential weapon or making a critical jump because of some overly long animation or camera-angle quirk. In general, you'll need to master all the ins and outs of the high-flying movement and various survival techniques to get through the tougher missions without throwing your controller at a wall. You might end up doing that anyway, but when you do get good at juggling all your abilities, the combat is quite rewarding and hard to resist coming back to even when it gets a little abusive.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/912934-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-912934\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.563\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/912934-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-912934\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/912934-2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3009/912934-2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game's version of New York is sparse but functional.</figcaption></figure>Outside Prototype's 30 story missions, there's a good number of side activities to engage in that will net you experience points to buy more upgrades with. The optional missions mostly focus on arbitrary challenges like \"kill a bunch of people with this specific power in three minutes\" or \"use your glide powers to land in the middle of this target.\" In other words, they don't tie into the storyline or add any color to the game world, though you do have a good couple hundred people who make up the \"web of intrigue\" that you can track down. By killing them and absorbing their memories, you can fill in brief video vignettes that fill in small bits of the events that led up to the current outbreak. I wish Radical had put more effort into making the game's version of New York feel livelier; the streets are full of screaming citizens and traffic jams ripe for destruction at the appropriate moments, but otherwise there's not a lot of personality hiding between the game's generic-looking skyscrapers.<br/><br/> Prototype is really all about player empowerment, ramping up the number and intensity of larger-than-life superhero abilities consistently as you go.

Conceptually I find this whole package incredibly appealing, though in practice, the game is hampered by performance issues, lots of recycled Rock Band songs, and the lack of any social aspect. So yeah, it's got issues, but it still capably captures much of the Rock Band feel, and it's still fun to play.<br/><br/> When you first load it up, it's immediately apparent that this is Rock Band. The menus retain those distinctive psychedelic hues, and even though the texture quality and the number of polygons has been noticeably reduced, it's still a clean, sharp-looking game. The focus of the game is primarily on the world tour mode which, aside from its diminished scope, is nearly indistinguishable from the console version. You're still trotting the globe, playing gigs to earn money, fans, and stars, and unlock bigger and better transportation options and support staff. The key difference, and this is something that penetrates down into the core of the gameplay, is that rather than being a member of the band, you <i>are</i> the band. When you create your band, you'll choose the name and the look of all four band members, and you use the money you earn to buy new gear and clothes for the whole group. The whole creation/customization element in Unplugged doesn't go as deep as it does in a full-blown Rock Band game, with fewer things to customize and fewer ways to customize them. On the other hand, you've got a four-piece of rock dolls to play dress-up with, instead of just one person.<br/><br/> Whether or not you've played Rock Band, there's going to be a little learning curve to Unplugged, since you're now playing all four instruments on a song instead of just one. You're still hitting buttons in time with notes as they scroll down the screen--multiplied by a factor of four. This probably sounds crazy, but the game makes it manageable by essentially auto-playing an instrument for a while after you play a section without making any mistakes, allowing you to switch over to another instrument. To pull this off flawlessly, you need to not only be aware of when the track you're playing will clear out--something that the game highlights with an extra-large note at the end--but which track you need to play next. The four instrument tracks are lined up side-by-side, which means that you'll often have to quickly hop over a track or two before getting to the right one. It can be manic, and if you don't get to the track you need to clear on time, or if you just make a mistake, it can feel like it's taking <i>forever</i> for the next eligible section to scroll down.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/955116-img0085.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-955116\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/955116-img0085.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-955116\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/955116-img0085.jpg\"></a><figcaption>I'm pretty sure this is the only time a one-man band has even been remotely cool.</figcaption></figure>But even with the added track-juggling stuff and the lack of instrument controllers, Rock Band Unplugged still taps into that sensation that you are really playing these songs, like some kind of one-man, headphone karaoke. The note patterns on medium were a little sparse for my tastes, but playing on hard, I found it to be really satisfying and enjoyably challenging. It's unfortunate, then, that the frame rate in Unplugged occasionally stumbles. Most of the time everything is moving smoothly enough that it seems fine, but once you get a lot of notes on screen, and you switch on the score-multiplying overdrive effect, things get crazy choppy. A solid frame rate is one of the most critical things for a rhythm game, and it's disappointing that Unplugged doesn't quite nail it.<br/><br/> The track listing may be another sticking point for some folks. With a few, wonderful exceptions--like Jackson 5's \"ABC\"--the music is a mix of songs from the main Rock Band games and DLC. It's a lively, interesting mix of music, but if you've played a lot of Rock Band, there's a good possibility that you're already kind of worn out on a lot of the songs in Unplugged. If you're looking for more music, there's a PSP-specific music store built into Unplugged. There are ten songs in the PSP music store as of this writing, and Harmonix has promised more in the future, but my issue here is that of value. Currently, all the songs being offered are $1.99 a pop, same as you'd pay for most regular Rock Band DLC. I understand that Harmonix still has to spend the time mapping out note paths for all four instruments, and the licensing fees are probably no different, but it's harder for me to justify two bucks for a song when I can't even play it with my friends.<br/><br/> It's an imperfect package, but even the sporadic frame rate chop and well-worn track list couldn't conspire to keep me from really enjoying most of my time with Rock Band Unplugged. There aren't many rhythm games on the PSP, but this is easily the most satisfying experience I've had with the genre on the PSP, warts and all.", "deck": "Rock Band miniaturizes onto the PSP better than you might think, though Unplugged is brought down by technical issues and an overly familiar track listing.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-166/", "platforms": "PlayStation Portable", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25421/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/rock-band-unplugged/3030-25421/", "id": 25421, "name": "Rock Band Unplugged"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-06-17 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82667/", "id": 82667, "name": "Rock Band Unplugged"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rocket-riot-review/1900-167/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/921980-rr_x3f_goldenguy_multiplayer1_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921980\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/921980-rr_x3f_goldenguy_multiplayer1_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921980\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/921980-rr_x3f_goldenguy_multiplayer1_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are a bunch of different level themes, including pirate ships, haunted houses, warehouses, and more.</figcaption></figure>Rocket Riot looks and sounds like some kind of downloadable remake to a cult Amiga game that never existed. It seems like the remake of the sort of game that your closest British friend constantly pesters you about, chastising you for not being up on how popular the Amiga and the C64 were in the UK. That's not to say that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6668\" href=\"/codeglue/3010-6668/\" slug=\"codeglue\"> Codeglue</a>'s Xbox Live Arcade game really has anything in common with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19858\" href=\"/paradroid/3030-19858/\" slug=\"paradroid\"> Paradroid</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19165\" href=\"/sensible-world-of-soccer/3030-19165/\" slug=\"sensible-world-of-soccer\"> Sensible Soccer</a>. But it's just the general vibe I get from this fun, cool-looking <a data-ref-id=\"3055-6\" href=\"/jet-pack/3055-6/\" slug=\"jet-pack\"> jet-pack</a>-based shooter.<br/><br/> The shorter version of an already short story is that a legless pirate escapes captivity and steals everyone's legs. Scientists come up with a jet pack that screws to your ass, and... you know what? It doesn't matter. The story pops up between segments in the single-player mode and serves as a cute little diversion that doesn't get in the way.<br/><br/> There's a whimsical art style to Rocket Riot that also gives the game a very light-hearted feel. In-game, everything has a blocky, pixelated look, but the camera perspective bends just enough to let you see that these are fully polygonal characters, not flat 2D sprites. As a little dude with a jet pack and a rocket launcher, you can fly around the game's blocky environments at will, popping off missiles in any direction with the right stick. While that technically makes the game a dual-joystick shooter, you have to cock the rockets back a bit by holding the right stick in a direction if you want to get the most movement out of them. Gravity takes hold after that, so you're firing a lot of arcing shots, forcing you to adjust your aim to compensate on longer shots. That concept--aiming your arcing shots to score hits--is the core of Rocket Riot. It feels right, with just enough control over your aim and how hard you launch your rockets to make the whole thing feel like second nature after an hour or two with the game.<br/><br/> Of course, there's a bit more to the gameplay than boosting around and firing rockets. Rocket Riot has a collection of power-ups to collect, like homing missiles, bigger rockets, faster rockets, a shield, one that repels incoming fire, one that makes you smaller and harder to hit, and so on. Furthermore, there are a bunch of different rulesets that come up in the single-player game. Most of the time you just need to kill a number of enemies to proceed. But some have you digging around through the blocks in search of a specific character. Or eliminating marked sets of blocks while fending off enemy attacks. Or another that has you grab a football and drag it over to a set of goalposts to score. The single-player mode also has boss fights that put you up against a bigger, more resilient opponent.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/921990-rrscreen2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921990\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/921990-rrscreen2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-921990\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/921990-rrscreen2.png\"></a><figcaption>Most levels simply ask you to destroy everyone who gets in your way.</figcaption></figure>In multiplayer, the game lets you enter into standard deathmatches, or other modes like Golden Guy, where you attempt to grab a gold suit and survive for as long as possible while wearing it. Or Rugby Riot, which uses the same sort of ball rules as the single-player. Of course, playing against human opposition is way more exciting than playing any of the other modes, both because humans tend to be a bit smarter and because having opponents that don't die in one hit makes you have to think a bit more.<br/><br/> The only real downer about Rocket Riot is that it does begin to get repetitive when playing offline. Most of the levels are brainless battles against dopey enemies that rarely shoot straight, and the game types you'll see in each 10-level cycle tend to be identical. Plus, there don't seem to be too many people playing the game online at the moment, especially if you're looking for something other than a standard deathmatch. Of course, the game launched immediately after some Xbox Live technical issues, so it's hard to say how the player base will change over time.<br/><br/> With that in mind, you should know that Rocket Riot will eventually wear thin. But its great looks, clever gameplay, and huge roster of unlockable characters give you plenty to do, and the end result is quite a bit better than the game's $10 price tag might initially lead you to believe.

But is that enough?</figcaption></figure>Ghostbusters: The Video Game belongs to a rare strain of movie tie-in video games. Rather than serving as an expensive marketing bauble for a new theatrical release, this game--alongside titles like  <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13540\" href=\"/the-godfather-the-game/3030-13540/\" slug=\"the-godfather-the-game\"> The Godfather: The Game</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9966\" href=\"/scarface-the-world-is-yours/3030-9966/\" slug=\"scarface-the-world-is-yours\"> Scarface: The World Is Yours</a>--is designed to mine the longstanding affection for a long-dormant film franchise. As mercenary as that might sound, the involvement of the original writers and the good majority of the original cast made it sound like this might actually offer an authentic Ghostbusters experience, and for the most part, it does. The game is absolutely bursting at the seams with details that only a line-quoting Ghostbusters fan would notice and appreciate, and the story itself goes to great lengths to incorporate major aspects of the Ghostbusters fiction. That heavy emphasis on nostalgia can't completely distract from the game's dearth of actual laughs, or the repetitious, scuffed-up feel of the gameplay.\u00a0<br/><br/> Taking place a few years after the events of <i>Ghostbusters II</i>, Ghostbusters: The Video Game puts you in the role of a nameless, mute new recruit who's been brought on as an \"Experimental Equipment Technician,\" which is another way of saying \"your  <a data-ref-id=\"3055-234\" href=\"/proton-pack/3055-234/\" slug=\"proton-pack\"> proton pack</a> has all kinds of new tricks.\" Right off the bat, you're hanging in the firehouse with the boys, listening to Janine take bizarre calls, striking up conversations with   <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9872\" href=\"/vigo-the-carpathian/3005-9872/\" slug=\"vigo-the-carpathian\"> Vigo the Carpathian</a>, and generally just soaking in the rich  ectoplasmic atmosphere. Once the game kicks in, you'll go on a whirlwind tour of memorable Ghostbusters faces and places, starting off with the recapturing of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2646\" href=\"/slimer/3005-2646/\" slug=\"slimer\"> Slimer</a> at the Sedgwick Hotel, moving to Times Square to face the  <a data-ref-id=\"3005-951\" href=\"/stay-puft-marshmallow-man/3005-951/\" slug=\"stay-puft-marshmallow-man\"> Stay-Puft Marshmallow Man</a>, and then on to the main branch of the New York Public <a data-ref-id=\"3035-963\" href=\"/library/3035-963/\" slug=\"library\"> Library</a> to finally bring in the silence-loving Grey Lady. The story even does a fairly admirable job of tying it all back into a story about  Gozer the Gozerian. For the first few hours, I honestly found all the loving fan service intoxicating. Even the new characters and locations seemed to mesh well. \u00a0<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/470666-201388_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-470666\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"576\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3699/470666-201388_2_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-470666\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3699/470666-201388_2_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's like a Ghostbusters wax museum!</figcaption></figure>Eventually, though, I realized that, while there were moments of amusement, there hadn't been an honest laugh in the game. The references and call-backs are relentless, but just saying \"hey, remember that?\" isn't inherently funny. The tone of the material itself isn't great,\u00a0but part of the blame definitely rests on the voice work itself, which often feels flat and disconnected from the action. Still, you can tell that someone is really proud of the fact that they got <a data-ref-id=\"3040-36014\" href=\"/bill-murray/3040-36014/\" slug=\"bill-murray\"> Bill Murray</a>,   <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89702\" href=\"/dan-aykroyd/3040-89702/\" slug=\"dan-aykroyd\"> Dan Aykroyd</a>,   Harold Ramis,  Ernie Hudson, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-71886\" href=\"/annie-potts/3040-71886/\" slug=\"annie-potts\"> Annie Potts</a>, and  William Atherton to reprise their roles, because it seems like there's barely a moment that someone's not chatting your ear off. Characters are constantly explaining your next objective, providing some backstory, or shouting out helpful tips when you're going at it with ghosts. Again, it's rich in volume, but it can feel overbearing, and it has a habit of recycling certain lines a little too often. It bums me out to admit it, but after spending some six hours playing through the story in Ghostbusters: The Video Game, I don't want to hear any of those actors' voices for a while.<br/><br/> The process of trapping a ghost is an involved one, and in Ghostbusters: The Video Game, a terrific-looking one, as well. The way your energy beam chaotically twists around your targets and blows apart any unfortunate objects that might get in your path, and the way a ghost will stretch out and try to claw its way away from the trap look as good as it ever did in the movies. The characters look uncannily like 19-year-younger versions of the actors playing them, though there's something about the way they animate, particularly during cutscenes, that feels cartoony in a way that doesn't quite match the characters or the voice work.<br/><br/> The gameplay is reliant on the basic act of busting ghosts and the familiar hardware associated with it. There are a lot of lesser spooks that will evaporate if you hammer on them long enough, but you'll also spend a lot of time going through the full capture process, wearing down ghosts and wrangling them into a trap.\u00a0You start off with a basic neutrino wand and ghost trap setup, but as the story progresses, you'll be granted upgrades that allow you to shoot more concussive blasts of energy, \"freeze\" ghosts with a stasis beam, neutralize toxic black slime with your positively charged slime blower, and more. Some of your proton pack's abilities--specifically the capture beam and the slime tether--let you play with the game's physics, allowing you to engage in some occasional light puzzle work.\u00a0You'll earn money for every ghost you take out, which you can put towards various upgrades, but for as regularly as the game introduces new toys for you to play with, I didn't feel like the core of the gameplay really changed that much from the beginning to the end, and it all feels a little bit sloppy. I\u00a0won't deny that it's unique amongst third-person shooters, but even still, what was exciting the first few times eventually felt rote to me.\u00a0<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/831357-shiny_image6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-831357\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/775/831357-shiny_image6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-831357\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/775/831357-shiny_image6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/775/831357-shiny_image6.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's no question that trapping ghosts is a cool-looking process.</figcaption></figure>Most of the time, the game puts you on a narrow, straightforward path. Turns out this is a good thing, as it's rotten about giving you cues as to where you need to go next, which can lead to some aimless wandering on the rare occasion that it opens up a little bit. You'll spend most of the game rolling with some combination of the Ghostbusters team, who will occasionally lead you down the right path, back you up in a fight, and revive you if you get knocked down. Your AI-controlled teammates can get knocked down too, and it seems like that happens rather often, leading to a number of chaotic situations where it feels like you're spending more time babysitting the AI than actually bustin' ghosts.<br/><br/> Perhaps most baffling to me about my experience with Ghostbusters: The Video Game is, as problematic as I found the single-player experience, how much I found myself enjoying the multiplayer. This online mode consists of six different four-player co-op \"job\" types, which you can attack one at a time, or in a few different three-level mini-campaigns. It's mostly just variants on arena-based multiplayer modes you're probably already familiar with, but the unique tools of the Ghostbusters put an interesting twist on them, and there's some good persistence with the money you earn and a \"most wanted\" list of ghosts to hunt down to keep you coming back. Some modified weapon behavior aside, it doesn't really handle much differently from the single-player, but the pacing is tighter and playing with live teammates is far more gratifying. This, no doubt, is a point that will irritate PC players, as that version of Ghostbusters: The Video Game features none of the multiplayer action found in the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions.<br/><br/> Ghostbusters: The Video Game is nothing if not enthusiastic for the source material, which will undoubtedly be enough for some to have a good time. It certainly kept me going for a good while, but nostalgia alone couldn't quite carry the whole experience. This is one of the pitfalls of something as recognizable as Ghostbusters.

You can team up with your space rabbit friend to assume a few alternate animal forms with special powers, and there's the occasional special level that has you doing things like riding in a mine cart. But mostly, the game is about exploring simplistic levels to look for hidden items, spin your way through some benign enemies, and find the doorway to the next section of the level.</div><div><br/></div><div>You do get different controls depending on whether Starfy is underwater, where you can swim very quickly, or on dry land, where the game plays more like a traditional platformer. This helps give the gameplay a little more variety, but there were also times where I felt like I was switching between the two styles--which use some of the same buttons for different actions--too quickly to keep up with which button did what. The collision detection is also a little weird in spots, so overall the action doesn't feel as precise as you'd expect it to in a game like this.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/951307-medium_3429661185_728375825e_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-951307\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/495/951307-medium_3429661185_728375825e_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-951307\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/495/951307-medium_3429661185_728375825e_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/495/951307-medium_3429661185_728375825e_o.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Kids will probably love it.</figcaption></figure>There are a few other features around the game's periphery, but they don't really address the core action. You can collect a bunch of outfits and accessories to dress Starfy up in, but it would be nice if these actually applied to your in-game character rather than just a 3D model in your menu screen. There are a ton of secret levels to unlock outside the main story ones, where you can find more secrets, and you can invite a second player to control Starfy's female counterpart Starly for boss battles and at a few other predefined moments (though the bosses are generally easier to manage by yourself than with another player gumming up the works).</div><div><br/></div><div>The Legendary Starfy really seems targeted at a younger audience. With its cartoon-like visuals and light challenge level, kids will probably eat it right up--and it's surely a higher quality game than most of the child-oriented DS games on the market, coming as it does with the highly polished sheen characteristic of all Nintendo games. Maybe if Starfy had been around in the Western market for years and engendered the same sort of nostalgia that we older gamers feel for franchises like Mario, I'd be more forgiving of this game's simplistic nature--but as a newcomer to the series, I found myself wanting for a platformer with a little more meat on its bones.</div>", "deck": "This endearing DS platformer is sickeningly cute but a little too light on challenge and complexity.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-169/", "platforms": "Nintendo DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21016/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legendary-starfy/3030-21016/", "id": 21016, "name": "The Legendary Starfy"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-06-19 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82604/", "id": 82604, "name": "The Legendary Starfy"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/sam-max-save-the-world-review/1900-170/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/217/366580-sammax104_2008_07_28_17_14_38_95.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366580\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/217/366580-sammax104_2008_07_28_17_14_38_95.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366580\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/217/366580-sammax104_2008_07_28_17_14_38_95.png\"></a><figcaption>The Secret Service dance number is a real high point.</figcaption></figure>The six episodes of classic adventure gaming found in Sam &amp; Max Save the World make for some of the funniest moments in the past five years of gaming. Compiling them into one download and only charging $20 for them feels like some sort of clerical error... well, at least it does until you pick up the controller and start playing. Translating a point-and-click adventure game over to a gamepad makes everything feel just a touch slower, and after an hour or so of play, I found myself wishing that the phony \"warp drive\" option in the menus actually did something.</div><div><br/></div><div>But the pokey cursor movement that you get when translating a mouse cursor to a gamepad and the game's occasionally choppy frame rate are probably the only bad things you can say about this collection. The characters are charming and memorable, the dialogue is often hilarious, and the game is technically proficient enough to usually convey that dialogue with the appropriate comic timing. The episodic nature of the set lets Sam (the dog) and Max (the rabbit-like thing) get into plenty of wild situations. While each episode manages to be fairly self-contained, they play off of one-another enough to make the whole season feel like a cohesive story. As such, allow me to advise you to play through all six episodes in order, even though the main menu lets you take them on however you please.</div><div><br/></div><div>The gameplay itself is pretty standard as point-and-click adventure games go. You're primarily solving puzzles to move forward, and you interact with objects by, you know, clicking on them. Clicking on an open area lets you walk around the environments, and you also have an inventory of items that you use in conjunction with other items. So, for example, you might pick up a plate and set it on a cow's head. Or maybe you'll pull out your pistol and shoot objects, just for kicks. The puzzles you'll solve are generally pretty clever, and since moving past the puzzles gives you more opportunities for hilarious dialogue on topics including hypnosis, child stars, goofy songs, old video game hardware, the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1294\" href=\"/the-mafia/3015-1294/\" slug=\"the-mafia\">mafia</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3731\" href=\"/abraham-lincoln/3005-3731/\" slug=\"abraham-lincoln\">Abe Lincoln</a>, moving through the game is appropriately rewarding.</div><div><br/></div><div>Graphically, the game stays fairly cartoony, with just enough facial detail for the characters to give knowing glances to each other, or the camera. There's enough fidelity to the environments to make things you'll need to interact with plainly visible, though the frame rate can get pretty dicey in spots. The audio is fantastic, with great voice acting across the board and great music backing it all up.</div><div><br/></div><div>Funny games are still something of a rarity, so even though these episodes of Sam &amp; Max originated on the PC two years ago, they still totally stand up against more recent releases. Also, with six different episodes to move through, you'll probably end up spending something like eight to 12 hours playing through them all. When taken as one long game, the quality stays high throughout, making that $20 investment well worth the money.</div>", "deck": "Sam & Max Save the World is easily the funniest game on the Xbox 360.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-170/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-6049/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sam-max-save-the-world/3030-6049/", "id": 6049, "name": "Sam & Max Save the World"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-06-19 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84488/", "id": 84488, "name": "Sam & Max: Save The World"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fight-night-round-4-review/1900-171/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/970431-ali_actionpose_layered_curve_jen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-970431\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5634\" data-width=\"5000\" style=\"width: 5000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/970431-ali_actionpose_layered_curve_jen.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-970431\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/970431-ali_actionpose_layered_curve_jen.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Warning: Game features punching, hitting, and gloves.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-8095\" href=\"/fight-night-round-3/3030-8095/\" slug=\"fight-night-round-3\">Fight Night Round 3</a> proved to be a great early example of the graphical prowess of the current generation of consoles. The 2006 release had well-conceived control that let new players pick up the strategy of boxing, and on top of that it looked terrific. Round 4 picks up where that game left off, offering better graphics, a similar control scheme, and a lot of underlying differences that might not seem immediately apparent, but actually add meaningful depth to boxer selection and fighting styles.</div><div><br/></div><div>The big difference with Round 4 is that fighter heights and reach are now a factor. When you pick the taller guys with the longer reach, you'll do better if you can keep the fight at arm's length, hammering away with jabs and straights while the (hopefully) shorter fighter can't even effectively retaliate. But those shorter fighters can be way more explosive once they do manage to get inside, with hooks and uppercuts that are built to knock dudes down. At the same time, the taller, outside fighters don't excel at closer ranges. So in these fights where there's a meaningful difference in height, those stylistic differences sort of dictate the pace of the fight.</div><div><br/></div><div>A big part of the gameplay in Fight Night now focuses on counterpunching. Sure, your normal shots do damage when they land, and you can swirl the right stick around in different ways to throw all sorts of combinations, but you're going to need to figure out the defensive actions if you want to do well at higher difficulty levels or against skilled human opposition. You can block high or low and sway around in different directions to dodge punches. The catch is that you want to time those actions just right, blocking or dodging at the last second. When you do, you set yourself up to land a counterpunch, which is more effective than your standard punches. The game feels like it sort of slows down for a second when a counterpunch is possible, and when you land one, there's a bright flash as it hits. Considering that the timing windows for both setting up and landing a counterpunch can be sort of tight, slowing it down makes total sense from a gameplay perspective. But in a game that feels mostly focused on realism, the system feels a bit more \"gamey\" than you might expect.</div><div><br/></div><div>Outside the ring, Fight Night Round 4 starts to struggle a bit. Aside from \"fight now,\" which is the game's exhibition fight mode where you just set up matches and go, there's a career mode, called Legacy. The core idea is that you want to set up your created boxer's legacy and retire as the Greatest of All Time, and to do that you'll need to play through your fighter's career and complete certain tasks. The career mode is needlessly wrapped in layers and layers of unnecessary menus, like an e-mail inbox that literally never tells you anything of any value. Or a calendar that forces you to simulate the days leading up to your fight, even if nothing that matters to your fighter actually happens on those days. A simple screen that lets you select your next opponent and choose how many training sessions you want before your next fight (with the trade-off being that the more time you spend fighting, the closer you get to getting old and needing to retire) could have streamlined this process without losing anything meaningful along the way. In this mode you'll also have the option to play a few training minigames. If you choose to auto-train, you only get 50 percent of the maximum benefit you could get by acing the training session. I did so horribly at my first few sessions that I decided to auto-train for the rest of my career. That decision never came back to haunt me.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/948243-tyson_profile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-948243\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.64804469273743\" data-width=\"358\" style=\"width: 358px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/948243-tyson_profile.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-948243\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/948243-tyson_profile.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dodge right after he winks, then counterpunch!</figcaption></figure>Fight Night Round 4 has 48 licensed fighters in it, many of which come from the annals of boxing history. I mean, it's awesome that <a data-ref-id=\"3040-68700\" href=\"/muhammad-ali/3040-68700/\" slug=\"muhammad-ali\">Muhammad Ali</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-170\" href=\"/mike-tyson/3005-170/\" slug=\"mike-tyson\">Mike Tyson</a> are in the game and on the cover, but it's kind of a sad commentary on the state of boxing that these great, long-retired fighters are still the most recognizable faces in the sport. Even the commentary in the game makes a reference to how boxing used to be a major sport. But with the game's great create-a-boxer features, you can fill out the game's roster however you see fit.</div><div><br/></div><div>While you can go through the standard process of adjusting sliders to move brows and tilt noses, the game also supports photo imports, both from the cameras on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, as well as via EA's website, where you can simply upload much better, higher resolution photos. From there, the game seamlessly downloads the photos, you adjust a few markers to point out the features of the face you're importing, and it generates a head. While it can go wrong in several ridiculous ways, when it gets it right, the head importing feature is kind of scary. Beyond the faces, you can also place your created fighters into different weight classes, select from different fighting and blocking styles, tweak your height or your reach, and place points into multiple attributes, such as right arm strength or stamina.</div><div><br/></div><div>While you can certainly spend a lot of time fighting against the various levels of AI in the quick fight or career modes, this is a boxing game. It almost goes without saying that you'll enjoy it more if you're playing against another person. Naturally, the exhibition fight mode lets you square off locally. But the game also has an online component to it. It offers the standard ranked and unranked fights, but there's also a cool mode that revolves around the created fighters and has separate leaderboards, complete with a champion. This mode, called World Championship, levels the stats across the different created fighters and lets you duke it out, work your way up the rankings, and hopefully challenge for the belt.</div><div><br/></div><div>Presentation-wise, the game's got great graphics. The crowds in the larger arenas, specifically, look great. Faces deform in a slow-motion replay that shows off punches that make fighters fall down. And punches generally look like they're doing damage and glancing off of blocking fighters properly. The audio of the fights is great, and the commentary is solid, at least at first. The duo on commentary have plenty of great stories about the real-life fighters in the game, but those only come up outside of career mode. Created fighters don't have any such stories, so the guys run through some various anecdotes. You'll hear every single one of those after 10 or 20 fights in career mode, which makes the commentary kind of annoying. Also, it's worth noting that you can import your own music and use it for menus and boxer entrances on the Xbox 360, but you'll have to disable the existing music entirely to use any external music, which seems a little weird. If you want to just import one track for your fighter, it seems like you're totally out of luck.</div><div><br/></div><div>Some of the things surrounding the boxing in Fight Night Round 4 are kind of annoying, especially if you're planning on primarily playing the game by yourself. But the fighting itself is fantastic and the online feels sharp enough to substitute for local opposition. Provided you haven't completely shifted any love you might have for boxing over to mixed martial arts already, you'll probably love it.</div>", "deck": "Between its legendary roster and authentic gameplay, Fight Night Round 4 is a great homage to the sport of boxing.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-171/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20452/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fight-night-round-4/3030-20452/", "id": 20452, "name": "Fight Night Round 4"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-06-23 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82612/", "id": 82612, "name": "Fight Night Round 4"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/guitar-hero-smash-hits-review/1900-172/", "description": "<div><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/958836-958079_20090420_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958836\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/958836-958079_20090420_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958836\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/958836-958079_20090420_screen004.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Oh, and it looks like Guitar Hero, in case you were wondering.</figcaption></figure>Guitar Hero: Smash Hits is a nearly fully featured <a data-ref-id=\"3025-289\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\" slug=\"guitar-hero\">Guitar Hero</a> game based on the foundation laid by the last full game in the series, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20673\" href=\"/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-world-tour\">World Tour</a>. It offers a song list full of tracks that have appeared in previous Guitar Hero games, but don't get your anti-rehash pitchforks out just yet. Since this is based on Guitar Hero: World Tour, you can now play as a full four-person band with vocals, drums, guitar, and bass. So it doesn't feel like warmed-over leftovers from the series' past. That said, something about the game's full $59.99 price tag doesn't quite feel right, either.</div><div><br/></div><div>Maybe that's because these songs all appeared in games that were chosen for their guitar parts. It's no surprise that a game called <i>Guitar</i> Hero would have songs with great guitar parts... but that doesn't mean I want to try to sing or play drums on \"Through The Fire And Flames\" by DragonForce, either. Also, the game's guitar parts have been retracked with new note patterns. If you're a Guitar Hero purist with fond memories of which buttons you needed to press back in the good old days, this might bother you. But considering how much the difficulty in Guitar Hero games has ramped up since those early days, retracking the songs to place them more in line with the modern releases allows the songs to still be a challenge on the higher difficulties.</div><div><br/></div><div>While the game has support for the goofy GHTunes feature, where you can create tracks using various instrument samples and freely share them online, it doesn't have support for the proper, paid downloadable content that you may or may not have been buying for World Tour. This seems kind of silly. Also, while the Guitar Hero series hasn't been big on exporting tracks from a disc for use with another Guitar Hero game, you should probably know that you can't export the Smash Hits soundtrack and just play it in World Tour. This would have been a nice feature, since Smash Hits is little more than a collection of new songs to play with your existing hardware.</div><div><br/></div><div><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/918044-ghgh030509007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-918044\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/918044-ghgh030509007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-918044\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/918044-ghgh030509007.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yup, still Guitar Hero down here, too.</figcaption></figure>Beyond that, this has the same features you'd expect to find in a Guitar Hero game. There's a career mode that provides a progression through the songs when playing alone or as a group, or you can just go to quick play, where everything's already unlocked. There are also a bunch of online modes that let you compete against or cooperate with players on the other side of the Internet.</div><div><br/></div><div>Even though some of the songs appeared as covers in the previous games, they're all being done by the original artists now. In some cases (probably cases where the original masters weren't available), the game doesn't have the original recording. For example, Pantera's \"Cowboys From Hell\" is a live track. So, provided you're pleased with the feature set, it really comes down to a desire to play the songs on the disc. Probably the best advice I can give you is to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25521\" href=\"/guitar-hero-smash-hits/3030-25521/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-smash-hits\">take a look at that song list</a>, weigh it against your desire to play them across multiple instruments, and go from there.

Considering first-person shooters seem to be getting released at the rate of one or two a month, you'd think there wouldn't be room for a game that doesn't come close to meeting the standards of the genre. But The Conduit carves out a decent niche by being one of the few games that take place from this perspective and were developed solely for the Wii. As a Wii-only release, The Conduit is kind of neat and certainly unique. But it's more interesting for the way it uses a Wii Remote and Nunchuk than it is as an actual game.<br/><br/> The game's story is your typical alien-filled and shadowy government conspiracy that doesn't really go anywhere. All you really need to know is that the bug-like alien troops come out of glowing portals called conduits. So a lot of the gameplay tasks you with fighting your way up to a conduit, and then shutting it with a grenade. You'll also have to pull out the  all-seeing eye, a glowing orb that acts as your primary way to interact with computers and as a beam that reveals hidden objects in the world. Sometimes you'll use this to unlock doors that block your forward progress. Other times, you'll use it to open up secret pathways to additional weaponry, disarm normally invisible mines, and so on.<br/><br/> You can hold two weapons at once, and you'll encounter weapons from different factions, including secret high-tech energy weapons, alien rifles, and regular human technology. You'll also grab a lot of grenades... seriously, sometimes it seems like every single enemy has a grenade on their corpse. You toss grenades by shaking the Nunchuk, which isn't always as responsive as you'd want.<br/><br/> Playing The Conduit requires a Wii Remote and a Nunchuk. The control is pretty intuitive, but it takes time to get used to aiming and turning by pointing at the screen. I probably fumbled around with the aiming control for around half an hour before I started getting comfortable. The game offers a lot of different sliders and options for tweaking the control, but I ended up leaving it alone in the end. The more I changed things, the worse the control felt. But even once you get the hang of the controls, it all feels a little delicate. The lock-on targeting jerks your view around, which can be disorienting. The turning radius never feels quite right and makes the game seem sluggish. In fact, all of the movement feels deliberately slower than the average shooter. But the game seems like it was built with that in mind, as it's a fairly low-impact experience overall. The instances where it gets more hectic quickly became my least favorite parts of the game, since that's when the game's control wasn't up to the task at hand.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/955216-screenshot_164.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-955216\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/955216-screenshot_164.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-955216\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/955216-screenshot_164.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can open fire on live targets in the online multiplayer mode.</figcaption></figure>Overall, the campaign is short and uneventful, with plenty of repetitive moments and enough atrocious voice acting to make you almost glad that it's not particularly long. It's backed up by some decent multiplayer that comes in deathmatch, team deathmatch, and a capture the flag variant where players attempt to capture the ASE. While the control sort of got in my way here from time to time, there's really nothing else quite like it on the Wii. Heck, it even has support for the WiiSpeak peripheral, which hasn't seen any use since it was released alongside Animal Crossing: City Folk. Unfortunately, you'll have to exchange friend codes with other people who own a WiiSpeak if you actually want to use it, as it's disabled in games with random opponents. But if you've been following the way Nintendo rolls with its online feature set, that probably won't come as much of a surprise.<br/><br/> It has a generic look to it, but The Conduit doesn't look bad. The environments can get sort of large, and the areas are detailed well enough. You'll probably notice that those environments aren't destructible, and the enemy design is kind of lame. It also maintains a good, smooth frame rate throughout.<br/><br/> If you're just comparing it to other action games released on the Wii, The Conduit does some interesting things with its control and with its multiplayer modes. But other aspects, like the poor story, bland design, and awful voice acting, would be just as bad on any platform.

The game does a good job of implementing a transforming mechanic that blends shooting and melee combat with vehicular action, and it also has a decent grasp of what makes a good third-person action game in general. It's fun enough to use your big robot to blow up other big robots in short bursts, but a lack of variety in the mission design makes it run out of steam before you can blast through all of its available action.<br/><br/> Revenge has separate Autobot and Decepticon campaigns that relate to the movie's storyline. But the missions and locations in both campaigns range from similar to identical, so the only reason to play through both of them is to play as all of the available Transformers. Each of them has different sorts of weapons and, of course, turns into a different sort of vehicle. You can use the transforming ability to pull off a handful of neat tricks, like speeding down the road as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1883\" href=\"/bumblebee/3005-1883/\" slug=\"bumblebee\"> Bumblebee</a> in Camaro form, hitting your turbo boost, changing to robot mode and leaping straight into the air, then grabbing onto and climbing up the face of a building like you're King Kong. The controls are generally responsive in both vehicle and robot forms, and the melee and shooting are competent and satisfying enough as well, if a little repetitive.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1069301-transformers_movie.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1069301\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"320\" style=\"width: 320px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1069301-transformers_movie.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1069301\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1069301-transformers_movie.png\"></a><figcaption>...one shall--wait, wrong movie.</figcaption></figure>All the characters you'd expect from the Bay movies are in here, from\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3005-151\" href=\"/optimus-prime/3005-151/\" slug=\"optimus-prime\"> Optimus Prime</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6378\" href=\"/ironhide/3005-6378/\" slug=\"ironhide\"> Ironhide</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1786\" href=\"/starscream/3005-1786/\" slug=\"starscream\"> Starscream</a>\u00a0and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2175\" href=\"/megatron/3005-2175/\" slug=\"megatron\"> Megatron</a>\u00a0(and, of course, the ones you've never heard of). You'll get to do some flying as helicopters and planes from time to time, but most of the Transformers turn into ground-based vehicles, and all of them handle about the same. Each of the robots on a given side have different weapons and special abilities, but those are mostly mirrored by a character from the other faction, so again, the gameplay starts to feel stale when you finish one side's storyline and then crack into the other (though at least you can play them both concurrently if you want).<br/><br/> You get a marginally interesting progression mechanic by earning experience during missions that you can cash in back at HQ for upgrades like faster weapon cooldown times, more health, and a bigger turbo meter. There are also one-off challenges to complete, like getting a certain number of headshots with a given character, and these unlock some goodies like concept art and several entire episodes of the original <i>Transformers</i> cartoon series. It's faint praise for Revenge of the Fallen itself that my most exciting moment with it was watching \"S.O.S. Dinobots\" for the first time in two decades--but then, it's tough to beat the Dinobots.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/958039-1239745030.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958039\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.52162162162162\" data-width=\"740\" style=\"width: 740px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17537/958039-1239745030.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958039\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17537/958039-1239745030.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17537/958039-1239745030.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Going from robot to vehicle is actually pretty fun.</figcaption></figure>The action is solid enough, but there just isn't much to do from mission to mission. The objectives rarely get more complex than \"kill all the enemies coming at you until the mission is over,\" and when they do, they merely add a simple escort or protection layer to the basic combat. The levels feel a little bit like an open world, but in reality they're just rectangular maps that sort of let you go anywhere, until you hit their artificial boundaries. As it stands, the game is entertaining enough that it's fun to blow away nameless fodder robots for two or three missions per session, but Revenge of the Fallen really could have used a more elaborate world, more intricate mission designs, or <i>something</i> with more substance to wrap its basic combat mechanics around.<br/><br/> That combat at least translates reasonably well into online multiplayer with a handful of modes. They're all stock competitive game types--capture the shard (er, flag), a VIP mode, a control point mode, and team deathmatch--but at least there's a decent number of them. The multiplayer isn't anywhere near as serious as what you get in your <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20777\" href=\"/call-of-duty-world-at-war/3030-20777/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-world-at-war\"> Call of Duty</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\" href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" slug=\"halo-3\"> Halo</a>, but there's enough entertainment value there that if the idea of taking Prime online against Megatron sounds like fun to you, it's worth doing a few times.<br/><br/> Actually, that pretty well describes the ideal audience for Revenge of the Fallen in general. If you're just a regular Joe looking for a great action game, you could do better.

Though the series had its ups and downs, when the Monkey Island games were at their best, they were one of the high watermarks for how funny and clever a game could be. It's been a while since we've seen the continued adventures of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-657\" href=\"/guybrush-threepwood/3005-657/\" slug=\"guybrush-threepwood\">       Guybrush Threepwood</a>, and now <a data-ref-id=\"3010-397\" href=\"/telltale-games/3010-397/\" slug=\"telltale-games\">      Telltale</a> is at the helm with Tales of Monkey Island, a brand-new five-episode adventure, the first episode of which is available now. Considering the actual quality of the previous Monkey Island games, as well as the legend that people have built up in their minds during their eight-year absence, expectations are high. Luckily, Telltale is staffed to the gills with folks who were key players in past Monkey Island games, and they don't seem to have lost their touch with Tales.<br/><br/>Launch of the Screaming Narwhal initially catches our hero Guybrush Threepwood in the middle of another jam involving his wife and former governor of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-177\" href=\"/melee-island/3035-177/\" slug=\"melee-island\">     M\u00eal\u00e9e Island</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-756\" href=\"/elaine-marley/3005-756/\" slug=\"elaine-marley\">    Elaine Marley-Threepwood</a>, and the voodoo-ghost-zombie-demon-pirate <a data-ref-id=\"3005-762\" href=\"/lechuck/3005-762/\" slug=\"lechuck\">   LeChuck</a>. After an ill-considered root beer incantation, Elaine is left in the clutches of a re-mortalized LeChuck, and Guybrush is marooned with a LeChuck-possessed hand on Flotsam Island, which is where this episode takes place. The title refers to the only ship on Flotsam Island, which Guybrush must wrest from a local pirate, though he also has to contend with a mysterious weather system that keeps the inhabitants of Flotsam Island trapped there as well.<br/><br/>This episode seems very deliberately designed to ease you back into the world of Monkey Island, and the events on Flotsam Island feel like a warm-up for the proper adventure. Elaine and LeChuck don't figure in too heavily just yet, allowing you to get familiar with the unique way in which Guybrush buckles swash, as well as the series' goofy, anachronistic, easy-going approach to the topics of piracy and island voodoo. There's still plenty of room for callbacks and references tailored for established Monkey Islanders, though it's rarely so inside that first-timers won't be able to find the humor in silly pirates and sillier names for pirate stuff.<br/><br/>There's a good amount of funny, well-delivered dialog here, and the story is propelled by puzzles that tend to focus on combining and using inventory items in unconventional ways, as well as the deciphering of treasure maps. As far as the complexity and obscurity of the puzzles, I only found myself stumped by Launch of the Screaming Narwhal once, and the solution ended up being far simpler than I had assumed. There's a subtle hint system to occasionally nudge you in the right direction, something you can adjust the prominence of or turn off entirely.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/1042126-talesofmi_flotsam.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042126\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56333333333333\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4938/1042126-talesofmi_flotsam.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042126\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4938/1042126-talesofmi_flotsam.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Strange things are afoot on Flotsam Island.</figcaption></figure>  My only substantial gripe about Tales of Monkey Island so far is the way the hybrid controls handle. Rather than opt for pure point-and-click, you've got direct control over Guybrush using either the keyboard or the mouse, though you still have to use the mouse to interact with people and objects. Fixed camera angles and a certain lack of fidelity in the controls just make both control options feel like a little bit of a struggle. There's also some awkwardness to the way you open up your inventory and use items from it. It has no significant ill impact on the actual puzzles, but it's kind of clunky.<br/><br/>If this first episode is any indication, Tales of Monkey Island is shaping up to be Telltale's most visually ambitious game yet. Everything is nicely stylized with a palette that recalls the old Monkey Island games, and with few minor exceptions, the animation is all very lively. Though there's a nice little depth of field effect, this isn't going to win any technical awards. Still, there's just a jauntiness to the whole look of the game that compliments the humor really well.<br/><br/>I was really satisfied with the three or four hours it took me to get through Launch of the Narwhal, and the episode ends on a delicious cliffhanger that has me eager to see what happens in next month's episode.", "deck": "Telltale delivers a breezy pirate adventure with its first episode, easing into the fiction while still honoring the Monkey Island name.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-175/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26776/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-launch-of-the-scr/3030-26776/", "id": 26776, "name": "Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 1: Launch of the Screaming Narwhal"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-07-07 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84491/", "id": 84491, "name": "Tales of Monkey Island Chapter 1: Launch of the Screaming Narwhal"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/trine-review/1900-176/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31992/1073646-shot_2009_07_06__2_50_26_a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073646\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.8\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:80.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31992/1073646-shot_2009_07_06__2_50_26_a.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1073646\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31992/1073646-shot_2009_07_06__2_50_26_a.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The thief's grappling hook lets you go places, fast.</figcaption></figure>Every time you think about turning your back on the 2D action genre, a game like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24739\" href=\"/trine/3030-24739/\" slug=\"trine\"> Trine</a> comes along to remind you why this style of game still matters, and can still surprise you. The satisfaction of playing Trine hinges on a thorough physics model that touches every aspect of the mechanics, from the platforming and puzzle-solving to the combat, both melee and ranged. Every level contains enough inventive and challenging puzzles and platforming obstacles--swaddled in beautiful, lovingly detailed graphics--to propel you straight through to the end of the game, and likely leave you wishing there were even more levels to play through.<br/><br/> Trine has a boilerplate but somehow still endearing fantasy storyline about a wizard, a warrior, and a thief who, through an unfortunate coincidence involving a mysterious artifact, become fused into one person. Their loss is your gain. Thanks to this magical predicament, you can switch between the three characters instantly at the touch of a button. (It's quite a bit like that old pre-<a data-ref-id=\"3025-4\" href=\"/warcraft/3025-4/\" slug=\"warcraft\"> Warcraft</a> classic from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1088\" href=\"/blizzard-entertainment/3010-1088/\" slug=\"blizzard-entertainment\"> Blizzard</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5429\" href=\"/the-lost-vikings/3030-5429/\" slug=\"the-lost-vikings\"> The Lost Vikings</a>.) Since all three have dramatically different abilities, this feature is absolutely central to Trine's gameplay, which encourages you to switch around and experiment with different approaches to a given problem. There are plenty of places where you'll need to set up a solution with one character, then switch to another character on the fly--maybe even in mid-jump--to see it through.<br/><br/> The thief is the most mobile of the three, with a grappling hook that lets you pull off some snazzy momentum-based aerial flips and tricks when you get a feel for the way she swings. The wizard has no direct combat abilities, but he's your bridge-layer and general obstacle-goer-arounder, since he can summon stackable boxes, levitating platforms, and short bridges. And of course the warrior acts as the brawn, with a sword and shield that you'll use to vanquish the scores of skeletons that have overrun your kingdom, as you search for a way to split the three adventurers back up.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042976-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ht.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042976\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042976-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ht.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042976\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042976-trine_screenshot_2009_06_ht.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The combat controls give you a lot of flexibility.</figcaption></figure>Trine is primarily a methodically paced puzzle game, so it's high praise to say the game's combat is also a lot of fun. The thief is armed with a bow and arrow, and you can vary the tension on the bowstring when you shoot it, letting you pull fancy moves like arcing arrows over obstacles and through narrow openings when you get a feel for it. The warrior has a shield he can hold up to protect himself from any angle, and he can also pick up and throw large objects. What really makes the combat work is the aiming system, which lets you aim the thief's bow and the warrior's shield and thrown objects in an arc around the character with a great degree of precision, using either the mouse or a gamepad's right analog stick. This frees you up to do things like raising your shield over the warrior's head to protect yourself from a rain of debris, or raining a shower of arrows down over a high wall with a carefully aimed bow shot.<br/><br/> Trine would still be great if you were limited to the characters' basic set of abilities, but there's a thin layer of RPG-style character progression on top of the core action that lets you customize the gameplay to a small extent. Mainly, there's a level-up system that lets you upgrade each character's three core abilities with a sort of basic talent tree setup. You only gain experience points from certain enemies; most of it is embodied in little green bottles that are scattered in the hardest-to-reach places in each level, so there's a direct tangible benefit to your characters that results from exploring every nook and cranny. By the same token, you can find loot in treasure chests hidden around each level that buffs a given character's stats and gives them some bonus survival options. You can trade your gear around between characters to get the most benefit, and by the latter half of the game your characters will start to become way more powerful than they were at the beginning.<br/><br/> There's not much I can say about Trine's visuals that you can't see for yourself in videos, but this is seriously a fantastic-looking game. The artists use the fixed camera angle to great effect here, giving the levels a real feeling of depth with expansive backgrounds and extremely close-up foreground objects that make you forget you're only operating in a 2D space. There's also an expert use of color palette, set pieces, and environmental effects in every level that combine to establish a great sense of cohesive atmosphere. The lavish graphics don't come at a great hardware expense, either; even my modestly equipped PC kept the game locked at a fully playable 60 frames per second at high settings.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/832413-trine01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-832413\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56257744733581\" data-width=\"807\" style=\"width: 807px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7439/832413-trine01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-832413\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/832413-trine01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7439/832413-trine01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Nobody will call this an ugly game.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>You can also play Trine with a local drop-in cooperative mode that lets two or three people control all the characters at once. Three players makes the action a little too busy and demanding, and removes the ability to swap between characters entirely, which makes some of the obstacles a pain to get by. Two-player co-op feels like the sweet spot, since either player can still swap to the third character at any time to maintain that puzzle-solving flexibility that makes the single-player so much fun. And two characters can pull off some tricks you can't do in single-player, like the wizard giving the thief a levitated ride across a bottomless pit on a conjured platform. Still, I had the most fun playing solo, when I had complete control over all the characters' abilities and could use them in concert to do things in really creative ways.<br/><br/> It's worth noting that Trine is currently only available on the PC at a $30 price, while a PlayStation Network version is slated for release in the near future for only $20. Since I'd recommend playing the game with a gamepad over the mouse and keyboard anyway, I'd advise those with a PS3 to wait a bit and see how this less expensive option turns out. (An Xbox Live Arcade version is also on the way from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6490\" href=\"/atlus-usa-inc/3010-6490/\" slug=\"atlus-usa-inc\"> Atlus</a>, but that release is said to be several months away.)

While there are certainly some fascinating and sophisticated machinations in place, The Sims has always been more <a data-ref-id=\"3015-453\" href=\"/sandbox/3015-453/\" slug=\"sandbox\">   sandbox</a> than game in a traditional sense. The crazy popularity that the series has consistently experienced over the years also begs the question: Just who is a review of one of these games meant for? So, before we get any further here, let me just say this. If you liked <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2473\" href=\"/the-sims-2/3030-2473/\" slug=\"the-sims-2\">  The Sims 2</a>, you're probably already playing The Sims 3, and loving it, because it's basically that game, but with better technology and deeper options throughout. They haven't--as is always the fear with sequels to popular games--broken The Sims. But, if The Sims has never done anything for you, or its particular brand of suburban bliss has kept you at bay, this might be the one to change your mind.<br/><br/>Because there are so many different ways to play The Sims, I feel like it's worth shedding some light on how I've tended to approach the series, which I suspect is somewhat atypical and maybe a little sociopathic. Generally speaking, I've always treated The Sims as more of a game than it's probably intended. I'll focus my efforts on a single sim, with the self-imposed goal of maxing out my sim's skill meters, career path, and relationship status. Interior design and playing dress-up are of little concern to me, unless it's for stuff that has a significant impact on my sim's personal growth. For this reason, I rarely expand on the modest house you start out with, unless it's to fit more functional stuff in there. I treat social interactions strictly as opportunities to get all the other sims in the neighborhood to be hopelessly infatuated with my sim. Like I said, a little sociopathic, and maybe more of a glimpse into my own psyche than I'd care to admit. <br/><br/> There's nothing about The Sims 3 that would stop me from playing this way, and it doesn't appear to have done anything to disrupt any other play styles you might've become accustomed to. You can still treat your sims as little automatons that you micromanage and force to behave in whatever weird, transgressive fashion you see fit. But what's most interesting to me is that, in addition to a myriad of sliders to determine what your sim looks like, part of The Sims 3 character creation process now involves giving them some personality traits of their own. There are dozens to choose from, both good and bad, as well as the gloriously broad field of grey in between. You can make your sim the apex of perfection if you so desire--an athletic, charismatic achiever who's a great kisser and handy around the house--or you can go with a barely-functional social pariah who mooches off friends, hates the outdoors, and breaks down at the first sign of adversity. Personally, I found somewhere in the middle to be the most interesting. <br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6247/1056455-sims3_20090613_171853.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1056455\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6247/1056455-sims3_20090613_171853.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1056455\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6247/1056455-sims3_20090613_171853.png\"></a><figcaption>There are still few things more meta than watching your sim use a computer.  </figcaption></figure> Many of these personality traits won't have a huge impact on the overall play experience, but they add a great deal of texture to the sims themselves. The neurotic personality trait is my personal favorite for this very reason. A neurotic sim is still perfectly functional, save for the occasional compulsion to check the pilot light, wash his or her hands repeatedly, and indulge in a brief freak-out to calm the nerves. It's funny, and there's a kernel of truth to its impact on your sim's life. There's an option to adjust the amount of autonomy your sims have, but I found it most interesting to crank it all the way up and see how my funny, neurotic couch potato behaved. <br/><br/>The unique combination of personality traits you choose will go on to inform both your sim's everyday and lifetime wishes. Everyday wishes will pop up on the game's menu bar as you play, and can include improving your relationship with another sim, getting a promotion at work, spending some time watching TV, or ordering a pizza. Lifetime wishes are more significant, usually concerning maxing out certain skills or professions. Fulfilling both the everyday and the lifetime wishes earn you points that you can then sink into various perks for your sim, ranging from free lunches for life at restaurants to a teleportation pad that lets you travel anywhere instantly. I feel like the wishes help provide some focus to the gameplay in The Sims 3, even if the implementation is a little contrived at times. You can only have four active everyday wishes at a time, which makes a certain amount of sense, though my hunger for points lead me to choose the wishes that were easier to fulfill rather than the ones that were potentially more interesting. Again, this might speak more about me as a player than The Sims 3 as a game.<br/><br/>There's better technology under the hood in The Sims 3, which makes it an incrementally better-looking game than The Sims 2, though it also allows for a more seamless world. The insides of most non-residential buildings are still a mystery, which only really seems like a significant missed opportunity when it comes to your workplace. You'll need a nine-to-five to keep the fridge full and the bills paid, and as with past entries, the specifics of your workday are still a bit of a sausage factory, though you can choose, on a day-to-day basis, whether to bust your ass, suck up to the boss, socialize with coworkers, or just take her easy, which can impact both your sim's mood at the end of the day, as well as your sim's job performance.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6247/1050643-sims3_20090608_021300.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1050643\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6247/1050643-sims3_20090608_021300.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1050643\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6247/1050643-sims3_20090608_021300.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6247/1050643-sims3_20090608_021300.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some familiar faces, courtesy of The Sims 3 exchange. </figcaption></figure>  Many of the other changes and additions that The Sims 3 makes are just logical extensions of what the previous games offered. One of the key new features for the interior design- and fashion-obsessed players is the \"create a style\" system, which you can use to cultivate a set of patterns and materials that you're fond of and easily apply it to the objects in your home and the clothes on your sim's back. EA launched an online store and an online exchange with The Sims 2, and these are better integrated and much more prominent in The Sims 3. The exchange lets you share sims you've made and items you've customized with other players, and the store lets you buy, well, pretty much anything. The store makes it harder to ignore the whole microtransaction process that EA has become awfully fond of, though the precedent for expansion and content packs for The Sims is already well-established, and there's something to be said for being able to buy a new outfit or some new furniture  <i>a la carte</i>. The online experience in The Sims 3 also includes a video editor, which lets you cook up some machinima without any additional tools, if that's your bag.<br/><br/>A lot has changed in The Sims 3, but for all the technical refinements, gameplay additions, and online integration, it still scratches the same basic itch that its predecessors did, though it arguably does it with an improved effectiveness.

But every now and then, a game or two pops up. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25066\" href=\"/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/3030-25066/\" slug=\"call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood\"> Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood</a> counts as the \"or two\" in this case, being the second game in a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1238\" href=\"/call-of-juarez/3025-1238/\" slug=\"call-of-juarez\"> series</a> that launched back in 2007. This prequel makes for a serviceable first-person shooter, but it's the story of two brothers torn apart over money, women, and war that makes it a more worthwhile experience.<br/> <br/> The game opens with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11509\" href=\"/thomas-mccall/3005-11509/\" slug=\"thomas-mccall\"> Thomas</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3515\" href=\"/ray-mccall/3005-3515/\" slug=\"ray-mccall\"> Ray McCall</a> at each others' throats over a woman, then backs up to show you how it all came to a head. The game flashes back to the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1412\" href=\"/civil-war/3015-1412/\" slug=\"civil-war\"> War Between the States</a>. The McCalls are Georgians, fighting on the side of the Confederacy. When they decide to desert and attempt to save their family farm (and mother) from the advancing Yankees, it sets off a series of events that'll take most players around six hours to complete on the default difficulty setting. Since they deserted, the McCalls are no longer welcome back home, and are forced to break West to escape their old, still-sore commanding officer. They, along with younger brother William--a preacher who just sort of shakes his head as his older brothers go further and further to the dark side--eventually make their way to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-249\" href=\"/mexico/3035-249/\" slug=\"mexico\"> Mexico</a> in hopes of finding a lost Aztec treasure. There are plenty of double-crosses and twists to keep things reasonably interesting, though the game drags out its conclusion.<br/> <br/> Having the two brothers means that in most cases, you'll be able to choose which brother to control. Elder brother Ray is the strong one, so he can kick down some doors and barriers. He can also use dynamite to blow open pathways that Thomas is unable to take. For his part, Thomas is faster and uses a lasso in some situations to climb to higher ground. He also has throwing knives and can equip a bow, making him a stealth character in a game that doesn't really have very many stealth situations. Still, I think I enjoyed controlling Thomas more than Ray, as Thomas never seemed quite as sleazy as his older brother, and the bow that only Thomas can use is almost overpowered.<br/> <br/> With the exception of two open-area sections that let you take on a handful of side missions, Bound in Blood is a straightforward shooter that leads you along a mostly linear path from one objective to the next. Your enemies are mostly outlaws, soldiers, and Indians from various tribes. While I went through the majority of the game with a rifle, you can also wield pistols, shotguns, and so on. The guns come in differing qualities, so a \"prime\" or \"superb\" version of a gun is going to have better stats than a \"rusty\" version of the same weapon. There are spots set up throughout the game where you can spend cash--usually earned by completing side missions or picked up from dead bodies--on better weapons. Except in cases where you're dual-wielding pistols, the game subscribes to the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\"> Call of Duty</a> school of aiming control, with a button (the left trigger, on 360) devoted to a slight zoom that will snap to nearby targets.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/900681-sas.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-900681\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56166666666667\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/900681-sas.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-900681\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/900681-sas.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Ray and Thomas don't trust anyone... not even each other.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>It's a good thing that the story of Bound in Blood keeps things moving, because the game's largest problem is that the action is sort of bland. It breaks up its standard moving-and-shooting with a few horseback sequences that aren't very different from the regular action, and a handful of moments where you'll get on mounted <a data-ref-id=\"3055-288\" href=\"/gatling-gun/3055-288/\" slug=\"gatling-gun\"> Gatling guns</a>\u00a0to mow down a mess of enemies. The coolest moments are quickdraw duels, which is what the game sort of uses for boss fights. You'll have to outdraw most of your main enemies, which makes for some neat sequences, but it remains so similar from fight to fight that it, too, gets a little old before the game is finished. Also, it's disappointing that the game doesn't have cooperative play. Considering you're almost always running around with your brother by your side, it would have fit in just fine.<br/> <br/> The game does have a full-on multiplayer mode, though, allowing up to 12 players to compete in a variety of standard modes, including takes on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\"> team deathmatch</a> and assault. The multiplayer is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-305\" href=\"/class-based-shooter/3015-305/\" slug=\"class-based-shooter\"> class-based</a>, which lets you choose characters with different ratings in health and speed, as well as different weapons. You earn money as you play online, and some money can be used to upgrade your classes while in-game. These upgrades aren't persistent, though, so they'll only help you out in your current match. You also leave matches with an amount of money that can be spent to unlock additional classes. The multiplayer isn't bad, but unless you're absolutely bent on playing a shooter with a western theme, it probably won't replace your current multiplayer shooter of choice.<br/> <br/> All told, Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood makes for a good diversion. It doesn't last too long, tells a decent story, and offers enough multiplayer to give you something to mess around with when the single-player's done. It certainly isn't the most ambitious game in the world, but if you're looking for a competent western shooter, Juarez fits the bill just fine.", "deck": "While it lacks the \"Bible-as-a-weapon\" innovation found in the previous game, this prequel tale merges adequate gameplay with a plot good enough to keep you focused.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-178/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25066/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-juarez-bound-in-blood/3030-25066/", "id": 25066, "name": "Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-07-13 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82411/", "id": 82411, "name": "Call of Juarez: Bound in Blood"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/battlefield-1943-review/1900-179/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1017989-bf_1943_may_09_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1017989\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1017989-bf_1943_may_09_5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1017989\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1017989-bf_1943_may_09_5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Scenes like this happen all the time.</figcaption></figure>Considering how big, loud, and prolific <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4880\" href=\"/dice/3010-4880/\" slug=\"dice\">  DICE</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3025-51\" href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" slug=\"battlefield\">  Battlefield</a> series has gotten, it's probably a wonder we received any sort of sequel at all to the series' fondly but distantly remembered breakout hit <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12716\" href=\"/battlefield-1942/3030-12716/\" slug=\"battlefield-1942\">  Battlefield 1942</a>. The good news is that despite shipping with only three condensed player classes and a relatively small handful of maps, the downloadable, incrementally titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25262\" href=\"/battlefield-1943/3030-25262/\" slug=\"battlefield-1943\">  Battlefield 1943</a> nails all the series' requirements for dynamic, unpredictable, exciting multiplayer combat. Some unfortunate connection problems marred the first few days of release, especially on the Xbox 360, but now that things are mostly smoothed out, 1943 represents a great multiplayer value.<br/><br/> '43 focuses exclusively on the Pacific Theater of World War II with three greatest-hits maps from the original game: Wake Island, Guadalcanal, and Iwo Jima. All three are island maps with a symmetrical layout, since both the American and Japanese forces start from aircraft carriers on opposite sides of the map and vie for control of capture points that are laid out in a balanced fashion. Each map has subtleties and distinctive terrain that give it character, but they all play with a certain degree of similarity. You aren't going to see the massive tank battles you got on 1942's Battle of the Bulge, for instance--though a DLC map pack or two featuring some of that game's best European maps would be a welcome addition.<br/><br/> The maps' singular focus is consistent with the design philosophy of 1943 as a whole; it strips out the nonessential elements from the original game without losing the core feel and flow of the battles. Yes, the matches are limited to 12 players against 12, but the maps are tailored to the team size. Yes, there are only three classes, but the important abilities have all been spread across those three. You can't go prone, there are no ammo limits, the bombers are gone. You could assemble a big list of things that have changed if you're some kind of crazy purist for the old days. But the truth is, those things don't matter; you're still getting in tanks and blowing away enemy jeeps as they race by, or shooting down a fighter from an AA turret and ducking as its fiery fuselage hurtles straight past your head. It's still Battlefield and still a heck of a lot of fun.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>Thanks in large part to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20655\" href=\"/battlefield-bad-company/3030-20655/\" slug=\"battlefield-bad-company\">  Bad Company</a>'s Frostbite engine, DICE did a good job of keeping 1943 up to date with current standards, giving it a couple of new features, and making it work well on consoles. Destructible walls make it harder for enemies to camp out inside the buildings around each control point. It's also a lot of fun to drive a tank straight through fences and thickets of trees rather than getting stuck on them. The new air raid feature lets you send a trio of heavy bombers over the enemy base and carpet it with destruction via an underside camera angle. And the squad features--voice chat, spawning directly into your friends' vehicles, group scoring--make the game more strategic and social. Granted, some of those features existed in previous Battlefield games already, but if you happened to be coming straight from 1942 to this game, you'd be surprised how well it keeps up with modern conventions. Even the controls work just fine, and I actually found the notoriously hard-to-fly fighter planes, well, much easier to fly. (There's also an included tutorial to help out with that.)<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1017991-bf1943_screens_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1017991\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1017991-bf1943_screens_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1017991\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1017991-bf1943_screens_001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You might actually be able to fly well with a thumb stick.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The worst thing you could say about 1943 is that the online infrastructure hasn't worked very well since its release almost a week ago--which is, honestly, a pretty damning thing to say about an online-only game. In the case of the Xbox Live Arcade version,\u00a0for part of that time\u00a0it barely worked at all. EA was woefully unprepared to handle the player load at launch; it was nearly impossible to get into a game at all for the first couple of days, and even once it was possible to consistently join matches with strangers, I still had issues for a couple more days getting into my friends' games. The PlayStation Network fared much better, though I also had a similar issue joining friends' games on the PS3, which gave me the option to join but then inexplicably told me the game \"appeared to be unavailable.\" If nothing else, more descriptive error messages (even a simple \"match is full\") would have demystified and lessened the frustration with these server issues.<br/><br/> Now, six days after launch, Battlefield 1943 is working more or less like it's supposed to, and EA says it's committed to ironing out the few lingering network issues. There's more content on the way; the fourth map, a naval and air-only battle called Coral Sea, should unlock in a matter of hours on the Xbox 360 and later this week on the PS3 (as both player bases work toward the 43 million kill requirement). The shaky launch was a blight on DICE's service record, and Battlefield 1943 tested--and almost surpassed--my patience for launch-day online problems. But anyone buying the game now will simply find an intense, replayable multiplayer shooter that's fully worthy of both the Battlefield name and the price of entry.", "deck": "Despite some frustrating early network issues, this lean, mean sequel to the grandaddy of all Battlefield games still has it where it counts.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-179/", "platforms": null, "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25262/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/battlefield-1943/3030-25262/", "id": 25262, "name": "Battlefield 1943"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-07-13 21:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/blazblue-calamity-trigger-review/1900-181/", "description": "<br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/941043-blazb04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941043\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/941043-blazb04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941043\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/941043-blazb04.jpg\"></a><figcaption>   The story mode wants you to play through a series of poorly written tales for each character.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>   If we could post some kind of chart that would track my interest level in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21768\" href=\"/blazblue-calamity-trigger/3030-21768/\" slug=\"blazblue-calamity-trigger\"> BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger</a>, it would start out pretty high. Going in as someone who played a fair amount of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-570\" href=\"/arc-system-works-co-ltd/3010-570/\" slug=\"arc-system-works-co-ltd\"> Arc System Works</a>' <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22812\" href=\"/battle-fantasia/3030-22812/\" slug=\"battle-fantasia\"> Battle Fantasia</a> and at least enjoyed the early games in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-287\" href=\"/guilty-gear/3025-287/\" slug=\"guilty-gear\"> Guilty Gear</a> line, I was definitely interested in seeing what they could do in another new, non-Guilty-Gear sort of game. Upon actually playing it, I was pretty disappointed by a lot of the character design and basics of how it played. Over time, I figured out what's what with the various systems of BlazBlue, but it felt like the more I learned about how to play the game well, the less I enjoyed it. While there's nothing broken about the gameplay in BlazBlue, the fighting genre's recently revitalized and re-popularized state gives players plenty of recent options to choose from. So it's pretty tough for me to imagine anyone willingly choosing BlazBlue given the other games that are out there.<br/> <br/>    BlazBlue has been described as a spiritual successor to Arc's Guilty Gear series, and it shows. The game makes use of large, well-animated fighters and colorful backgrounds. It also seems to constantly pump screaming guitar rock out of the speakers at every possible moment. It even plays fast and loose with the English language, referring to rounds as \"rebels\" for reasons I'll probably never quite understand. While the games certainly aren't identical, it definitely feels like a game made for fans of Guilty Gear to play when they aren't playing Guilty Gear.<br/> <br/>    Not that Guilty Gear or BlazBlue are so esoteric that they're unrecognizable to outsiders. BlazBlue's most interesting element is that one of the game's four buttons--the drive button--does something entirely different depending on which character you play. For more standard characters like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7830\" href=\"/ragna-the-bloodedge/3005-7830/\" slug=\"ragna-the-bloodedge\"> Ragna</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7855\" href=\"/jin-kisaragi/3005-7855/\" slug=\"jin-kisaragi\"> Jin</a>, they have drive-based attacks that have extra effects, such as the ability to steal life from an opponent or freeze a foe solid for a few seconds. But then there's <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7821\" href=\"/rachel-alucard/3005-7821/\" slug=\"rachel-alucard\"> Rachel</a>, who can control the wind by pressing drive along with a direction, momentarily impacting projectiles and jumps for both players. Or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7859\" href=\"/carl-clover/3005-7859/\" slug=\"carl-clover\"> Carl</a>, a young boy who rolls around with a robot doll named Nirvana. When you hold drive while using Carl, you get direct control of Nirvana. This makes all of the characters feel pretty different, though it had the side effect of making me want to stick to one or two characters, rather than experiment with the entire roster. I'm sure Rachel's wind control is good for something, but I was left with zero desire to find out what.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/941055-blazb16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941055\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/941055-blazb16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-941055\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/941055-blazb16.jpg\"></a><figcaption> In combat you can double jump, cancel out of just about anything, and generally freak out and bounce around the screen.\u00a0</figcaption></figure> The rest of the game's systems are a bit easier to wrap your mind around. You've got a super meter that fills as you fight, allowing you to execute super attacks (\"distortion drives\") or, in the final round of a fight against an opponent with low health, you can attempt an astral heat, which instantly kills your foe with a flashy attack. The catch is that most of the players start out with their AHs locked, forcing you to complete arcade mode with each character to unlock all of the moves.<br/> <br/>    In addition to that standard arcade mode, there's also a standard training mode and a story mode that takes you through a ton of incredibly tedious dialogue about a story that I found to be absolutely indecipherable. Apparently there's some robot girl who has the face of some other girl? And she wants to merge with Ragna by killing him because he has some kind of beast inside of him? That's as close as I can get to describing what's happening here. Obviously, having a quality story isn't a necessity for a fighting game, but when you're devoting an entire separate mode to making your way through more dialogue than fights... with each character... you'd be right to expect something that resembles coherence. While it's certainly possible that it all makes sense when you clear every character's story, the nonsense you'd have to subject yourself to in order to see that moment is substantial and frightening.<br/> <br/>    The high point of BlazBlue is the way that its online is set up. In ranked matches, you see cards for each player as you're connecting that show off a win/loss record, player level, and the two characters that player chooses the most. In unranked games, up to six players can connect and rotate through fights as the other players spectate. However, you can't join an unranked match once a fight is happening, so finding rooms that are already running yet still joinable can be something of a pain unless you're coordinating with friends. In unranked games, you can alter the way players rotate in and out of a battle, disable the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8492\" href=\"/capcom-vs-snk-2-mark-of-the-millennium/3030-8492/\" slug=\"capcom-vs-snk-2-mark-of-the-millennium\"> Easy-Operation</a>-style controls that allow you to perform specials and supers using only the right analog stick, allow or disallow pumped-up \"unlimited\" versions of some characters, and so on. But the best part is that most of the online fights I've gotten into have been very smooth.<br/> <br/>    In addition to the game's aggressive soundtrack, there's a lot to BlazBlue's audio. Or, at least, it's very noisy. The characters are constantly shouting as you perform moves--moreso than in most other fighting games. There's also an announcer voice that calls out every counter by saying \"counter.\" Considering that you can counter almost anything in this game, it seems like the announcer is calling out counters every couple of seconds. All of the audio just becomes exhausting over time. Graphically, the game certainly has its technical chops, but it's at least as busy as the audio. The art style is probably a matter of taste, though. I found a lot of the character designs to be uninteresting. Sure, they animate well, but other than <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7856\" href=\"/iron-tager/3005-7856/\" slug=\"iron-tager\"> Iron Tager</a>\u00a0attempting to use a teensy cell phone in his win pose, I didn't really find a lot of charm with the way it all looks.<br/> <br/>    BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger is probably a game best suited for people who have been playing fighting games for a long time, but even then, its style seems to be deliberately divisive. It's certainly worth trying out if you're a fan of the genre, but it's entirely possible that you'll find the whole thing to be a big, loud mess.", "deck": "While there's certainly substance to Arc's 2D fighter, you have to dig through so many layers of loud music and flashy visuals that the whole experience becomes a bit exhausting.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-181/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21768/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/blazblue-calamity-trigger/3030-21768/", "id": 21768, "name": "BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-07-21 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83494/", "id": 83494, "name": "BlazBlue: Calamity Trigger"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-secret-of-monkey-island-review/1900-182/", "description": "<a data-ref-id=\"3010-644\" href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/\" slug=\"lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc\"> </a><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1082465-15.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082465\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54065934065934\" data-width=\"1365\" style=\"width: 1365px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1082465-15.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082465\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1099/1082465-15.png\"></a><figcaption>Meet Guybrush Threepwood, Mighty Pirate.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3010-644\" href=\"/lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc/3010-644/\" slug=\"lucasarts-entertainment-company-llc\">               LucasArts</a>, which seems to have wised up to the value of its adventure game back catalog after spending far too long ignoring it, recently revived its farcical swashbuckling adventure series with the episodic <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26776\" href=\"/tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-launch-of-the-screaming-narwhal/3030-26776/\" slug=\"tales-of-monkey-island-chapter-1-launch-of-the-screaming-narwhal\">              Tales of Monkey Island</a>. While this no doubt pleased plenty of grown folks with fond memories of insult duels and voodoo root beer, there are plenty more with no point of reference for genre conventions or the fiction of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-548\" href=\"/monkey-island/3025-548/\" slug=\"monkey-island\">             Monkey Island</a> series and the running gags and in-jokes that come with it. Both groups are served well by LucasArts' release of The Secret of Monkey Island Special Edition, a remake of the first game in the series that delivers modern production values without, ahem, monkeying with the goofy dialog trees, silly pirate talk, or loopy puzzle logic that defined the game in the first place. It's not without a few moments of awkwardness, but it's all minor stuff I found quite easy to forgive.<br/><br/>Set during a mythical and anachronistic age of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-445\" href=\"/pirates/3015-445/\" slug=\"pirates\">      pirates</a>, The Secret of Monkey Island opens up with a young knavish fellow named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-657\" href=\"/guybrush-threepwood/3005-657/\" slug=\"guybrush-threepwood\">            Guybrush Threepwood</a> rolling into the buccaneer-filled <a data-ref-id=\"3035-177\" href=\"/melee-island/3035-177/\" slug=\"melee-island\">           Melee Island</a> and declaring his desire to become a full-fledged pirate. Three important-looking pirates at the local <a data-ref-id=\"3035-385\" href=\"/scumm-bar/3035-385/\" slug=\"scumm-bar\">   grog-hole</a> send him off on a series of trials to test his worthiness, during which he gets caught up in a love triangle with the beautiful <a data-ref-id=\"3005-756\" href=\"/elaine-marley/3005-756/\" slug=\"elaine-marley\">          governor</a> of Melee Island and her ghostly suitor, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-762\" href=\"/lechuck/3005-762/\" slug=\"lechuck\">         LeChuck</a>. There is no shortage of silliness along the way, with the naive Guybrush forced to deal with bickering circus performers, a duplicitous sheriff, a shady treasure-map dealer, piranha poodles, an oily used boat salesman, and, of course, some monkeys. <br/><br/>The Secret of Monkey Island carries the usual adventure-game balance of dialog and puzzles, though when compared to more recent adventure games like the stuff <a data-ref-id=\"3010-397\" href=\"/telltale-games/3010-397/\" slug=\"telltale-games\">        Telltale</a>'s been doing, it's both more complex and more challenging. Its <a data-ref-id=\"3015-429\" href=\"/scumm/3015-429/\" slug=\"scumm\"> SCUMM</a> engine roots give you a number of ways to interact with other characters, the environment, and inventory items, creating incredible versatility as well as lots of dead-ends to scour when you find yourself stuck. It's easy enough to hit the internet for walk-throughs, though the game does one better by having a hint system built right in. Simply hold the X button and the game will gently nudge you in the right direction. If that's not enough, each subsequent use of the hint system becomes more explicit, and eventually, big fat yellow arrows will pop up, telling you exactly where you need to go next. It's something that eliminates much of the frustration that's inherent to adventure games, though once you start using it, it can be hard to stop, and one of the great pleasures of adventure games is solving a puzzle that you thought was impossible.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1082409-63.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082409\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5400390625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1082409-63.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1082409\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1099/1082409-63.png\"></a><figcaption>If the new art doesn't suit you, this is always an option.</figcaption></figure>  All of the graphics in this Special Edition have been completely redrawn with great detail, making the game much better suited for play on a nice big HDTV. Each screen is quite faithful to the layouts of the original, though the new art is a bit more stylized. While I don't love the overt foppishness that Guybrush's new physique implies, what's more bothersome is that, for all the detail found in every screen, it seems to maintain the same number of animation frames as the original, which can lead to some jerky looking movement. This Special Edition also takes all of the original control options off the screen, relegating them to contextual button presses and speedy submenus. It's definitely a change of pace, but it's something that I think makes the game far more suitable for a gamepad. <br/><br/>In addition to a lush new instrumentation on the soundtrack and some nice ambient sounds, all of the dialog is now spoken. Sometimes the voice work isn't a perfect fit--Stan the used-boat salesman sounds more like a game show host than anything--but some smart choices can also lead to jokes that simply didn't exist in the original. If, for whatever reason, you'd rather experience The Secret of Monkey Island as it originally looked and sounded, you can tap the Back button to toggle back and forth between the two versions on the fly, though I found this to be a fleeting novelty.<br/><br/>It's been long enough since I last played The Secret of Monkey Island that, despite the age of the source material, the experience still felt fresh. There are definitely moments where you can feel its age, and there's the distinct possibility that you remember The Secret of Monkey Island being funnier than it is, but this Special Edition is still a terrific way for both fans of the old point-and-click adventure games to revisit a classic, and for newcomers to get acquainted with it.", "deck": "Nearly twenty years later, the humor and the puzzles of this seminal LucasArts adventure game still hold up, and the new production values help it feel fresh again.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-182/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-3019/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-secret-of-monkey-island/3030-3019/", "id": 3019, "name": "The Secret of Monkey Island"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-07-21 19:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84267/", "id": 84267, "name": "The Secret of Monkey Island: Special Edition"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wii-sports-resort-review/1900-183/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044167-rvl_wsportsr_02ss06_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044167\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54807692307692\" data-width=\"832\" style=\"width: 832px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044167-rvl_wsportsr_02ss06_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044167\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2788/1044167-rvl_wsportsr_02ss06_e3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Playing tennis?

It was easy to grasp, but had enough of a hook to it to keep people coming back whether they'd played a thousand games or just one. It showcased the Wii's motion-sensing controls and let you know what they were all about. But beyond all of that, it was, at its core, fun. Simple, basic, fun.<br/> <br/> While that experience is the one that launched millions of sales for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\"> Nintendo</a>'s console, it's been a bit of a bumpy road for those of us with years of gaming experience. As developers chase after the millions of Wii owners who don't have a lot of hours spent with more traditional games, we've seen tons of games that attempt to duplicate the simple successes of Wii Sports. But very few of these cash-ins have succeeded. All of this makes Nintendo's return to sports-themed minigames that much sweeter. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21098\" href=\"/wii-sports-resort/3030-21098/\" slug=\"wii-sports-resort\"> Wii Sports Resort</a> offers more variety and a bit more complexity without alienating that family up the street who only bought a Wii because they love bowling. Unless you're the kind of sullen misanthrope who can only feel at peace when getting headshots with some kind of virtual scope, you'll surely find something about Wii Sports Resort that keeps both you and your non-gaming friends or family coming back for more.<br/> <br/> As the first game that actually requires you to have a <a data-ref-id=\"3000-25\" href=\"/wii-motionplus/3000-25/\" slug=\"wii-motionplus\"> Wii MotionPlus</a>, Resort is the big showcase for Nintendo's sensitivity-enhancing brick, and it works very well. Wii Sports Resort and the MotionPlus combine to finally make good on all the promises that the Wii originally made back in 2006. Remember all the dopey models, hiding behind couches and twisting on-screen swords with lifelike precision? With the MotionPlus attached, everything feels just a bit closer to that reality. It's probably most noticeable in the sword fighting game, where you have to swing at multiple angles to get around your opponent's defense. The sword stuff ended up being my favorite game of the lot, actually. It just feels right.<br/> <br/>In addition to the swordplay, there are 11 other types of games to play with in Wii Sports Resort. Odds are you won't love all of them. Me, I found canoeing, cycling, Frisbee, and power cruising to be my least favorite. Canoeing is just kind of tedious, though the act of paddling your canoe is fairly lifelike. Cycling doesn't replicate the act of riding a bike very well, asking you to shake a Remote and Nunchuk up and down to pedal and move them sideways to steer. Frisbee--which lets you play Frisbee golf or attempt to throw the disc at specific targets--seems really cool in theory, but I'm absolutely awful at it. And as much as you want power cruising to be the second coming of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-879\" href=\"/wave-race/3025-879/\" slug=\"wave-race\"> Wave Race</a>, it's <i>never</i> going to be the second coming of Wave Race.

Just like the real thing, it's all in the wrist, as twisting your wrist will apply spin to the ball. It brings more depth to an experience that would otherwise be strictly timing-based. There's also archery, where you draw the Nunchuk back like you're drawing a bow, take aim, and fire in a variety of situations. As the wind increases and your targets start moving, this becomes pretty tricky. The basketball game is mostly a three-point competition that feels like it rewards proper jump shot form. There's also a variant that lets you play three-on-three. This is nice because it lets you execute slam dunks by slamming the Wii Remote home after getting around the defenders, but it takes so many liberties with the rules of basketball that it's kind of clunky.<br/> <br/> Golf and bowling both appeared in the original Wii Sports, and they're back in Resort. The main differences I noticed was that bowling felt a lot easier because you have a higher level of spin control on your shots. That same wrist twisting made golf a lot harder for me at first. I probably spent 30 minutes slicing shots into the rough before working out the kinks in my faux-swing, keeping my wrists straight, and getting a good feel for how much power is enough power. That said, they're still very similar to their counterparts from the previous game.<br/> <br/> There's also an air sports section where you can sky dive or fly a plane around the island. The sky diving almost seems like a tutorial designed to get you used to moving the Remote with the Wii MotionPlus attached. The flying is interesting because it lets you see the whole island, where every event takes place. You can buzz the area where the sword duels take place, see the different cycling courses from the sky, and so on. But that and the two-player dogfighting aren't strong enough to keep you coming back.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/205194-6_wiisportsresort_screen_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-205194\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54807692307692\" data-width=\"832\" style=\"width: 832px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/205194-6_wiisportsresort_screen_06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-205194\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/205194-6_wiisportsresort_screen_06.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/205194-6_wiisportsresort_screen_06.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>If you can toss this Frisbee to this dog with any level of accuracy, you're a better person than I.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>All of these events are based around the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2185\" href=\"/wuhu-island/3035-2185/\" slug=\"wuhu-island\"> tropical island of Wuhu</a>.

It's not dramatically better than my memory of the original Wii Sports, but when you compare the two side by side, you can tell which one is newer.<br/> <br/>By offering 12 events and covering a variety of different styles, Nintendo has almost ensured that anyone who remotely liked anything about the original Wii Sports will find Wii Sports Resort to be a lot of fun. On top of that, it's still just as accessible as the original was, making it a great choice if you're looking for games to play with people who don't play a lot of games. You know what?

It doesn't totally revolutionize a long-standing genre, but it makes interesting changes to the well-worn formulas of its forefathers while sucking you in with its stylish look and kick-ass soundtrack. The only real drawback is that the game contains about an afternoon's worth of content and isn't especially difficult, which doesn't lead to a very replayable game unless you're the type of player who values your place on an online leaderboard.\u00a0<br/><br/> While most post-Arkanoid block breaking games have followed very closely in <a data-ref-id=\"3010-135\" href=\"/taito-corporation/3010-135/\" slug=\"taito-corporation\"> Taito</a>'s footsteps, Shatter only has a few actual collectable bonuses. Instead, most of your time spent with Shatter involves manipulating your paddle's innate power to suck and blow. Sucking in lets you collect particles that fill up a power meter that powers both a shield and a super attack that lets you shoot at blocks for a short period of time. But it also affects the trajectory of the ball. Blowing, as you might have guessed, is the opposite of sucking, and it'll repel your ball, as well as any loose blocks that might drift in your direction. So in addition to simply hitting the ball to keep it in play, the core skill of Shatter lies in using the suck and blow functions to manipulate the ball and aim it at the blocks you're trying to break. Since there are different types of blocks--some of which put their own spin on the ball as it draws near--there's a certain level of strategy involved in attempting to hit certain blocks first. This is the key to the entire experience and it's what makes Shatter much more than yet another Arkanoid clone.<br/> <br/> The levels in Shatter also come at you from a few different angles. The game starts out horizontally, with your paddle on the left side of the screen. But eventually you'll encounter vertical stages, and finally stages that take place in a circle, with your paddle able to cover a chunk of territory near the bottom of the circle. It would have been nice to see more angles and more variety in level design, as you see a little too much of each perspective as you work your way through the game's ten worlds. Each world, however, ends in a unique boss fight. You'll fight large creatures, like techno-snakes and cyber-squids, as well as a larger, meaner version of your paddle. The boss fights are pretty cool, and beating the game leads to a boss rush mode where you'll attempt to beat all of the bosses in the shortest time possible. There's a trophy in it for you if you can beat all ten in less than ten minutes... that's not an easy feat.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1078178-shatter_playstation_3_ps3_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1078178\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1078178-shatter_playstation_3_ps3_002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1078178\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/45471/1078178-shatter_playstation_3_ps3_002.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The later levels in Shatter can get pretty frantic.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Shatter plays really well and keeps you engaged from start to finish by giving you such direct control over the ball and changing things up just enough from level to level. But you'd probably get pretty tired of it very quickly if it wasn't for the game's killer presentation. Shatter looks great, with different color schemes and backgrounds for each world. It also sounds great. The Shatter soundtrack is a terrific collection of melodic electronic music that really stands out as the best thing about the entire game. It's available for purchase separately for a price that's actually higher than the game itself, but I found that purchase to also be totally worth it.<br/> <br/> There isn't any direct multiplayer in Shatter, leaving you to compete against an online leaderboard. But the game integrates these scores very well into the game by showing you the next score to beat from anyone on your friends list. This gives you a set of achievable targets as you work your way through the game. It's a great implementation that personalizes the chase for higher scores.<br/> <br/> So with that in mind, Shatter is best-suited to people who have a friends list full of scoreboard fiends. That's what'll bring replay value to a game that's only going to take you a couple of hours to see in its entirety. But even if you're not that type of player, Shatter still has enough style and action in it to be worth checking out.", "deck": "Shatter's a solid download that offers a terrific sense of style while also bringing you a really good update of the old Breakout/Arkanoid formula.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-184/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26465/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/shatter/3030-26465/", "id": 26465, "name": "Shatter"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-07-27 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-85018/", "id": 85018, "name": "Shatter"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes-review/1900-185/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/366190-10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366190\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/366190-10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366190\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2748/366190-10.jpg\"></a><figcaption>In some cases, all six characters might be on the screen at the same time.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The 2009 digital re-release of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2612\" href=\"/marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes/3030-2612/\" slug=\"marvel-vs-capcom-2-new-age-of-heroes\">Marvel vs. Capcom 2</a> is a no-nonsense version of a beloved fighting game. It's the same game you may have played in arcades or on the Dreamcast back in 2000, but now it has online play. Nicely functional online play, I might add. Also, it sidesteps all of the character-unlocking steps you had to take in previous versions of the game by giving you everything there is to get, right off the bat. It doesn't redraw the graphics and it doesn't rebalance the gameplay. If you love Marvel vs. Capcom 2, and you want to play it online, this is a good value at $15.00.<br/> <br/> Of course, if you're not already familiar with the game, you'll probably want to know a bit more about this <a data-ref-id=\"3025-173\" href=\"/marvel/3025-173/\" slug=\"marvel\">Marvel</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a> thing. As the name indicates, this game brings together characters from the Marvel Comics universe and characters from Capcom's lengthy history in the world of video gaming. This 2D fighter is a three-on-three tag battle game that follows in the footsteps of Capcom's previous Versus games. The Versus games are differentiated from the company's other 2D fighters by being... totally crazy. While it starts with the basics of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-331\" href=\"/street-fighter/3025-331/\" slug=\"street-fighter\">Street Fighter</a> at its core, it quickly goes off the rails in ways you may find amazing or totally baffling. Stoic, measured <a data-ref-id=\"3005-103\" href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\" slug=\"ryu\">Ryu</a> can now throw fireballs as tall as he is, and he can throw them in the air. In fact, most moves can be done in the air, and everyone can jump something like twice the height of the screen.<br/> <br/> The super moves are ridiculous, screen-filling maneuvers that can be chained together with the other characters in your party. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-18\" href=\"/combo/3015-18/\" slug=\"combo\">Combos</a> numbering in the hundreds are fairly common, and combos numbering in the thousands are certainly possible, too. It's kind of a lot to take in, and if you aren't up on it, the game can get a little overwhelming. Heck, even the character select screen can be hard to deal with when you're first getting started. With 56 characters to choose from, you'll have plenty of dudes to sift through as you figure out your ideal team. But let me be clear: this game might contain too much crazy to be any fun for players who aren't already into it. At the very least, new players should strive to find other groups of new players to fight against, because playing against seasoned players only results in frustration of the \"well I'm just going to set my controller down while you finish this combo\" variety.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/366198-13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366198\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2748/366198-13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-366198\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2748/366198-13.jpg\"></a><figcaption>She's a member of STARS!\u00a0</figcaption></figure>As far as modes go, it has the standard arcade mode and a training mode, but multiplayer is, of course, where you'll find the real action. You can play ranked one-on-one matches or unranked games that hold up to six players, who rotate through as matches finish while the non-active players spectate. The online seems to be of the same quality as Super Street Fighter II Turbo HD Remix's, which is to say that it's great and seems to work perfectly more often than not. Of course, this is the Internet we're talking about here, so don't be surprised to see some less-than-ideal matches here and there.<br/> <br/> The graphics in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 haven't been updated, but there are a few sprite-filtering options to choose from. Additionally, the game defaults to a zoomed-in perspective that fills 16:9 screens. The original game ran in 4:3, and if you like, you can force it to that aspect ratio. Considering the verticality of MvC2, I think I prefer the original screen size, but that's more a matter of preference. It's a nice option to have, either way. It's also worth noting that the music in Marvel vs. Capcom 2 is awful. Actually, I appreciate its awfulness in some cases, like the character select screen's short loop that repeats that it's going to \"take you for a ride.\" But most of the tracks are pseudo-jazzy tunes that really don't fit with the action very well at all.<br/> <br/> So if you're a fan of the game, you've probably already purchased it. But if you haven't gotten into a previous version of MvC2, it's going to be a steep climb, especially if you hope to compete online. As someone who understands the basics of the game but doesn't always apply them in the most intelligent way, I was getting absolutely stomped in most of the ranked games I played. Don't expect to be able to take any skills you've picked up in other recent fighting games, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\" href=\"/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iv\">Street Fighter IV</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21768\" href=\"/blazblue-calamity-trigger/3030-21768/\" slug=\"blazblue-calamity-trigger\">BlazBlue</a>, and apply them here to any great effect. Yes, you're still making fireball and dragon punch motions for specials, but the mentality is certainly different.

But looking back on this lengthy 2D platformer, I'll lean toward praise, because 'Splosion Man is every bit as satisfying, fun, and charmingly oddball as it is grueling to complete.<br/> <br/> In 'Splosion Man you're some kind of science experiment gone wrong, a walking, quipping fireball who, well, 'splodes every chance he gets. You explode to jump, explode to attack, explode to do just about everything. Exploding lets you kill robotic enemies and innocuous but no doubt nefarious lab-coated scientists; bust through obstacles and throw switches and levers; and bounce off of ubiquitous barrels and explosive toxic waste to catch huge amounts of air. It's the one and only way you do everything in the game, making this a pretty simple game to play (but, as the saying goes, a hard one to master).<br/> <br/> The 50 or so levels of the single-player game in 'Splosion Man are all set up like elaborate, breakneck puzzles that demand split-second precision as you navigate increasingly--and after a while, insanely--complex combinations of wall jumps, triple jumps, moving platforms, lethal laser barriers, conveyor belts, rising flood waters, crushing spiked pistons, pursuing giant robots... all flying at you, or you at them, at a thousand miles an hour. (If reading about the action seems tiring, you should try playing it.)<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29267/1083690-959210_07012009_790screen017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083690\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29267/1083690-959210_07012009_790screen017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083690\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29267/1083690-959210_07012009_790screen017.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Seriously, this is only the beginning.</figcaption></figure>And if you're going to play 'Splosion Man, prepare to be frustrated. There is zero margin for error in each precisely plotted action sequence. The game expects you to hit your marks without fail, forcing you to always be ready to jump at exactly the right time and often react to obstacles and challenges almost before you can see them, much less prepare for them. Some sections simply require rote repetition and memorization before you can pass them; there were a few parts I must have tried two or three dozen times before completing. But only one sequence in one level of the entire game felt truly cheap; the rest were just a matter of practice and timing. As any fan of old '80s arcade and home action games knows, mastering that style of gameplay can be quite satisfying in its own right. Just ask Billy Mitchell.<br/> <br/>I can't fault Twisted Pixel for this sort of unforgiving design. The game gets a pass, barely, because it mitigates the frustration level by doing everything it can, short of actually lightening the challenge itself. You have unlimited lives, and you hit a checkpoint between every puzzle or action sequence. When you die, you respawn at the last checkpoint instantly, with no loading time. The little scorch-mark textures you leave behind when you wall-jump even remain when you die and respawn, as if to preserve cues for you to remember precisely the right--and wrong--places to jump.<br/> <br/> The single-player in 'Splosion Man is so intensely focused on speed and timing, you wouldn't expect it to translate well into a multiplayer mode, but it does. The game has a completely different set of multiplayer levels for up to four different-colored 'Splosion Men to get in on simultaneously, and the co-op works because the level design here is less about navigating split-second traps and more about methodical puzzles that make all the players work together. (Some of the puzzles even tailor themselves to the number of players in the game.) There are a couple of ingenious additions to the co-op that really tie it together: two players can explode off of each other in midair to get a big jump, and anyone can initiate a color-coded onscreen 3-2-1 countdown that makes it startlingly easy for you to communicate your intentions and time your jumps. I managed to get through several levels with a couple of other players without even using voice chat, which is an impressive feat when you think about it.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29267/1083705-959210_07012009_790screen032.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083705\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29267/1083705-959210_07012009_790screen032.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1083705\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29267/1083705-959210_07012009_790screen032.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29267/1083705-959210_07012009_790screen032.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brace for frustration.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Humor is the real ace up 'Splosion Man's sleeve, and anyone who played Twisted Pixel's last effort <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23112\" href=\"/the-maw/3030-23112/\" slug=\"the-maw\"> The Maw</a> will know the sort of lovable lunacy to expect here, from the ridiculous, madcap soundtrack to the silly poses and inexplicable <a data-ref-id=\"3040-7493\" href=\"/arnold-schwarzenegger/3040-7493/\" slug=\"arnold-schwarzenegger\"> Arnold Schwarzenegger</a> quotes that come out of 'Splosion Man himself.

Over the years, the roster in the KOF series has grown and shrunk, move lists have expanded and contracted, and the standard three-on-three format has been tweaked around a bit. But one thing remained constant over the last decade: the character sprites. Until they released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10674\" href=\"/garou-mark-of-the-wolves/3030-10674/\" slug=\"garou-mark-of-the-wolves\"> Mark of the Wolves</a> and changed up his look a bit, you could always count on <a data-ref-id=\"3005-34\" href=\"/terry-bogard/3005-34/\" slug=\"terry-bogard\"> Terry Bogard</a> to be standing there, in his jacket and hat, shouting \"hey c'mon c'mon\" at his opponent. But for the duration of the series, the game looked roughly the same. That's part of why <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21519\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-xii/3030-21519/\" slug=\"the-king-of-fighters-xii\"> King of Fighters XII</a> feels like such an event. All of the characters have been redrawn. They're now larger on-screen, and more frames of animation are used. But even under all the fancy new art, the game still feels like KOF.<br/> <br/> At the same time, KOF XII doesn't exactly feel like a great deal. The roster of 22 characters is pretty small by series standards, and fan favorites like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-182\" href=\"/mai-shiranui/3005-182/\" slug=\"mai-shiranui\"> Mai Shiranui</a> are nowhere to be found. Also, the game is missing a lot of the little extras that gave the series its charm, like the special intro animations used in past entries to highlight rivalries between characters. Also, the game's arcade mode feels like it was thrown in without any thought to making it more than just a series of fights. You create a team and fight five teams as a time trial. Your score is the time it takes you to complete all of the fights. Other than a couple of cutscenes that talk about the nature of the time trials, there's really nothing else to it. There's no final boss, no character-specific storylines, nothing.<br/> <br/> Without a meaningful single-player experience to fall back on, KOF XII is very dependent on the quality of its multiplayer. Naturally, this is at its best when you're playing against another local player, but the game also has an online mode. The online feels pretty spotty on both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360, even after a set of patches designed to improve the online performance were released during the game's week of release. I've certainly encountered some matches that ran just fine, but more often than not, the game teeters on the edge of unplayability. It's too bad, because the online mode has a good set of features, including a six-player quarter match style of setup. On the PS3, there's a cool option for creating and managing clans.<br/> <br/> It's a shame that the online and all of the other stuff that surrounds King of Fighters XII's gameplay isn't better, because the actual fighting game itself is really sharp. It sticks pretty close to the series' conventions, but breaks rank in a few spots by adding the \"guard attack,\" which is a move that turns a block into a counter if timed properly. There's also a \"blow back attack,\" which feels sort of similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\" href=\"/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iv\"> Street Fighter IV</a>'s focus attacks. If you hit someone with a fully charged blow back, it crumples them, setting you up for a follow-up attack. There's also a \"critical counter\" system that, when triggered, lets you unleash a quick flurry of attacks, almost like a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1328\" href=\"/street-fighter-alpha-3/3030-1328/\" slug=\"street-fighter-alpha-3\"> Street Fighter Alpha 3</a> V-ism combo. The different systems are interesting and merge with the standard four-button SNK style pretty well.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/922137-kofxii12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-922137\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56266666666667\" data-width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/19745/922137-kofxii12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-922137\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/19745/922137-kofxii12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll fight in huge arenas at the start and end of the arcade mode.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The presentation in KOF XII is fine, but there aren't very many backgrounds to choose from. The characters are well-animated, but sometimes look weirdly blocky. You can turn on a few different filters to blur the blocky edges a bit, but at some point this just makes the fighters look very blurry against a very sharp background. If you're just directly comparing it to the previous King of Fighters games, it looks really impressive. But if you're looking at other modern fighting games, it's merely nice. The in-game music is fine, but the default English voices are kind of terrible. Also, there's a real lack of variety there. Hearing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-197\" href=\"/kyo-kusanagi/3005-197/\" slug=\"kyo-kusanagi\"> Kyo</a> say \"how do you like that heat?\" after every fight gets tired after around two fights. I ended up switching to the Japanese language track very quickly.<br/> <br/> The fighting at the center of King of Fighters XII is totally fine, but with everything surrounding that action coming off so half-cocked, there are a lot of annoying little barriers to enjoying that fighting.

Look out!</figcaption></figure>  And with Mothership Zeta, we reach the fifth and (supposedly) final downloadable episode for <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\" href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" slug=\"fallout-3\">     Fallout 3</a>. If this is indeed the end, it's a fairly fitting summation of both the highs and lows of how Bethesda has handled the expansion of its post-apocalyptic role-playing game. Previous episodes have taken us outside the confines of the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2158\" href=\"/the-capital-wasteland/3035-2158/\" slug=\"the-capital-wasteland\">    Capital Wasteland</a>, but Mothership Zeta represents the greatest departure from that familiar place, both literally and figuratively. As agreeable as I find the premise of a good old-fashioned alien abduction story filtered through the gallows humor of Fallout 3, I'm disappointed by how combat-focused Mothership Zeta is. It's not without a few interesting characters and some good set-piece moments, but the constant corridor crawling can be fatiguing.<br/><br/>As per usual, Mothership Zeta slips itself into the Fallout 3 continuity by way of a mysterious radio signal that you pick up, one that leads you to a crashed alien spaceship in the Capital Wasteland. Approach the ship, and the next thing you know, you're being held captive as a guinea pig miles above the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-65\" href=\"/earth/3035-65/\" slug=\"earth\">   Earth</a> in that titular mothership, a massive starship full of marauding little green men and their test subjects. You'll form an interesting little rag-tag group of abductees as you make your way through the ship and try to figure a way off it, though you'll be spending most of your time running solo through the ship's winding corridors, murdering wave after wave of ill-tempered aliens and blowing up every power generator you can find. <br/><br/>These are the two aspects of Mothership Zeta that I take issue with: structure and variety. Once you're on the ship, your sole concern is getting off the ship. There are a few distinct steps to this process, but they usually come down to fighting a bunch of aliens and then blowing up a power generator. The whole thing plays out a little more predictably than I'd hope, without any of the terrific left-field twists or the queasy bad-or-worse moral choices that have been the hallmark of Fallout 3's best missions. The aliens are formidable foes, and the sleek energy weapons they drop will serve you well once you return to the wastes, but there's effectively only three types of enemies that you'll face in Mothership Zeta, and you do enough fighting that you definitely could've used more.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1095617-mothershipzeta_zeta.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1095617\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1095617-mothershipzeta_zeta.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1095617\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1095617-mothershipzeta_zeta.jpg\"></a><figcaption>And you thought things looked bad from the ground.</figcaption></figure>  Aesthetically, Mothership Zeta tries to do for the 1950s sci-fi vision of an alien invasion what Fallout 3 did for the 1950s sci-fi vision of the future, a task that it's intermittently successful at. The aliens themselves look like slightly more sinister versions of your traditional little green men, and all the smooth stainless steel surfaces and indiscernible alien technology are unlike anything you've seen in the Capital Wasteland. It doesn't feel like you're looking at a lot of recycled content, but it also doesn't feel so much <i>alien</i> as it does futuristic in a different way from the rest of Fallout 3. That's not to say it isn't a fully realized location, but the fingerprints of human design are all over Mothership Zeta.<br/><br/>What's most interesting to me is the interplay between the alien abduction premise of Mothership Zeta and the savage, nothing-to-lose world of Fallout 3. Usually when you're dealing with an alien invasion, the whole world is at stake, so what happens when the aliens arrive and we've already blown the place up? These are two sci-fi staples that rarely co-exist, and Mothership Zeta provides a different perspective on the world below. <br/><br/>There's something so audacious to me about stacking aliens on top of the apocalypse, and Mothership Zeta does it well enough that I'm willing to excuse some of its structural bluntness and over-reliance on combat. It's not the best Fallout 3 DLC, but it's still pretty interesting, and not a bad way to spend four or five hours.", "deck": "Adding an alien invasion to the bleak, post-apocalyptic world of Fallout 3 is conceptually quite pleasing, though Mothership Zeta suffers from its narrow path, and it leans more on combat and less on character than it should.", "dlc_name": "Operation: Anchorage", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-188/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20504/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fallout-3/3030-20504/", "id": 20504, "name": "Fallout 3"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-08-05 15:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-turtles-in-time-re-sh/1900-189/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1088371-t5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1088371\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.52753623188406\" data-width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1088371-t5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1088371\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1088371-t5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Turtles on the high seas.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>If you pumped your share of quarters into any of the innumerable beat-'em-ups of yesteryear's arcades--games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6722\" href=\"/final-fight/3030-6722/\" slug=\"final-fight\"> Final Fight</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20752\" href=\"/double-dragon/3030-20752/\" slug=\"double-dragon\"> Double Dragon</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23408\" href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles/3030-23408/\" slug=\"teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles\"> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>--then a high-definition 3D update to any one of those games might sound like a great idea to you. But that's probably because you haven't <i>played</i> any of those old games since they were popular and thus have not yet come to the belated realization that these games are actually pretty simple and boring by today's standards.<br/> <br/> Such is the new Xbox Live Arcade remake of the second Ninja Turtles arcade game, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27063\" href=\"/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-turtles-in-time-re-shelled/3030-27063/\" slug=\"teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-turtles-in-time-re-shelled\"> Turtles in Time</a>. The game has been \"re-shelled\" with bland 3D graphics (at the expense of the more memorable 2D originals), and you can now attack along the Y axis in addition to the X, but otherwise this is the same four-player bash-fest filled with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-87\" href=\"/shredder/3005-87/\" slug=\"shredder\"> Shredder</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2899\" href=\"/krang/3005-2899/\" slug=\"krang\"> Krang</a>, and countless <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6748\" href=\"/foot-clan/3005-6748/\" slug=\"foot-clan\"> Foot Clan</a> ninjas that you banged your head against in the early '90s. In terms of game mechanics this is a competently made game, but that doesn't make it very exciting to play.<br/> <br/> Like the original game, you can beat Re-Shelled in 90 minutes or less, as you jump through time from prehistory to a medieval pirate ship, the Old West to a spaceship in the future. But you're pretty much fighting the same Foot Clan grunts on every single level. Come to think of it, there aren't even any decent cutscenes in here to explain why you're bouncing from one epoch to the next. The whole game feels sort of thrown together and by-the-numbers.<br/> <br/> The four turtles do have slightly different attributes corresponding to attack speed, range, and so forth, but there's not a lot of depth to the combat. You can grab an enemy and pound him on the ground or throw him into the screen, and do a leaping attack that will knock down any opponents in front of you. But you can also pretty much button-mash your way through the entire game, which gets even easier as you add more players. The game is perfectly functional over Xbox Live, for what it's worth.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1088367-t2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1088367\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.52463768115942\" data-width=\"690\" style=\"width: 690px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1088367-t2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1088367\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1088367-t2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This game should look better.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The most damning thing about Re-Shelled to me personally is the absence of the original arcade game and its sprite-based graphics. Recent remakes like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22998\" href=\"/r-type-dimensions/3030-22998/\" slug=\"r-type-dimensions\"> R-Type Dimensions</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3019\" href=\"/the-secret-of-monkey-island/3030-3019/\" slug=\"the-secret-of-monkey-island\"> Secret of Monkey Island</a> have done a fantastic job of letting you transition seamlessly at the touch of a button between the gussied-up new visuals and the retro originals. Here, you're stuck with just the new 3D graphics, which are poorly detailed and would have been better served with a cel-shading effect, which would have at least evoked a cartoon or comic-book feel. It's also important to note (if only for the sake of nostalgic purists) that this is a remake of the original arcade game and not the Super NES version, so it lacks the extra content added to the latter game.<br/> <br/> Re-Shelled is stuck in this weird in-between place where it does no nostalgic service to the original game but also fails to bring anything new whatsoever to this simplistic genre. It does what it does well enough, but what it does just isn't that impressive anymore. On the upside, Microsoft is issuing the value of this game as a rebate to anyone who buys all five of the Summer of Arcade releases.

It takes a lot of first-person shooter tropes like large teams, player classes, flag captures, and seizable control points and drops them into a silly but ultra-violent cartoon world played from the overhead perspective. There's a lot more to the gameplay here than the cartoony art style might indicate, which is so common these days it's practically a clich\u00e9.<br/> <br/> Speaking of clich\u00e9s, Fat Princess initially had significant issues with connectivity and lag, just like a lot of other high profile online games lately. It took about a week for developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6505\" href=\"/titan-studios/3010-6505/\" slug=\"titan-studios\"> Titan Studios</a> to issue a patch that, fortunately, has made it much easier to get into online games--and smoother to play once you join them. If you've been waiting for the online issues to clear up before jumping in, they've cleared up. Now the only barrier to having fun in Fat Princess is making sure your teamwork is up to snuff.<br/> <br/> There's a lot of things happening in a typical Fat Princess match. The game uses a basic capture-the-flag framework, except the flag you're capturing is actually your kidnapped princess being held in the enemy's base. But you're also holding their princess hostage, and you can stuff her face with cake to fatten her up and make her harder for the enemy forces to carry back to their base--assuming they can breach yours in the first place. Each side's base is well-fortified with walls and other defenses, so just getting in there is a task in itself.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1103247-fp_sugar_cove_ss_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1103247\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1103247-fp_sugar_cove_ss_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1103247\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1103247-fp_sugar_cove_ss_20.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's a great variety of nice-looking maps in here.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>There are five character classes--warrior, ranger, priest, mage, and worker--each with one upgrade level that increases that class's offensive abilities. The worker is also responsible for collecting wood and stone resources that you'll need to upgrade your classes and also build special structures. For instance, there's a catapult you can build inside your own base that will launch several teammates across the map, and ladders you can quickly construct that will let you quickly scale the walls of your enemy's base. These additions contribute heavily to your team's mobility and chances of winning.<br/> <br/> You can dump gathered resources into any of multiple outposts on each map, but only if your team holds a given outpost. So there's a level of strategy not just in deciding which upgrades and structures to spend your own resources on, but also in trying to hold the right outposts to deny the other team the crucial resources they need to build their <i>own</i> add-ons and upgrades. Keeping the upper hand on that front can make a big difference to your chances of victory, and luckily, after over a week of release, the player base in my experience is learning the value of such strategic moves.<br/> <br/> If the flow of Fat Princess' matches is pretty tactical, the in-your-face combat is anything but. The game has a 16-versus-16 player limit, and that makes for a <i>lot</i> of little cartoon dudes and dudettes frantically flailing at each other on your screen. Throw in buckets of animated blood and flashy area-of-effect magic spells and it can be a little tough to keep up with where your own character is and what's happening at all times. The game is <i>almost</i> too chaotic for its own good, but you'll likely become skilled enough with the lock-on, strafing, and charge attack abilities to get a handle on the fighting after a few sessions. The fighting classes each fill different necessary roles--melee and ranged attacking, simple crowd control, and healing--and you'll probably want to get good at using all of them, since your team will need every class at one time or another in a given match.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1103227-fp_e3_nogore_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1103227\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.57734375\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1103227-fp_e3_nogore_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1103227\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1103227-fp_e3_nogore_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1103227-fp_e3_nogore_2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Controlling resources is a big part of winning matches.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>For $15, Fat Princess is nicely stocked with content. Most importantly, the game has a solid collection of nine regular maps with varied layouts and distinctly different art styles. There's a tropical map where your base is a pirate ship run ashore, and a rocky volcanic map where lava rises periodically to cut off access to certain resources.\u00a0The game looks absolutely fantastic, too; it combines cel-shading with an exaggerated style of animation to produce an effect that's strikingly like a really well-made cartoon.<br/>\u00a0<br/>The core and best part of the game is the CTF-style princess-grabbing mode, but you can also play reduced rule sets like a conquest mode and simple team deathmatch on them as well. There's even a marginally entertaining soccer-field map that lets you play a version of the sport with all the player classes mixed in, as well as offline modes that give you a very basic story-mode-slash-tutorial and a series of gladiator-style arena challenges for each class. Finally, you can unlock a stack of new colors and hairstyles to customize your cartoony little combatant as you rank up in the online mode. There are hooks built into the game for future DLC, but the basic package feels like a good value already.<br/> <br/>Despite its early growing pains, Fat Princess manages to walk a pretty straight path between frenzied combat and larger-scale tactics. It's a unique take on team-based multiplayer with a lot of personality and charm--and, with any luck, a lot of staying power on the PlayStation Network. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "The madcap cartoon warfare in this team-based online game is a lot of fun, provided your team knows how to work together.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-190/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21184/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fat-princess/3030-21184/", "id": 21184, "name": "Fat Princess"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-08-10 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83439/", "id": 83439, "name": "Fat Princess"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/gi-joe-the-rise-of-cobra-review/1900-191/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/946490-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-946490\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.475\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:47.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1379/946490-2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-946490\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1379/946490-2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The vehicles control really, really poorly.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>It's tempting to go after G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra's story and fiction because of all the dopey liberties it takes with the G.I. Joe source material. But those are the same liberties taken with the film upon which this game is based. So it's not the game's fault that Destro talks with a Scottish accent or that the redesigned Cobra Commander looks awful. Unfortunately, the <i>game</i> part of this licensed release is even worse. It's an awful shooter that requires no skill to play and manages to be almost completely impossible to enjoy, largely thanks to its atrocious camera. It looks and behaves like a bad downloadable game, yet still comes on a disc and sits on shelves with an asking price of $49.99. And though I haven't seen the film yet, I'm going to go out on a limb here and guess that even people who come away from the movie loving it still won't find any bright spots in this bad, bad shooter.<br/> <br/> The game puts you in the boots of several different members of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-223\" href=\"/gi-joe/3025-223/\" slug=\"gi-joe\"> G.I. Joe</a> as they fight against a still-rising Cobra. You work through four different areas, each with several missions. Along the way you'll find dog-tags that give you the option to unlock more characters, each with a different weapon. You eventually get the ability to unlock a few different members of Cobra, as well. This doesn't make much sense from a story perspective, and the throwaway line of dialogue at the beginning of such a mission, where <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9911\" href=\"/storm-shadow/3005-9911/\" slug=\"storm-shadow\"> Storm Shadow</a> makes some crammed-in comment about tainting his soul or something by working with the Joes doesn't really do much to explain it. But you get the impression that no one was really interested in making it all make sense, instead focusing on getting as many different classic characters from the franchise in there as possible. That's noble, but the occasional bit of fan service doesn't make the gameplay any better.<br/> <br/> The Rise of Cobra is a third-person shooter that feels like a misguided mix of classic arcade games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6850\" href=\"/commando/3030-6850/\" slug=\"commando\"> Commando</a> and modern shooters like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\"> Gears of War</a>. The camera is pulled back and moves automatically, but it also has (offline only) co-op play and a cover mechanic. Weirdly enough, you heal much faster when behind cover, but most of the cover is destructible, so when you need it most, it's not going to be there long enough to make a difference. Instead, you're better off making use of the game's roll button, which lets you flip out of the way and dodge incoming fire. The game does all of the aiming for you, so a lot of the action is of the \"hold up on the analog stick while holding the fire button\" variety. This gets incredibly annoying when you're trying to shoot at a specific target, as the right stick that's supposed to let you select different targets doesn't work very well at all. If you have two enemies ahead of you and want to shoot one instead of the other, it can be frustratingly difficult to get the auto-aim to obey. Half the time, the auto-aim seems to lock onto some off-screen object--usually a helpless box that gives you points when shot--and shoot at it until it's dead while you flail around trying to get it to aim at something that's actually shooting back at you.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-927442\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-927442\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/927442-mars_trooper_shield.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll have to run up and punch shielded enemies.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>On the game's default difficulty setting, there's very little difference between pass and fail. If you run out of health, your character goes down on one knee for a few seconds, then stands back up with full health. The only penalty is that you'll lose some of the points you've accumulated, resulting in a lower end-of-level ranking, which nets you fewer points to spend on unlocking additional characters. The higher difficulty settings add the possibility of failure and also have higher scoring multipliers, but adding some semblance of challenge to the proceedings doesn't really fix anything that's wrong with the game. It just means it'll take you more time to play a game you probably shouldn't be playing in the first place.<br/> <br/> In addition to the on-foot shooting, the game offers up a few vehicles and a satellite minigame where you blast ground troops with an orbital laser. While a break from the standard action is a good idea, the vehicle control is a mess. The laser minigame is decent, but that's also where I ran into an issue where the game wouldn't advance at the end of the minigame, leaving me stuck and forcing me to abort the mission and start over.<br/> <br/> But the occasional bug isn't what makes G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra a bad game. There's no one thing that you can point at here. Every little thing about it, from the bland presentation to the dead-simple gameplay, conspires to make the final product incredibly lame. It has the depth of a bad downloadable game with the price tag of a full-on retail release. It's the worst of both worlds.

Three hours later, I had cleared the game with 100 percent of the items collected. With that out of the way, I started over on a harder difficulty setting. That's the nature of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6270\" href=\"/chair-entertainment/3010-6270/\" slug=\"chair-entertainment\"> Chair Entertainment</a>'s side-scrolling action-adventure. There's enough to it to probably satisfy people who only like to complete single-player games once, but it's set up in a way that really inspires you to play it again and again.<br/> <br/> The game itself is an updated take on the great side-scrolling adventures of the past, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8292\" href=\"/super-metroid/3030-8292/\" slug=\"super-metroid\"> Super Metroid</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14216\" href=\"/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night/3030-14216/\" slug=\"castlevania-symphony-of-the-night\"> Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a>. Much like those games, you're presented with a large world that's sectioned off into areas that can't be accessed without specific items. So the game progresses as you fight your way through an underground facility, collecting new items and getting closer to figuring out what the heck is going on around there.<br/> <br/> The reason this facility is such a mystery is because you're not some super-secret mega spy. You're just some dude, enticed to go cave exploring in the Pacific Northwest because of some girl you met the night before. She's immediately captured, leaving you with nothing but a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-156\" href=\"/flashlight/3055-156/\" slug=\"flashlight\"> flashlight</a>. As it turns out, you've stumbled upon a base for the Progressive Restoration, some sort of secret terrorist force that's in the final stages planning an attack on <a data-ref-id=\"3035-191\" href=\"/san-francisco/3035-191/\" slug=\"san-francisco\"> San Francisco</a>, with designs to take over the entire country. As it turns out, they've teched the hell up, too, because the facility is churning out big mechanized units and some kind of super armor that you'll slowly piece together over the course of the game. The game's story is only really a factor in a few specific spots, as there's a real focus on the action. You'll only learn about your foes by overhearing conversations between enemy soldiers. It does, however, wrap up just fine at the end, both providing a touch of closure while giving you the impression that this budding conflict is far from over.<br/> <br/> Though you won't start with much, by the end of the game you'll amass quite the arsenal. Your weapon will upgrade from a simple pistol to some kind of killer auto-<a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\"> shotgun</a>. You'll get a jet pack that lets you <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1\" href=\"/double-jump/3015-1/\" slug=\"double-jump\"> double</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1565\" href=\"/triple-jump/3015-1565/\" slug=\"triple-jump\"> triple jump</a>. You'll get <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\"> grenades</a>, missiles, and a foam gun, each of which is used to open specific passages. The foam gun is cool because you can also use it to incapacitate enemies or attach it to walls to create walkways or platforms.\u00a0<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1084183-sc18.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1084183\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56171548117155\" data-width=\"956\" style=\"width: 956px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1084183-sc18.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1084183\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39552/1084183-sc18.png\"></a><figcaption>Jason's just this guy, you know?\u00a0</figcaption></figure>By default, the map screen in Shadow Complex provides you with a bright blue line that shows you exactly where to go next, along with a line of text detailing what you're supposed to be doing next. Playing this way makes the game feel pretty linear, but along the way it's easy to get curious about what's off in some other direction and start exploring. Exploring every little corner of the map is what gets you a ton of additional items. Most of it's just extra ammo capacity for your secondary weapons, but health tanks and armor upgrades become pretty vital, especially on the higher difficulty settings. You'll also find gold bars (which unlock a special little something if you get them all) and pass-key components that... well, it should suffice to say that every item in the game serves a pretty meaningful purpose.<br/> <br/> Unlike most other games of this sort, Shadow Complex utilizes the right stick for analog aiming. This lets you pick off head shots from a distance, nail guys from behind cover, and really makes the combat satisfying. The melee attacks, which cut away to up-close animations of enemies getting jacked, are also a lot of fun. You'll encounter a few larger enemies along the way, too. While most of them aren't involved enough to be considered full-on boss battles, things like spider-like walkers or little two-legged mechs get their own lifebars and take a bit more work to bring down. I found that just hammering on the grenade button until everything around you is dead is a good way to go for most of these bigger fights.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Fighting enemies also has another benefit--you earn experience points as you go, both for destroying enemies and simply exploring the facility.\u00a0You'll also earn an experience bonus for behaving in a more tactical manner, like getting headshots or using melee attacks. Every time you gain a level, you either earn a quick statistical boost, but every 10 levels you get something bigger, like a health increase, or infinite ammo for one of your secondary weapons, or something like that. The highest level is 50, and that's not a number that you're likely to hit on your first playthrough, but your level carries through from one session to the next. I finished the game at level 23, and after playing for another eight or so hours, I'm now in the mid-30s. Higher difficulty levels get your more experience, too, giving you a reason to pump things up to one of the harder settings.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>If you're looking to get away from the campaign, there are a series of challenge rooms to play through, as well. Each has its own leaderboard, letting you compete against friends for the best score. There are also leaderboards for things like melee attacks and head shots. Sort of like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5648\" href=\"/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/\" slug=\"burnout-paradise\"> Burnout Paradise</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26465\" href=\"/shatter/3030-26465/\" slug=\"shatter\"> Shatter</a>, Shadow Complex gives you leaderboard updates on the fly, so when you pass a friend's headshot count, a little pop-up lets you know. Seeing that pop-up made me go on an all-melee killing spree for an hour or so, just to distance myself from the pack. It's a terrific implementation of what's an otherwise standard feature in today's games.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1086421-shadowcomplex_screen18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1086421\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1086421-shadowcomplex_screen18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1086421\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1086421-shadowcomplex_screen18.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1086421-shadowcomplex_screen18.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll see a lot of different areas as you explore the facility.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Visually, the only time Shadow Complex reminds you that it's not a full retail product is in some of the cutscenes. Specifically, when your lady friend is shown up close, her face... doesn't look so great. You'll also occasionally see that trademark <a data-ref-id=\"3015-86\" href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" slug=\"unreal-engine-3\"> Unreal Engine 3</a> graphical quirk, where the low-res graphics load in and sit there for awhile before being replaced with the detailed visuals. But all in all, the game looks great. The base is large and detailed, and it makes great use of lighting to help set the mood. There's one spot where you're walking through a room that's lit in red, and you're backlit, so you just see Jason's silhouette walking through a red room. It's pretty striking, and it certainly helps set Shadow Complex apart from the pack when it comes to digitally-distributed console games. The music, also, exists to set the mood. It doesn't get all action hero cheesy on you. Instead, it comes in during meaningful sequences and sort of stays out of your way. One scene where you're swimming through a flooded section of the base triggers a quiet, mostly piano piece that fits incredibly well. There's also a little musical sting that lets you know when you've cleared a room of enemy soldiers, which is handy in cases where you can't see the entire room on-screen at once.<br/> <br/>Shadow Complex is an incredibly well-made game that finally grabs the \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\" href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" slug=\"metroidvania\"> Metroidvania</a>\" subgenre and drags it into the modern era instead of relegating it to a land of remakes or portable games. Players that obsess over speed runs and 100 percent completion will certainly find a lot of replayability, but even players who just want to play a game start to finish and move on will find that the quality of Shadow Complex makes it well worth its $15 price tag. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "Shadow Complex is amazing from start to finish... and after you finish it, you'll probably feel like diving right back in for another run.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-192/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26706/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/shadow-complex/3030-26706/", "id": 26706, "name": "Shadow Complex"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-08-17 06:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84325/", "id": 84325, "name": "Shadow Complex"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wolfenstein-review/1900-193/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1043501-wolfenstein03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043501\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"3840\" style=\"width: 3840px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1043501-wolfenstein03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043501\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1043501-wolfenstein03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This guy can shield other nearby enemies, so shoot him first.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>With a simple name like \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-21119\" href=\"/wolfenstein/3030-21119/\" slug=\"wolfenstein\"> Wolfenstein</a>,\" you might think that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1841\" href=\"/raven-software/3010-1841/\" slug=\"raven-software\"> Raven</a>'s latest is a full-on reboot of the series that popularized first-person shooting in the first place.

As it turns out, they've uncovered artifacts that allow them to harness the power of an alternate dimension called Black Sun. What's more, there's a sort of phased state that exists between the two dimensions known as the Veil. You quickly find a medallion that gives you the ability to enter the Veil, which changes the color of everything and increases your speed, giving you the drop on the Nazis. You'll also eventually earn powers that harness this dark energy, like the ability to slow time, a shield, and an \"empower\" ability that makes your shots do more damage and cut through enemy protection. It's the use of the Veil powers that makes Wolfenstein more than just another World War II shooter, and you'll use all of your powers both to solve simple puzzles and to make combat easier.<br/><br/>Of course, you'll have plenty of guns to use, too. The game starts you out with an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-265\" href=\"/mp40/3055-265/\" slug=\"mp40\"> MP40</a>, and you'll quickly get a single-shot rifle, the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-960\" href=\"/kar-98/3055-960/\" slug=\"kar-98\"> Kar 98</a>, and a better submachine gun, the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1442\" href=\"/stg-44/3055-1442/\" slug=\"stg-44\"> MP43</a>. Everything you get after that is a little more out-of-the-ordinary. That includes basic real-world weapons, like a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-45\" href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" slug=\"flamethrower\"> flamethrower</a> and a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\"> rocket launcher</a>, but you'll also start finding things like the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9322\" href=\"/nikola-tesla/3005-9322/\" slug=\"nikola-tesla\"> Tesla</a> Gun, which shoots electric bolts, or the particle cannon, which shoots a stream of energy that disintegrates most of your targets. There are eight weapons in all. Wolfenstein also has an upgrade system that lets you put any money you find into improving your weapons and your Veil abilities.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7047/436297-w6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-436297\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7047/436297-w6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-436297\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7047/436297-w6.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll have to shoot out this guy's shoulder packs to take him down.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The game itself has you hunting down the Nazis in charge of the Isenstadt operation while performing missions for a couple of different factions. You'll get your missions in a sort of overworld-type area that lets you roam around freely. You can choose to head over to the black market to purchase some new upgrades, head directly to the safehouse for one of the factions to advance the story, or just sort of wander the streets and search the buildings for additional gold or collectibles. It's cool that Wolfenstein has some kind of open-world component to it, but there isn't that much to do there. So it's really there to just connect the missions together in a meaningful way. When you open up a mission, a section of the city becomes available or a door unlocks that lets you get to the mission in question. Once you hit that door and load up the mission, the game resembles other first-person shooters in that the missions are decidedly linear and scripted. Still, it's a neat little trick. The campaign is pretty good, overall, with good map design and plenty of spots to flex your Veil powers and mow down the opposition.<br/><br/>Wolfenstein has an achievement for finishing the game in under 12 hours, but don't let that fool you. I ended up completing the game in around half that time without skipping any of the optional missions. It's not a particularly hard game, but that's because you're mostly just fighting regular Nazi soldiers, who all carry (and drop) the submachine guns in the game. So ammo for those weapons is extremely plentiful, while ammo for the more exotic devices is in short supply. While you can buy ammo at the black market, you're going to want to use that cash for upgrades, because there doesn't even seem to be enough money in the game to buy all of the upgrades. So the end result is that I went through the entire game relying on either the MP40 or the MP43, only switching to anything bigger during the game's very occasional boss encounters... which are telegraphed by the developers placing rooms full of every piece of ammo you could ever need immediately before you start a big fight.<br/><br/>The single-player campaign is accompanied by a team-based multiplayer component that lets players choose from three different classes. The soldier is your basic fighter; he gets the widest weapon selection and can throw satchel charges. The medic can drop health packs and the engineer can drop ammo and construct or repair turrets, which are features on some maps. Each class also gets a Veil ability, but that has to be unlocked first. For doing just about anything useful in a multiplayer match--even shooting an enemy a few times--you'll earn cash. That cash is spent on upgrades to your abilities and weapons. The system is similar to the perk setup in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2133\" href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare\"> Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare</a> in that even though you can unlock all of the abilities, you'll still have to choose a limited number to actually use in battle.<br/><br/>You'll be able to play three different modes on eight different maps. Team Deathmatch is, you know, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\"> team deathmatch</a>. Objective and Stopwatch are assault-style modes where one team defends a set of objectives while the attacking team constructs bridges, loads tank shells, or does whatever the map requires to get at and retrieve a specific item. They're as standard as they sound, but the quality of the maps themselves is pretty high.<br/><br/>It doesn't always look fantastic, which occasionally reminds you that this is a heavily modified version of the same technology that powered <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14537\" href=\"/doom-3/3030-14537/\" slug=\"doom-3\"> Doom 3</a>. But the gameplay both online and off is solid enough to make Wolfenstein worth checking out if you're a shooter fan on the hunt for something new. It's familiar enough in spots, but the way the Veil powers function gives everything just enough of a tweak to feel exciting.", "deck": "It's not going to blow your mind with new, never-before-seen features or anything like that, but Wolfenstein is well-designed and engaging from start to finish.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-193/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21119/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wolfenstein/3030-21119/", "id": 21119, "name": "Wolfenstein"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-08-18 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73882/", "id": 73882, "name": "Wolfenstein"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/professor-layton-and-the-diabolical-box-review/1900-194/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044251-ntr_proflayton2_06bg4_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044251\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56206088992974\" data-width=\"854\" style=\"width: 854px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044251-ntr_proflayton2_06bg4_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044251\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2788/1044251-ntr_proflayton2_06bg4_e3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hey!

And since I was so consistently entertained by the original's winning mix of head-scratching mystery, old-world charm, and dozens of brainteasers, I was perfectly happy to get more of the same here.<br/> <br/> The new game finds Layton and Luke on the trail of the Elysian Box, the antique referenced in the title that's said to instantly kill anyone who opens it. After the professor's old mentor falls victim to the box--or some other kind of foul play--the pair sets off on a luxury train line called the Molentary Express on a cross-country pursuit of both the item and some real answers. By contrast, the Curious Village was set entirely in the odd, eponymous hamlet of St. Mystere, and you as the player spent so much time confined there, covering the same ground and plumbing the town's mysteries that I felt like the Curious Village itself almost became a character or active participant in the story. Consequently, the story in this sequel initially felt a little disjointed to me, since you spend a comparatively short time in each location as you ride the train and explore the places where it stops.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>But the Molentary Express is just the beginning here, and it's not long before the story takes a turn for the surreal (and slightly macabre) and begins to take on an identity of its own, especially as the train deposits you in eerie, unexplained areas. Numerous references to the first game and some neat reappearances by its characters help ground this game's storyline in the familiar, too. And though I wasn't counting minutes or lines, I'd swear The Diabolical Box has a little more spoken dialogue and animated video sequences to flesh out its story than The Curious Village did.\u00a0<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044259-ntr_proflayton2_01ss03_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044259\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044259-ntr_proflayton2_01ss03_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044259\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2788/1044259-ntr_proflayton2_01ss03_e3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are some real head-scratchers (but this isn't one).</figcaption></figure>At any rate, if you played that first game, you'll find yourself immediately and thoroughly at home in The Diabolical Box, because the framework here is more or less identical. As before, the game has around 150 puzzles that you'll encounter by talking to the many colorful characters you meet (and by poking around the nicely rendered 2D environments). The best addition to the puzzles in the sequel is a \"memo\" feature that slides a transparent overlay across the entire puzzle and lets you annotate it to help you solve it. This comes in handy whenever you need to trace a pattern or do some quick sums, and generally alleviates that feeling of needing pencil and paper that may have vexed you from time to time (as it did me) in the first game.<br/> <br/> It's also worth noting that Diabolical Box attempts to tie more if its puzzles' subject matter directly into the storyline. So when the train gets stuck on the tracks, you get... a puzzle about rearranging train cars. Or when the identity of a missing child comes into question, you'll solve a sliding tile puzzle that reveals his true nature. It's a neat way to bridge the puzzle-solving gameplay with what's currently happening around you, so all the puzzles don't feel like total non sequiturs. On the other hand, while the game mostly does a good job of keeping the puzzles feeling fresh for veterans of the original game, you will notice a few puzzle styles returning on occasion, and a couple of puzzles were similar enough to ones I remember from the first time around that I felt like I knew how to solve them almost as soon as I saw them. For the most part, though, doing the puzzles here is just as satisfying as it was before.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044258-ntr_proflayton2_01ss02_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044258\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044258-ntr_proflayton2_01ss02_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044258\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2788/1044258-ntr_proflayton2_01ss02_e3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2788/1044258-ntr_proflayton2_01ss02_e3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll end up in some straaaange places.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>There are a few minigames available in the professor's suitcase, but some of them are a bit more involved this time around. One of them tasks you with working a fat hamster back into shape; you do this by collecting various items with different properties and laying them out on a grid to make the chubby little rodent run the pounds off. There's also a wholly setting-appropriate tea-making system where you collect different sorts of tea leaves and experiment with blending them into different kinds of teas, which can have some minor effects on Layton, Luke, and a few of the people you meet. There's a collection mechanic at work here that may give you something else to focus on besides pursuing your next lead, though I never felt myself completely distracted by the minigames from the task at hand.<br/> <br/> The real success of the Professor Layton series is the way its puzzle-solving and crime-solving aspects support and blend with one another. Alone, the two halves would respectively make for a decent minigame collection and dialogue-driven adventure game. But together they create a wonderful mixture of narrative intrigue and head-scratching puzzle gameplay that propels itself forward straight through to the end of the story. Every time you hit a slow period in your investigation, you'll be excited to have some new puzzles to solve--and every time you're feeling the mental fatigue of puzzling your way through them, you'll be glad to reveal another piece of the mystery. That mix is in full effect in DIabolical Box, and while the charm and satisfaction of playing Layton may be a little less of a surprise the second time around, it's still plenty worth coming back for.", "deck": "Dr. Layton's second case leans heavily on the first game's formula, which means it's just as full of charming mystery and head-scratching puzzles.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-194/", "platforms": "Nintendo DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22322/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/professor-layton-and-the-diabolical-box/3030-22322/", "id": 22322, "name": "Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-08-25 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84584/", "id": 84584, "name": "Professor Layton and the Diabolical Box"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/batman-arkham-asylum-review/1900-195/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1121149-highres_screenshot_00086_resize.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1121149\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1121149-highres_screenshot_00086_resize.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1121149\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1121149-highres_screenshot_00086_resize.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Batman's suit gets ripped up as you progress through the game.\u00a0</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-asylum\"> Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> is not messing around. This isn't some throwaway licensed product where you punch dudes and drive cars, occasionally stopping to throw a batarang just to be \"true\" to the license. This is a full-on experience devoted to all of the different facets of being <a data-ref-id=\"3005-66\" href=\"/batman/3005-66/\" slug=\"batman\"> Batman</a>, from the gadgets that help him along, to striking fear in the hearts of his opponents by carefully lurking in the shadows, to taking challenges head-on with little more than his feet and his fists, to straight-up acting like a detective, hunting around for clues. This all translates into an adventure full of variety, with each different aspect coming in at such a high level of quality that it just keeps impressing you over and over again, right up to its final moments.<br/> <br/> The game opens with Batman returning <a data-ref-id=\"3005-952\" href=\"/the-joker/3005-952/\" slug=\"the-joker\"> Joker</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1236\" href=\"/arkham-asylum/3035-1236/\" slug=\"arkham-asylum\"> Arkham Asylum</a>, the mental institution that houses all of the super criminals of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-111\" href=\"/gotham-city/3035-111/\" slug=\"gotham-city\"> Gotham City</a>. But Joker's admission hardly goes smoothly, and before too long, he's running the asylum, complete with a master plan involving a drug called Titan that turns men into gigantic, jacked-up murder junkies. Along the way, you'll encounter plenty of regular thugs, as well as a swath of lesser Batman villains, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2979\" href=\"/harley-quinn/3005-2979/\" slug=\"harley-quinn\"> Harley Quinn</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6337\" href=\"/killer-croc/3005-6337/\" slug=\"killer-croc\"> Killer Croc</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4907\" href=\"/scarecrow/3005-4907/\" slug=\"scarecrow\"> Scarecrow</a>, who brings with him some <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7512\" href=\"/eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem/3030-7512/\" slug=\"eternal-darkness-sanitys-requiem\"> Eternal Darkness</a>-like sanity effects that turn into full-on hallucination sequences. The characters are treated well, which makes each encounter with a main villain feel memorable, even if most of them aren't traditional boss fights.<br/> <br/> In a lot of ways, the gameplay in Arkham Asylum feels similar to the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-3\" href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\" slug=\"metroid\"> Metroid</a>/<a data-ref-id=\"3025-86\" href=\"/castlevania/3025-86/\" slug=\"castlevania\"> Castlevania</a> style of exploration-focused adventure. In the early parts of the game, you'll immediately start seeing areas you can't reach or walls that you can't get through. You'll return to these areas later on, once you've acquired the proper gear. Though the game is very linear in the way it presents its objectives, the island feels wide-open, and in most cases, you're free to roam around as you please. The game contains plenty of collectible objects to reward explorers, and you'll also have challenges to solve. These are especially cool because they come your way in the form of clues from <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2948\" href=\"/the-riddler/3005-2948/\" slug=\"the-riddler\"> The Riddler</a> that give you a sentence or two about the thing you're looking for and what area of the world you can expect to find it in. The riddle approach, along with some in-game maps that help point you at trophies and other items, prevents the collectibles from getting too tedious over the course of the game.<br/> <br/> The cool part about playing Arkham Asylum is that you're never doing any one thing for too long. As you move from one area to the next, you'll transition between up-close fights with multiple thugs, stealth areas where you'll want to carefully take down enemies from behind, and plenty of enemy-free rooms where you just need to figure out how to navigate the area. The fighting feels nice and has a combo system that lets you easily transition from one target to the next. You'll face off against these guys in groups, forcing you to watch your back. When an enemy attempts to hit you, a little marker will appear above his head, giving you time to hit a counter button to prevent the attack. You'll also unlock extra moves as you gain experience and upgrade your abilities. It's rarely difficult, but Batman animates well enough to make the combat really satisfying.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113582-t_batmanaa_vp_hd_30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113582\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113582-t_batmanaa_vp_hd_30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113582\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113582-t_batmanaa_vp_hd_30.jpg\"></a><figcaption>As you collect items around the island, you'll open up bios and other bonuses.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The stealth aspects of Arkham Asylum are often optional, but as Batman is not some kind of super-powered, invincible guy, guns are baaaad news. You won't die from one shot, but any sort of prolonged exposure to armed enemies results in a quick death. So there are plenty of spots where you'll do well to stay out of sight. Batman: Arkham Asylum makes the stealth side of things more about flexing your considerable abilities to toy with your foes instead of locking you down into some kind of rote pattern-memorization exercise. When you aren't holding down the run button, Batman is effectively silent, letting you drop in behind enemies with ease. Many of the stealth areas have gargoyles around the edges of the room that you can grapple up to hang (and hide) on. If spotted, you can usually just grapple up to a gargoyle, grapple to a different one, and so on until they lose you. But the enemies don't just \"reset\" back into set patterns. They slowly start freaking out and get more and more tense as you eliminate their posse one man at a time. Also, later on in the game, the enemies start wearing collars that make noise when their wearer is incapacitated, drawing all attention to that part of the room. This makes things a little trickier.<br/> <br/> Then, of course, there's the exploration itself. At any time you can flip into \"detective mode,\" which is an alternate viewing mode that lets you see scent trails, DNA, or other things you might be using to track your current target. This mode also lets you see through walls, letting you get a good sense of what's coming up, where enemies are positioned, and so on. It also highlights things like ventilation ducts and other points of interest that might blend into the background if you aren't careful.<br/> <br/> All of the different aspects of Batman: Arkham Asylum come together along with some great graphics. The principal characters look really great and extremely thick. The meaty character models make the fighting look downright painful. The island itself also looks great, with a great amount of variety, with torn-up cell blocks, a mansion, a big greenhouse, and a sizable exterior with guard towers, statues, and so on. The atmospheric nature of the game is also furthered by its audio. There's a lot of great voice work throughout the game, and there's a lot of it to listen to, including collectible tapes you'll find that feature some of the game's criminals being interviewed by Arkham's psychiatrists, giving you a bit of insight into the characters. Also, the combat itself is bolstered by some great smacks, chops, and thumps.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113574-t_batmanaa_vp_hd_22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113574\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113574-t_batmanaa_vp_hd_22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113574\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113574-t_batmanaa_vp_hd_22.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113574-t_batmanaa_vp_hd_22.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Detective mode lets you detect... stuff.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The game will probably take most players somewhere around 12 hours to complete, depending on how ruthless you are about grabbing collectibles. You'll unlock challenge levels along the way, too, giving you the ability to focus on the combat or replay some of the stealth rooms from the adventure, but when removed from the context of the main game, I found the challenge rooms to be a little flat. Also, it's worth noting that the game isn't very difficult on its normal setting. The game's few fights against life-barred bosses use simple patterns, and the standard combat isn't likely to cause much trouble, either. The game has a hard setting, but it removes things like the indicator for when you need to counter during a fight... which sort of just makes combat frustrating.

There are some notable new features and plenty of rocking to be had in GH5, but this is definitely a game more concerned with giving you what you expect from Guitar Hero than pushing any boundaries.<br/><br/>     As the name implies, the Guitar Hero series has always put a premium on big, stadium-rattling rock songs, and despite the presence of drums and vocals, it seems like it's the fretted instruments that hold the most sway. You get 85 songs on the disc with Guitar Hero 5, and there are plenty of hard-rocking numbers in there from bands like Bon Jovi, Iron Maiden, Megadeth, The Rolling Stones, Smashing Pumpkins, and The White Stripes, among others. There's old stuff and there's new stuff, and a respectable portion of it is quite fun to play, but there are a number of songs that don't really agree with the game's rock-star attitude, like songs from Coldplay and Vampire Weekend, and some that just feel like filler. There just doesn't seem to be any real central vision to the song list. With all the licensing and audience considerations, I don't envy the task of trying to cook up a rhythm game song list that can be all things to all people. Still, Guitar Hero 5's approach to pleasing everyone meant that I found a handful of tracks that I really enjoyed playing, and a lot of material that I had little desire to revisit. <br/><br/>Comparatively, the series' glammy caricatured rock-n-roll fantasy aesthetic is intact and looking better than ever in Guitar Hero 5. The visuals in World Tour suffered from a certain mechanical blandness that seemed like a byproduct of the introduction of a character creator. While there are definitely some mannequin moments in GH5, everything is brimming with detail and color and movement. The shaky camera, the excess of colored light and smoke and pyro effects, and the increasingly ridiculous venues--which include an abandoned subway station, a boson reactor, and a barge beneath the Golden Gate Bridge--give the performances a terrific visceral punch. A lot of the character animation seems song-specific, which goes a long way to connecting the characters on your screen to the song that's being played. It even works pretty well when you're playing as your console avatar in the Xbox 360 version of the game.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1119986-guitar_hero_5_xbox_360_048.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1119986\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1119986-guitar_hero_5_xbox_360_048.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1119986\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/45471/1119986-guitar_hero_5_xbox_360_048.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Who would've pegged Cobain as a big Blink-182 fan?</figcaption></figure>  This comes back to bite GH5 a little bit, specifically with the inclusion of a handful of real-life rockers as playable characters. Once you've unlocked Carlos Santana, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12127\" href=\"/shirley-manson/3005-12127/\" slug=\"shirley-manson\">     Shirley Manson</a> from Garbage, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12123\" href=\"/kurt-cobain/3005-12123/\" slug=\"kurt-cobain\">    Kurt Cobain</a>, or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11880\" href=\"/johnny-cash/3005-11880/\" slug=\"johnny-cash\">   Johnny Cash</a>, they're then available as playable characters for any other song in the game. It's kind of silly and absurd to see Santana or Manson playing other instruments on songs other than their own, but there's something disconcerting about seeing a semi-realistic-looking Cash or Cobain up there, rocking out and smiling it up and just trying to put on a real good lively show for the people like any other fabricated character you might randomly assemble. I think it's partially because they're both dead, so they can't give their consent for such use of their likenesses, but also because both were basically defined as outsiders, the kinds of guys who might not take kindly to basically being used as puppets. I don't think this is the venue for a dissertation on the topic, but suffice it to say that I found some of that stuff a little off-putting. I will admit, though, that there's something resonant about seeing Johnny Cash snarl his way through Rammstein's \"Du Hast.\"<br/><br/>     The modes in Guitar Hero 5 are fairly predictable, though each has been tweaked in some meaningful ways. The career mode is still basically just a long list of songs that you chew your way through, though each song now has an instrument-specific challenge associated with it that can earn you new character costumes and other bonuses. These can be simple score challenges, or they can be far more specific, such as using an upstroke to hit a number of notes when playing bass. It would be nice if there were more variety to the challenges, but it's a clever way to test your skills and to get players to try instruments outside of their comfort zone.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1106315-8940_01_0042_20090629_4g4h1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1106315\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1106315-8940_01_0042_20090629_4g4h1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1106315\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1106315-8940_01_0042_20090629_4g4h1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1106315-8940_01_0042_20090629_4g4h1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Challenges add another layer to the action. </figcaption></figure> In what I've interpreted as a tacit acknowledgement that the proliferation of rhythm games has left many a living room with more plastic instruments than it really needs, quick play now lets you play with up to four of any instrument you've got, which is also terribly handy when either no one or everyone wants to play a particular instrument. More than any of the past few games in the series, Guitar Hero 5 seems to recognize that not everyone is looking to get 100% on Dragonforce songs on expert; some folks are just looking for a little rock-n-roll and some casual fun. This culminates in the party play mode, which takes any competitive edge off the experience, letting players jump in and out or change difficulty or instruments all on the fly. If it's competition you want, though, there are a number of modes you can play both online and off, my favorite of which is momentum, which is basically a score challenge where the difficulty level you're playing at will adjust dynamically based on how well you're doing. Guitar Hero 5 features an updated version of the GH Studio toolset, which allows you to create your own songs, share them online, and download other players' creations, though the resulting songs still sound too much like the stiff MIDI songs that they are to make this feature terribly compelling.<br/>\u00a0<br/>There's something about the return to a standard numbering scheme for Guitar Hero 5 that suggests to me that this is, more than anything else, a commodity, a manufactured product, albeit a very attractive and energetic one. Neversoft seems more comfortable and confident than ever with this series it has inherited, but there doesn't seem to be a lot of passion behind the craft.\u00a0", "deck": "Neversoft delivers a bubbly, slick-looking Guitar Hero game that benefits from big production values and a more accessible feel, and suffers from some questionable choices and a track list that lacks cohesion.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-196/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24711/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/guitar-hero-5/3030-24711/", "id": 24711, "name": "Guitar Hero 5"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-09-04 07:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84272/", "id": 84272, "name": "Guitar Hero 5"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-beatles-rock-band-review/1900-197/", "description": "<a data-ref-id=\"3030-24667\" href=\"/the-beatles-rock-band/3030-24667/\" slug=\"the-beatles-rock-band\"> </a><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1107406-menu_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1107406\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4000\" style=\"width: 4000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1107406-menu_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1107406\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1107406-menu_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Every last inch of the game, from the menus on down, radiates with style.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24667\" href=\"/the-beatles-rock-band/3030-24667/\" slug=\"the-beatles-rock-band\">             The Beatles: Rock Band</a> is not the first band-specific music game of its type, but it might as well be the last. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-648\" href=\"/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/\" slug=\"harmonix-music-systems-inc\">            Harmonix</a> and Apple Corps have come together (sorry) to create a package that pays carefully enthusiastic tribute to the musical legacy of those four lads from Liverpool, and I'm not sure you could ask for more from a game that focuses on the Beatles--or, really, any band. Sure, if you measure this by the cold metrics of gameplay features and the length of the song list, The Beatles: Rock Band comes up quite short against <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24711\" href=\"/guitar-hero-5/3030-24711/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-5\">           Guitar Hero 5</a> or even <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20714\" href=\"/rock-band-2/3030-20714/\" slug=\"rock-band-2\">          Rock Band 2</a>. The gameplay itself is, generally speaking, much easier than what genre fans might have come to expect by now. And if you're expecting all the sordid details on the band's slow and tense disintegration, you're better off watching  <i>Let It Be</i>, because this is definitely the glossy fan-club version of how things went down. Even with those restraints in place,  The Beatles: Rock Band is a fun and occasionally magical experience, whether you're a Beatles fan or not.<br/><br/>There are, essentially, two modes of play in The Beatles: Rock Band. There's a quick play mode, which lets you jump into any song you'd like to, online or off, with one to six players. <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">         Rock Band</a> is usually a four-piece setup, and those two extra players come from the two additional mics you can plug in for the two- and three-part harmonies found in a number of the Beatles' songs. It's the one big gameplay addition the game makes to the Rock Band formula, and it makes a lot of sense for The Beatles. It's also more demanding of actual musical skill than anything I've ever seen from one of these games, and it certainly requires more tonality than I can personally muster. As with the other instruments, there's a tutorial for the harmonies that tries to explain things plainly enough, though I felt like my grasp of it was still tenuous once the tutorial ended. If you're really determined to master the vocal harmonies, though, it's easy enough to jump into practice mode or just turn on the no-fail option when you're playing normally. <br/><br/>Quick play is where you'll go when you and your drunk friends just want to annoy the neighbors with \u201cYellow Submarine,\u201d but the story mode is the heart of The Beatles: Rock Band. This is a loosely biographical mode that moves you through the music of the Beatles in chronological order, with the venue and the look of the Beatles themselves changing at regular intervals. The way the game lays out the history of the Beatles' career is perhaps the most impactful aspect of the story mode, highlighting just how much the band's music evolved over a relatively brief seven-year period. You'll start off performing songs like \u201cTwist and Shout\u201d and \u201cI Saw Her Standing There\u201d at The Cavern Club, a converted air-raid shelter in Liverpool that The Beatles played at regularly. From there it's \u201cCan't Buy Me Love\u201d and \u201cA Hard Day's Night\u201d on the Ed Sullivan Show, followed by more middle-period Beatles material performed at <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1476\" href=\"/shea-stadium/3035-1476/\" slug=\"shea-stadium\">        Shea Stadium</a> and Budokan, all incredibly iconic live performances for the band.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1107414-withinwithoutyou_nohud_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1107414\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4000\" style=\"width: 4000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1107414-withinwithoutyou_nohud_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1107414\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1107414-withinwithoutyou_nohud_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Nope, nobody here singing about the effects of LSD! Move along now!</figcaption></figure>  Reflecting the Beatles' decision to stop performing live, the game shifts the venue to Abbey Road for several stages. The game takes some terrific creative liberties during these stages, relying on often-psychedelic \u201cdreamscape\u201d visuals to keep things interesting. For some songs, the dreamscape concept works brilliantly. \u201cYellow Submarine\u201d is the first one you'll see in story mode, and the way it gradually shifts from the studio to a trippy underwater playground--complete with that titular submergible and the Beatles donning their colorful costumes from the animated movie of the same name--is perhaps one of the most striking examples. Similarly, songs from  <i>Sgt. Pepper</i> and  <i>Magical Mystery Tour</i> often find the band donning the iconic costumes associated with those albums. There are definitely songs from the Beatles' studio era that don't lend themselves as well to such explicit imagery, but even when it's just colored lights and acid-laced filters, the dreamscapes bring a lot of playfulness to the game. The character models bring a lot of life to the game as well, opting for the mildly caricatured look of regular Rock Band characters over anything approaching photo-realism, though they also look a bit more detailed and less dead in the eyes than regular Rock Band characters.<br/><br/>It all wraps up with the live show atop the Apple Corps building, the last time the four would ever perform together live. Again, an incredibly iconic performance, though it's the one where the reductive powers of music games felt a little uncomfortable for me. In reality, the band was barely on speaking terms at this point, but in the game it's little more than a backdrop for more songs. Expecting the game to try and convey the discord within the group and the bittersweet moment of old friends with complicated relationships playing one last show together is admittedly pretty demanding, but it speaks to the emotional investment that the Beatles can evoke from a listener.<br/><br/>With a grand total of 45 songs on the disc, this is by no means the definitive collection of the Beatles' music. There are a few songs on the disc that aren't \u201cessential\u201d by any means--the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9405\" href=\"/ringo-starr/3005-9405/\" slug=\"ringo-starr\">       Ringo</a>-sung cover of The Shirelles' \u201cBoys\u201d and the \"Tomorrow Never Knows\"/\"Within You Without You\" mash-up from the Beatles-themed Cirque du Soleil show  <i>Love</i> stick out to me the most--and several of my favorite Beatles songs aren't in the game at all. On the other hand, there are several songs in the game that I now consider some of my favorites after playing The Beatles: Rock Band, and it's a nicely rounded sampler that seems to go out of its way to give each member of the band his dues. Additionally, Harmonix has been pretty committed to releasing downloadable content for its Rock Band games, and The Beatles: Rock Band comes with \u201cAll You Need is Love\u201d available as Xbox 360-exclusive DLC on day one, with promises of  <i>Abbey Road</i>,  <i>Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band</i>, and  <i>Rubber Soul</i> DLC in the near future. Of course, there's a finite amount of Beatles material to be mined for DLC, and unlike all that other Rock Band DLC, and music released for The Beatles: Rock Band won't be compatible with any other currently available iterations of Rock Band. <br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1107411-reward_01_02_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1107411\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4000\" style=\"width: 4000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1107411-reward_01_02_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1107411\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1107411-reward_01_02_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1107411-reward_01_02_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0It's probably not much that hardcore Beatles fans haven't seen, but the bonus content is still engaging.</figcaption></figure>  This is a decision indicative of the control that Apple Corps held over the development of The Beatles: Rock Band, and it seems to inform other choices, such as the fact that using the whammy bar to goose more \u201cBeatlemania\u201d (otherwise known as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-785\" href=\"/overdrive/3015-785/\" slug=\"overdrive\">      overdrive</a> in a regular Rock Band game) doesn't actually affect the sound of the notes. It also potentially influenced the fact that The Beatles: Rock Band isn't as hard as other contemporary music games. Everything up to the hard difficulty feels toned down, though there's a significant jump in difficulty when you hit expert.\u00a0 Some of the difficulty, though, seems inherent to the music. The Beatles didn't make especially complicated music, so it goes to reason that a game based on that music wouldn't be too complicated, either. <br/>\u00a0<br/>The Beatles: Rock Band is absolutely brimming with details and bonus content that are sure to please fans. Success in the story mode, for example, is rewarded with behind-the-scenes photos of the band, and accruing enough photos will unlock a series of interesting videos of the band as well. One of my absolute favorite touches in The Beatles: Rock Band is how, during the Abbey Road years, you'll hear studio noise as a song loads. It's not much more than idle chatter, analog equipment hum, and the occasional practice riff, but it's stuff that's all been pulled from the master tapes at Abbey Road, and it goes a long way towards establishing a sense of authenticity.<br/><br/>The Beatles: Rock Band sets a new standard for how band-focused music games should be executed, one that will be very difficult to match. Beyond all the stylistic flairs and the fan-service touches, this is just an incredibly fun, incredibly accessible bunch of music, with very little filler in its track listing. This isn't a music appreciation class, and I'm not at all qualified as a music critic, but I feel very comfortable saying that the Beatles is one of the most \u201cimportant\u201d musical acts of the past, let's say, 60 years. This significance warrants the time and detail that has gone into The Beatles: Rock Band, and I'm not sure that there's another band out there that deserves the same treatment. This is a first big step into the digital age for The Beatles, but it might also mark the end for band-specific music games.", "deck": "A loving tribute to one of the most influential pop groups of the 20th century with an abundance of catchy, recognizable songs to make up for the gameplay's relative simplicity.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-197/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24667/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-beatles-rock-band/3030-24667/", "id": 24667, "name": "The Beatles: Rock Band"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-09-09 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83599/", "id": 83599, "name": "The Beatles: Rock Band (Limited Edition Premium Bundle)"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/section-8-review/1900-198/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1111589-t_section8_e309_fragfest_gp_hd_54.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1111589\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1111589-t_section8_e309_fragfest_gp_hd_54.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1111589\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1111589-t_section8_e309_fragfest_gp_hd_54.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll drop from the sky onto the map every time you spawn. It's pretty cool.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Section 8 is a sci-fi-themed first-person shooter in which men in shielded power armor do battle with a variety of weapons. On paper, a list of Section 8's features and concepts make it sound pretty cool. In practice, however, this large-scale, multiplayer-focused release doesn't get the feel of its weapons down, resulting in action that often feels disconnected and flat. When taken with its poor attempt at crafting a single-player campaign, you're left with a well-meaning game that fails to engage players.<br/> <br/> In Section 8, the combatants wear large, armored suits and are launched into battle from the sky. Every time you spawn, you spawn ten seconds above ground, screaming down to the planet's surface at breakneck speeds. Also, you can choose to spawn just about anywhere on the map in multiplayer matches... but choosing to drop in an area covered by the enemy's anti-aircraft guns is akin to suicide. Once you're on the ground, the game is decidedly <a data-ref-id=\"3025-51\" href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" slug=\"battlefield\">Battlefield</a>-like. The maps grow and shrink to fit different player counts (up to 32 players can get together, even on the 360, provided you're connected to a dedicated server) and the action is all about raising your team's score by taking hold of control points while preventing the opposing team from doing the same. You'll do this by gunning them down with a handful of different futuristic-looking, but very standard weapons, such as an assault rifle, a heavy machine gun, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">rocket launcher</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">sniper rifle</a>, grenades, and so on. The game lets you configure your loadouts to adhere to a handful of preset classes, but you can also build your own custom loadouts to choose which weapons you want to fight with. You can also change loadouts on the battlefield at supply depots, some of which come with holding certain control points. But you can also deploy them yourself.<br/> <br/> An interesting twist to Section 8's gameplay is that you can earn money that can be spent on deployable gear. Like yourself, it's also dropped in from the sky, so it's a good thing that all of the maps take place almost completely outside. You can drop anti-personnel turrets, anti-air guns, sensor arrays that show enemy movement on your team's map, vehicles, and so on. While it's not something that totally makes or breaks the game, the concept of deployable gear is pretty neat.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1111556-t_section8_e309_fragfest_gp_hd_23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1111556\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1111556-t_section8_e309_fragfest_gp_hd_23.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1111556\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1111556-t_section8_e309_fragfest_gp_hd_23.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The weapons look futuristic, but behave in a very standard way.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>On top of the control points, Section 8 will also give you side missions to complete during a battle, such as delivering a bomb to a specific location, protecting an AI-based VIP character as he makes his way from one control point to another, driving a convoy across the map, and so on. It's tactically interesting when these come up, because you have to decide if you're going to go for these optional missions or stick with the control point gameplay. Earning points by completing specific feats on the battlefield lets you trigger these side missions. But the AI-controlled VIP moves slowly and rarely takes the safest path to his destination, making those annoying. All of the vehicle control in Section 8 is pretty bad, making convoy a bit of a bust, too.<br/> <br/> The big problem that puts a serious hurt on everything else in Section 8 is that weapons feel very limp. They look like big, scary, sci-fi guns, but don't feel like they're doing serious damage when they connect. The soldiers on the battlefield have shields and health meters, and when you're shooting a target, it feels like you're just staring at the meters and watching them drop instead of seeing any actual damage on the soldiers. The only real piece of visual feedback you get aside from the meters is a flash that indicates when a soldier's shields have dropped. But some weapons seem to cut through shields and do direct damage to a player's health, too. All of the meter-watching may be effective, but it also gets in the way and makes the game a bit less immersive.<br/> <br/> The multiplayer mode is the first item on the game's main menu, which gives you a good sense of what the developers' priorities must have been. Below that there's an \"instant action\" option that lets you play against bots, which isn't very exciting at all. Bots can also appear in online games. Under that is the game's campaign, a short set of missions that feels like it was cobbled together at the last minute. The campaign is a lot like the multiplayer, except it's a one-way fight as you stomp your way from one checkpoint to the next. When you die, you simply respawn at the last checkpoint and continue the fight where you left off. This means you can complete just about any objective by just throwing yourself at it again and again. It requires no skill to accomplish and doesn't teach you very much about the game, either, so it isn't an effective tutorial for multiplayer. The only time it seemed like there was something I could fail at with consequence was when I was asked to escort a convoy across a bridge. The rest of the game can be completed by running past most of your enemies and getting right to the control point or terminal or whatever the next objective is. It's a pretty lame excuse for a single-player component.<br/> <br/> Visually, the game's best feature is the size of its maps. Much like a Battlefield game, these areas can be quite large, though your power suit's high-speed running abilities make crossing a map pretty easy. The character models don't look so great and the in-game animation isn't terrific, either. The sound effects and voice work are fairly standard.<br/> <br/> There are some neat aspects of Section 8 and some good ideas that keep the game from getting too straightforward. But it feels like half of a game. The single-player campaign is a joke and this style of large-scale multiplayer has been done better elsewhere. Considering how competitive the multiplayer shooter genre is, that puts Section 8 in a pretty tough spot. But if you're looking for a different take on the Battlefield style, Section 8 does have its share of interesting moments.", "deck": "Section 8 has some cool ideas at its core, but the execution falls flat too often to be wholly recommendable.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-198/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20576/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/section-8/3030-20576/", "id": 20576, "name": "Section 8"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-09-11 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83835/", "id": 83835, "name": "Section 8"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/need-for-speed-shift-review/1900-199/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1078849-fd7l6q.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1078849\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"672\" style=\"width: 672px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1078849-fd7l6q.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1078849\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1078849-fd7l6q.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The car models in Shift look really nice.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>\"Shift\" is a pretty good name for the latest game in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-483\" href=\"/need-for-speed/3025-483/\" slug=\"need-for-speed\">  Need for Speed franchise</a>.

Instead of of fitting in with games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-76\" href=\"/burnout/3025-76/\" slug=\"burnout\">  Burnout</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-396\" href=\"/ridge-racer/3025-396/\" slug=\"ridge-racer\">  Ridge Racer</a>, Shift is an attempt to move into simulation territory, placing the game a little closer to games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-263\" href=\"/gran-turismo/3025-263/\" slug=\"gran-turismo\">  Gran Turismo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-199\" href=\"/forza-motorsport/3025-199/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport\">  Forza Motorsport</a>, or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-430\" href=\"/project-gotham-racing/3025-430/\" slug=\"project-gotham-racing\">  Project Gotham Racing</a>. PGR is probably the most direct point of comparison for Shift, as this latest NFS release attempts to straddle the line between authenticity and accessibility. While it pulls that aspect off fairly well, other parts of Need for Speed: Shift don't stack up. So you're left with a game that feels like it can't make up its mind about what it wants to be, and it doesn't do any one thing especially well.<br/> <br/> The first thing you'll do when you turn on Need for Speed: Shift is quickly race a short track. During this, the game gauges your performance and decides which level of difficulty and assistance you'll probably require to enjoy the game. After that race, it'll recommend an AI difficulty setting (easy, medium, or hard) and a handling model (casual, normal, experienced, or pro). From there, you can tweak the settings to your liking. The handling model setting governs the level of automated assistance you'll receive from the game. There are assists for steering and braking, as well as more real-world things like anti-lock brakes, traction control, and stability control. You can also decide if you want damage to impact your car's performance and, of course, you can switch to manual transmission. With everything turned on and set as casually as it gets, the game practically plays itself. The auto-brake slows you down for corners in a pretty conservative way, and all you really need to do is point the nose of your car at the game's dynamic driving line to stay on course. With everything turned off, obviously, the game gets more serious, but even when it's set as seriously as it can get, NFS doesn't quite feel like it matches up too favorably with the heavyweights of the console racing simulation world.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1078841-2hgh7vt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1078841\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1078841-2hgh7vt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1078841\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1078841-2hgh7vt.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The cockpits look great, but the bumper cam gives you a better view of the action.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>A big part of that is due to the way the game's rewards are structured. Early on, the game makes a big deal about your driving style and presents it as precision versus aggression. On the track, this means that certain things you do will earn you precision points, while others earn aggression. Both of these end up fueling your driving level, which gives you additional cash and other bonuses as you level up. But the differences are minor. If you bump a guy while you're passing him, you get points for a \"dirty overtake.\" If you don't bump him, you get points for a \"clean overtake.\" The real issue is that even if you stomp around the track with no regard for your opponents and pass with as much brute force as possible, it becomes incredibly difficult to earn aggression points once you're at the front of the pack. But precision points are easier to stack, since you get those for things like sticking to the driving line and taking corners skillfully. Even in races where I spun out most of the competition on my way to the front of the pack, I'd usually end up with two or three times as many precision points by the end of a race. Plus, by rewarding players for colliding with other cars, the game doesn't really encourage you to drive with much skill.<br/> <br/> There are also a few cases where the physics just feel off. Take, for example, my fully upgraded Nissan GT-R. For the last segment of the game, you'll be able to race in cars like this one, and with the way I can drive it, it feels like I've smuggled a very fast forklift onto the track. Whenever I rear end another vehicle in the upgraded GT-R, it pops up into the air, letting me drive right underneath it. Obviously, this has a more negative impact when damage is enabled, but it's completely ridiculous and makes the last tier of races easier than they probably should be.<br/> <br/> The game is structured into tiers that are filled with different events, like standard races, lap time challenges, drift events, and so on. Each event lets you earn stars based on your performance, and you need more stars to unlock the higher tiers. Each of the four tiers has its own set of cars, though you can buy upgrades to keep lower-tiered cars competitive in the later races. Once you've earned 280 stars, you can take on the final set of races, the NFS Live World Tour. There isn't much to tie the different races together. Unlike previous NFS games, there's no storyline here to keep things moving, and the closest thing you get to a \"character\" is the British guy who comes over an in-car radio to tell you that a race is about to start before half-heartedly shouting \"have fun\" as you drive off. The constant reminders to have fun just made me realize that, no, I wasn't really having much fun as I moved from one race track to the next.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/891301-nfsshift6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-891301\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/891301-nfsshift6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-891301\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2788/891301-nfsshift6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2788/891301-nfsshift6.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You'll unlock more vinyls and paint options as you level up.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>So what's missing from Need for Speed: Shift that holds it back? That's a tougher question to answer. On paper, it sounds fine. The game has plenty of cars and tracks. The graphics are solid, with great-looking car models. It has a cool online driver duel mode that lets you work your way up a ladder to earn online racing championships. The car upgrades, though not named with actual part manufacturers, come in stages to let you keep working on a low-level car, if thats your desire. Or you can save up for a supercar. You can tune the cars with either an easy set of sliders or an advanced mode that lets you get in and adjust wing angles and so on. It even has a decent cockpit view, if you're into that sort of thing. But Shift is lacking in that it doesn't really inspire any reverence for the subject matter. The cars don't feel real, and the racing doesn't feel serious. The fetishization of cars and road racing that powers other console racing simulators doesn't exist in Shift's world. The game is perfectly competent, but a lot of it feels hollow.<br/> <br/> Looking at it from the other side doesn't paint a prettier picture. If you don't like simulator-styled racing games, and you happened to enjoy the last few Need for Speed games, there's no slider in Shift that makes it feel like those games. At best, you can make it an easy game, but gliding through all of the races without challenging yourself doesn't make the game any more enjoyable. The game feels like it's stuck between two worlds, and it doesn't execute well enough on either side to fully satisfy any type of racing fan. That said, if you're a fan of racing sims and you're looking for something to tide you over until the next big thing comes along, Shift certainly isn't a bad game.

The game has some neat tricks, but it doesn't have enough of them. So the stylish gimmicks that the game throws in here and there get old quickly, making the bulk of Wet awfully monotonous. That said, there's something about Wet that makes it a bit better than it seems.<br/> <br/> That something is the game's lead character, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4334\" href=\"/rubi-malone/3005-4334/\" slug=\"rubi-malone\">Rubi Malone</a>. In the Tarantino Lite world of Wet, Rubi is the game's Uma Thurman. But rather than going whole-hog and giving her a billion lines of dialogue about pop-culture minutia, she's usually portrayed as a tough chick of few words. And those words manage to have a good, vulgar impact. For example, after stealing a rare book and freefalling through the burning wreckage of an airplane that she essentially destroyed while fighting in midair for a loose parachute, she returns to her employer and simply mutters \"here's your fucking <i>book</i>.\" A lot of the dialogue is brief and curse-filled in a way that almost seems shocking in spots. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-76821\" href=\"/eliza-dushku/3040-76821/\" slug=\"eliza-dushku\">Eliza Dushku</a>, who voices Rubi, usually does a great job with the dialogue in those shorter bits. But in the few instances where Rubi rattles on for a bit longer, the spell is broken and the character starts to sound a little hokey. Then there are things like the noise Rubi makes when she dies, which sounds more like the grunt someone would make after discovering they got a parking ticket than the sound of someone getting murdered in some horrible way.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/851920-942900_20070820_screen006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-851920\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/851920-942900_20070820_screen006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-851920\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/851920-942900_20070820_screen006.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's also about jumping sideways in slow-motion.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The actual action in Wet is split between gunning down rooms full of dudes and some light platforming. The shooting is a little weird. While you can simply take aim and fire, you won't last very long playing that way. Instead, you have to jump around and perform acrobatic moves. When you take aim at an enemy while sliding on your knees, jumping, or running on a wall, the game automatically slows down. You become harder to hit and it becomes significantly easier to shoot or stab the bad guys. There's no limit to the slow-mo, so the game starts looking really silly as you hop back and forth and slide all over the place. Occasionally you'll end up in arenas, where enemies keep flooding into the room until you can get to a trigger near each door and cut it with your sword, closing the door.<br/> <br/> When you're not flipping out and killing people, you're doing a little wall-crawling. None of the time spent jumping from one ledge to another or shimmying sideways on ledges is especially difficult. It's occasionally tricky to figure out where to jump next, but the game is usually really good about automatically positioning the camera in a way that makes it really obvious. There are also a couple of sequences where you ride around on the tops of fast-moving cars, which combine basic aiming and shooting with some occasional <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">quick time events</a>. Some levels are also done in \"rage mode,\" which isn't really a mode at all. It's mostly just a visual change that makes the entire world red, makes blood white, and generally makes the game look a bit like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18347\" href=\"/killer7/3030-18347/\" slug=\"killer7\">Killer7</a>. Like most of the other things in Wet, it's cool the first time you see it, but not very cool at all the second time it pops up. The game also takes time out of the action to force you through some really boring challenge levels, where you have to run and jump through hoops as quickly as possible. They feel really out of place.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/851918-942900_20070820_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-851918\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4865/851918-942900_20070820_screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-851918\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/851918-942900_20070820_screen004.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4865/851918-942900_20070820_screen004.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It's also about... whatever it is that's happening here.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Graphically, Wet looks decent. Rubi is probably the high point, with a great-looking character model that manages to emote well in cutscenes. By default, the game runs with a thick layer of film grain over everything--the gameplay, the cutscenes, the menus, everything. The picture jumps a little bit, again, like an old movie. And the game occasionally just throws up an (unskippable) old '70s-era policy trailer from the drive-ins of yore, just in case you weren't getting the whole \"we're trying to make this look like an old exploitation movie\" thing driven into your skull hard enough. It's a bit much, and after playing Wet for an extended period of time, the way the picture constantly bounces and drifts around the screen started making me feel a little motion sick. You can disable the film grain, but at that point, the game looks flat, plain, and even a little ugly in spots.<br/> <br/> The story of double-crosses and revenge feels pretty inconsequential over the course of Wet, but it manages to get the game's sharp dialogue across, so it certainly has its place. But that's probably the best thing that can be said about Wet, because the rest of its interesting moments get driven into the ground through repetition over the course of its 12 chapters.

As much as it was designed to make comic-book geeks giddy, MUA was also a remarkably engaging and accessible action RPG with just enough role-playing trappings to keep the button-mashy gameplay interesting. <br/><br/><a data-ref-id=\"3010-519\" href=\"/vicarious-visions/3010-519/\" slug=\"vicarious-visions\"> </a><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22127/1079624-jj.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1079624\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22127/1079624-jj.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1079624\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22127/1079624-jj.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Hero up!</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3010-519\" href=\"/vicarious-visions/3010-519/\" slug=\"vicarious-visions\">      Vicarious Visions</a>, the developer that created the technology that powered the first MUA and handled the PSP and Wii ports of that game, has picked up development duties for Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2. While Marvel Ultimate Alliance lovingly embraced the often corny history of the Marvel Universe, MUA2 opts to focus on a more serious, modern version of it. The net result is a game that's less expansive and enthusiastic than its predecessor, despite being mechanically streamlined and technologically superior.<br/><br/>Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2 borrows much of its story and tone from the Civil War event that took place in the Marvel comic books a few years back. The central premise here is that, after a careless superhero-related disaster that cost hundreds of civilian lives, the US government decides there's been enough collateral damage and clamps down on all the unsanctioned superheroics with the passing of the Superhero Registration Act. While the pro-registration heroes see it as a necessary means of establishing accountability and regaining the public's trust, the anti-registration heroes see it as nothing short of a fascist attack on civil liberties. It's a security-versus-freedom parable that, at least in the Marvel comics, really resonated in a post-9/11 world. <br/><br/>I'll admit that I'm personally disappointed that MUA2 chooses not to pursue the cosmic cliffhanger left by the first game, but the Civil War concept is a strong one, and a terrific justification for pitting your favorite Marvel heroes against each other. The problem with its implementation in MUA2 is the way it pulls its punches with the story. While it's true to the Civil War's brother-on-brother turmoil and unlikely alliances, MUA2 ultimately uses the Civil War as setup for a more far-fetched and less satisfying crisis. The sole respite from all of MUA2's seriousness comes with the presence of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1472\" href=\"/deadpool/3005-1472/\" slug=\"deadpool\">  Deadpool</a>, the Merc with the Mouth, as a playable character. His fourth-wall-breaking shenanigans and free-floating psychosis bring some color to the proceedings, and ultimately made me wish there was more silliness of this nature in MUA2.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22127/1079612-deadpool_mua2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1079612\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.564\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22127/1079612-deadpool_mua2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1079612\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/22127/1079612-deadpool_mua2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Deadpool lightens the mood in more ways than one. </figcaption></figure> Despite these prominent but superficial differences, MUA2 still captures the gameplay of the original quite well. You'll assemble a team of four superheroes from a roster that eventually balloons up to 24 characters and smash your way through wave after wave of robots and quasi-military grunts, taking regular pause for boss battles. It's a slightly different roster from the original MUA, though it still covers all the expected bases with regards to major players like the Avengers, the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-125\" href=\"/x-men/3025-125/\" slug=\"x-men\">     X-Men</a>, and the Fantastic Four. Like the original, you'll earn stat bonuses by playing as one of these teams, as well as more discrete teams like the Avengers (in Original, New, and Secret varieties), and the Thunderbolts. There are also thematic team-ups like agile warriors or femme fatales that you can assemble. <br/><br/>     The nature of the Civil War story means that you'll be squaring off against other heroes more often than you will proper villains, and the locations you'll visit are comparatively less fantastical than those found in MUA. You'll still take a trip to recognizable hotspots like <a data-ref-id=\"3035-663\" href=\"/latveria/3035-663/\" slug=\"latveria\">    Latveria</a>, Wakanda, and the Negative Zone, but much of your time is spent in less colorful military and industrial locales. The Civil War story also necessitates that, after the game's first act, you choose whether to follow a pro- or anti-registration act path. For a time, this limits which heroes you can use, and the story splinters in kind, though you'll visit the same locales either way, just from different perspectives.<br/><br/>Experience is earned through combat and spent on upgrading your heroes' stats and abilities, though heroes that aren't in use still earn experience. You can jump between any of the four currently equipped heroes on the fly when playing solo, and there's support for up to four players both online and off. Additionally, you can swap out any heroes you're currently using on the fly at any time, rather than having to wait until you hit specific checkpoints. These features encourage you to experiment with different combinations of heroes often, rather than just sticking with the same quartet throughout.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/946140-7530_360_022309002_0032_rb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-946140\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/946140-7530_360_022309002_0032_rb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-946140\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/946140-7530_360_022309002_0032_rb.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/946140-7530_360_022309002_0032_rb.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Fusion attacks are as explosive as they are necessary.</figcaption></figure>  There are other minor changes to the MUA formula here, such as health pickups that you can use to revive downed comrades and badges that you can pick up which have team-wide stat effects, but the other big addition to the gameplay in MUA2 is the introduction of fusion attacks. These are basically super-powered team-up attacks that combine two of your heroes' abilities to devastating effect. While there are theoretically hundreds of different fusions to be used, they all break down into three basic types--targeted, guided, and clearing. Targeted attacks are great for knocking off a chunk of a boss's health bar, guided attacks let you run around and decimate any enemies in your path, and clearing attacks create a radius of destruction. These fusion attacks are as powerful as they are visually bombastic, but they lack the variety to keep them fresh throughout.<br/><br/>While MUA played almost exclusively from a bird's-eye, three-quarters perspective, MUA2 is much looser with the camera, allow you to get closer to the action, and locking the perspective when it needs to. Like the environments, the heroes have a grittier overall look, and there's no shortage of over-the-top visual effects. The heroes are plenty chatty, with lots of one-liners during combat and simple dialogue options in between missions, though the voices aren't always spot-on, and the one-liners repeat more often than they ought to.<br/><br/>It's hard not to let the experience of the first MUA color the expectations for MUA2. By those standards, MUA2 isn't as exciting a game, largely due to the choices it makes with the fiction. On its own, though, this is still an enjoyable action RPG romp that makes good use of the Marvel Universe in its own way.", "deck": "It trades its predecessor's goofy fan-service enthusiasm for something approaching relevance and seriousness, but MUA2 still packs a superhero punch.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-201/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21559/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/marvel-ultimate-alliance-2/3030-21559/", "id": 21559, "name": "Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-09-18 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-82471/", "id": 82471, "name": "Marvel Ultimate Alliance 2"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}], "version": "1.0", "limit": 100, "offset": 100, "number_of_total_results": "646"}

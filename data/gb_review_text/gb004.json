In this case, they're all downloadable games like this one. Start with the ability-driven, backtracking gameplay and graph-paper map of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26706\" href=\"/shadow-complex/3030-26706/\" slug=\"shadow-complex\">Shadow Complex</a>, blend in the floaty flight controls of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26101\" href=\"/pixeljunk-shooter/3030-26101/\" slug=\"pixeljunk-shooter\">PixelJunk Shooter</a>, and coat with a beautiful silhouetted art style reminiscent of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30380\" href=\"/limbo/3030-30380/\" slug=\"limbo\">Limbo</a>. The sum of these parts is an airy third entry in this year's Xbox Live Summer of Arcade that won't tax your skills much, but makes for a fun and easygoing ride while it lasts.</p><p style=\"\">Shadow Planet hinges on the same 2D gameplay formula that underpins Shadow Complex, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-3\" href=\"/metroid/3025-3/\" slug=\"metroid\">Metroid</a>, and most of the latter-day <a data-ref-id=\"3025-86\" href=\"/castlevania/3025-86/\" slug=\"castlevania\">Castlevanias</a>, where you continually pick up new abilities as you explore that let you double back and get into previous areas you couldn't access the first time. Here, those abilities include a buzzsaw, tractor beam, reflective laser, and an all-purpose jointed grasping arm that lets you pick up and move objects around, or grab onto certain surfaces and anchor your ship when you're caught in a strong current.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852604-ice_boss.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852604\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852604-ice_boss.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852604\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852604-ice_boss.png\"></a><figcaption>There are some pretty neat boss designs in here.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All of these items operate with sensible dual-joystick controls that especially give the up-close abilities like the saw and grabbing arm a tactile, one-to-one feel. Some of the ranged weapons are a little less reliable, though; it's tough with a couple of them to see where you're going to shoot until you already shoot. Some sort of onscreen aiming cue or reticle would have helped, since the little animated weapons attached to your ship aren't always sufficient on their own, especially when the camera pulls way out in some areas. There are a few other weird inconsistencies in the way the grab arm works and such that make the gameplay occasionally feel a little rough, but there are very few instances where that directly impacts your ability to get through a given area. At least the movement control feels spot-on. You've got great maneuverability, and your ship has the perfect amount of weight to it.</p><p style=\"\">Actually, your very first ability in the game is an omnidirectional scanning beam that shows you exactly which ability to use on each enemy and environmental obstacle you encounter. Of course you're free not to use the scanner if you want to rely on the ol' trial and error, but its presence belies a broader theme in this game's design: it's almost painfully straightforward. From the outset, the map shows you most of the \"points of interest\" where upgrades, collectibles, and ability-specific obstacles are located, and it automatically annotates each of these points with the ability you need to use on it once you've scanned it, so it's especially easy to head back to all the icons for a given ability once you've picked it up.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852603-core.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852603\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852603-core.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852603\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852603-core.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852603-core.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some of the areas have a great sense of scale.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's never any guesswork involved in where you need to go, and very little in where you <i>can</i> go, since all of the nooks and crannies on the shadow planet are quite obvious either on the map or in the course of your exploration. I only found one of what I would truly consider a hidden area in the whole game, yet I finished the campaign lacking only two collectibles out of dozens, and I didn't even go out of my way looking for those. Don't get me wrong, this game is plenty entertaining and offers a lot of unique things to do and look at, but you may feel like you breezed through it and saw most of its sights more leisurely than you'd expect from a game of this type.</p><p style=\"\">It sure is a great-looking game, full of greasy-looking tentacles and weird insectoid enemies that all animate like they're straight out of an animated feature film. That goes for the different environments as well, which have you zooming around underwater, through ice caverns full of laser-reflecting crystals, and in a mechanized area where flying inside rotating gears gives the illusion that the entire world itself is rotating around your stationary ship. There's a unique character to the game's visual presentation that alone nearly makes this game worth the price of admission. It's a joy just to look at. Look at it yourself and you'll see what I'm talking about.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">When you finish the relatively brief campaign, you've still got the \"lantern run\" multiplayer mode, and that might be one of the best things in this package. It's a strictly scrolling-to-the-right affair where you and up to three others use your ship's grabby arm to each drag your own lantern through an increasingly tough obstacle course, all while a screen-spanning tentacle monster relentlessly pursues you. Since the arm counts as a weapon, you have to drop the lantern in cases where you need to fight enemies to advance, or use the arm or buzzsaw to clear other obstacles, so you get into a lot of fast-paced fight-or-flight strategizing from moment to moment here.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852608-sound_boss.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852608\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1852608-sound_boss.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1852608\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852608-sound_boss.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1852608-sound_boss.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>I like how all these screenshots are a different color.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The best part about lantern run is that the order of the enemies and challenges seems to be somewhat randomized each time you play it. The worst part is that the difficulty doesn't seem to differ much (or at all) whether you're playing alone or with other people, making it pretty overwhelming when you're going solo. But lantern run is a blast with a full group of players taking turns carrying lanterns, fighting enemies, and clearing out obstacles so everyone can get through. Lantern run makes high-level demands on your skills that the single-player campaign never does.</p><p style=\"\">Insanely Twisted Shadow Planet may not offer the depth or distraction of the standouts in this specific subgenre, but it still effectively scratches the same itch as those games, and it does it with style.

Like the crime organizations the game focuses on, Yakuza 4 is defiantly traditional in structure, ignoring the advances of modern games in favor of deliberately paced, over-the-top Japanese melodrama, lavish cutscenes, and gameplay that values cinematic production value over interactivity.The problem with Yakuza 4, however, is that the game itself doesn\u2019t always work in favor of the traditions the game reveres so much.

They include <a data-ref-id=\"3005-17700\" href=\"/shun-akiyama/3005-17700/\" slug=\"shun-akiyama\">Akiyama</a>, the laid-back, fiscally irresponsible owner of a loaning business; <a data-ref-id=\"3005-18311\" href=\"/masayoshi-tanimura/3005-18311/\" slug=\"masayoshi-tanimura\">Tanimura</a>, the corrupt rookie cop who takes advantage of illegal enterprises; and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-18310\" href=\"/taiga-saejima/3005-18310/\" slug=\"taiga-saejima\">Saejima</a>, a hulking hitman who has spent 25 years in Tokyo\u2019s secret prisons.</p><p style=\"\">These four all find that their separate paths lead to the murder of a low-ranking gangster, and further events soon thrust them into a conflict that threatens to embroil all of Tokyo in gang violence. The story casts every major organization in Tokyo--the Yakuza, the police, the government-- as members of an elaborate conspiracy, tied into events that happened both in the distant past and in the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7180\" href=\"/yakuza/3030-7180/\" slug=\"yakuza\">Yakuza</a> game. Yakuza 4\u2019s story of corruption and betrayal is so littered with revelations, backstabs, twists, and turns that even <a data-ref-id=\"3005-707\" href=\"/phoenix-wright/3005-707/\" slug=\"phoenix-wright\">Phoenix Wright</a> might describe it as a bit convoluted.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1148232-yakuza9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1148232\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55877616747182\" data-width=\"621\" style=\"width: 621px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1148232-yakuza9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1148232\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1148232-yakuza9.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Tanimura may seem like a scumbag, but he's a scumbag with a good cause.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That ridiculous, twist-heavy story would easily collapse under its own stupid weight if it weren\u2019t anchored by a solid group of characters. The four protagonists of Yakuza 4 bring such emotional conviction to every encounter that you\u2019ll be hard pressed to take the game\u2019s action at arm's length. Even when the game reaches the heights of Japanese melodrama (and it does), the story remains compelling thanks to great voice acting and super-detailed, highly emotive character models that sell the action. It may be ludicrous crime drama (and there are some notable plot holes), but Yakuza 4\u2019s cinematic storyline makes for a fun ride throughout, and offers a very different take on the \u201corganized crime\u201d tales we see in America.</p><p style=\"\">In fact, that feeling of being a cultural anthropologist is one of the best things about playing Yakuza 4. It\u2019s fascinating to see the ways a Japanese developer like <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" slug=\"sega\">Sega</a> would choose to render the kind of hyper-detailed urban environments that have dominated the video game landscape in recent years. The fictional Tokyo district of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2820\" href=\"/kamurocho/3035-2820/\" slug=\"kamurocho\">Kamurocho</a> is depicted with incredibly detailed set dressing. Cooked fowl hanging inside restaurants, secret <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6519\" href=\"/mahjong/3015-6519/\" slug=\"mahjong\">mahjong</a> dens, and ridiculously detailed pachinko machines are just a handful of the weird sights I saw during my time in video-game Tokyo, and they go a long way toward making Kamurocho feel like a real, distinct environment. It\u2019s no surprise why, looking at the game from a distance, so many players think of the Yakuza franchise as the closest thing to a Japanese equivalent of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-6\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/42497/1396304-20599kiryu_02_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396304\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/42497/1396304-20599kiryu_02_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1396304\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/42497/1396304-20599kiryu_02_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/42497/1396304-20599kiryu_02_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Combat is simple but positively brutal.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But beyond the urban city setting, Yakuza 4 has very little in common with GTA or other open world series. Yakuza 4 is a very traditional game, rooted in the conventions of any '90s-era <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13053\" href=\"/final-fantasy-vii/3030-13053/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-vii\">JRPG</a>. With a story objective on the map, you wander through the expansive city, get into various random encounters on the way, play a few minigames to break up the action, and eventually fight an overly powerful boss, all to trigger the next lavish and exciting cutscene that furthers the current story thread.</p><p style=\"\">In keeping with a classic formula, Yakuza 4 sticks with a similarly traditional gameplay convention; the beat-'em-up. Upon entering random combat with one of Kamurocho\u2019s irritable gangs, you'll use a pretty standard assortment of weak and strong attacks to dispatch enemies. In addition to the straightforward tactics of simply hitting your opponents, players can use items that randomly spawn at the start of the fight, and there\u2019s very little in this game more satisfying than beating a person half to death with a tiny Japanese moped. The combat is basic but very satisfying, replete with savage attacks that break opponents' noses and bruise them all over.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">However, the combat isn\u2019t necessarily fluid; unlike more <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-asylum\">modern</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32845\" href=\"/captain-america-super-soldier/3030-32845/\" slug=\"captain-america-super-soldier\">interpretations</a> of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5554\" href=\"/the-matrix-path-of-neo/3030-5554/\" slug=\"the-matrix-path-of-neo\">beat-'em-up</a> that allowed players to reverse their momentum and direction with ease, Yakuza 4 is still utilizes the traditional combo-focused, animation-prioritized combat. As a result, it\u2019s often hard to redirect your attacks at specific opponents, and encounters will too often end with your character taking damage from opponents who you cannot adequately respond to.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/1179068-ryu4_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1179068\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56285714285714\" data-width=\"350\" style=\"width: 350px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/15434/1179068-ryu4_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1179068\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15434/1179068-ryu4_03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/15434/1179068-ryu4_03.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Saejima is the real breakout character in Yakuza 4.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But Yakuza's combat is hardly the game's worst offense. The biggest problem with Yakuza 4 is that every single element in the game serves to halt the game\u2019s momentum. Whether you\u2019re entering into a fight, transitioning between menus, or performing a super move, Yakuza 4 seems to constantly be stopping the action to load some new element. Even performing a character\u2019s super move causes the game to hitch up in order to load the cinematic move into your current fight. It often feels like Yakuza 4\u2019s technology isn\u2019t properly optimized for the game it actually is, and the result is that the game is oftentimes waiting for the technology to catch up to the action.</p><p style=\"\">Yakuza 4 is a tightly packed game, filled with hours and hours of content, but it also feels deliberately contained, filled with barriers preventing you from seeing that content. The city of Kamurocho is technically open for exploration, but it\u2019s very difficult to know where to look for a mission. The game rarely provides information on where to find various side activities or missions. About the only times I found Yakuza 4\u2019s side activities were when the game literally halts story progress and pulls the player into one of these minigames. It\u2019s a bad system that undercuts the tension of the story by introducing a side quest in the most obvious, egregious way possible, and it makes the player feel like they\u2019re <a href=\"http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2000/11/15/\" rel=\"nofollow\">taking time off from an deeply personal, important mission for nonsense</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1148250-yakuza26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1148250\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55735056542811\" data-width=\"619\" style=\"width: 619px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14036/1148250-yakuza26.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1148250\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1148250-yakuza26.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14036/1148250-yakuza26.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>His face is going to be a bloody pulp after this.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">And that just covers the few side missions I was able to find. Over the course of my original playthrough, I barely stumbled upon the game\u2019s vast array of side activities (including gambling, dating hostesses, bowling, baseball, underground tournament fighting, mining, and photography, to name a few). Worse still is that the optional content really doesn\u2019t impact your play at all. Sure, you\u2019ll receive money, special items and new fighting techniques by completing side missions, but you don\u2019t need any of those things to finish the game, and you could go through the entirety of Yakuza 4 without touching a side mission. No optional content has been more optional than the side missions of Yakuza 4. It\u2019s too bad because many of those side missions are ridiculously deep, highly detailed missions with great writing and a ton of value; I spent hours just completing one of these many side quests. Only at the very end of the game does Yakuza 4 open up into a sandbox, allowing you to switch between the four characters and explore the city at your leisure, but it occurs literally 15 minutes before the credits roll. You\u2019ll unlock a sandbox mode that allows you to explore Kamurocho and take on missions at your leisure upon completing the game, but it\u2019s a shame that side content couldn\u2019t be more naturally integrated (or easy to access) from within the core game.</p><p style=\"\">It often seems like Yakuza 4 is conspiring against itself, holding its own cool features back behind technology and game design. It\u2019s not that Yakuza 4 is a bad game, but rather that too many of the game\u2019s eccentricities don\u2019t work in its favor.

Whether or not you\u2019ve played Fruit Ninja on a touchscreen before, it takes some getting used to on Kinect, as it favors quick, forceful movements, and in my experience, it can be touchy about players being either too close to and too far from the Kinect. Really excelling at Fruit Ninja Kinect requires enough coordination to use both hands, though flashy, limber players can make use of their feet as well. I\u2019ll admit, I found Fruit Ninja novel on my iPhone, and there\u2019s something to be said for the increase in scale when playing it on the iPad, but going from using your fingertip to using your whole body in Fruit Ninja Kinect ups the level of engagement by an order of magnitude. Unlike other Kinect titles, the control feels relatively sharp and precise--just like a ninja should, fruit or otherwise.</p><p style=\"\">Three modes make up the game\u2019s single-player experience. Classic mode starts slow and slowly cranks up the number of pieces of fruit tossed up at once, with a three-strike system for fruit that\u2019s allowed to fall off the screen un-sliced, plus game-ending bombs to keep you on your toes. Arcade mode does away with the three-strikes model, and replaces the nihilistic bombs with less-punishing bombs that just penalize your score, instead using a time limit to throttle your score, and introduces the bonus fruit to help you juice it up. Every Arcade session also ends with a pomegranate that, if sliced, causes everything to go super-slo-mo, giving you the opportunity to goose your score by rapidly and repeatedly slicing the fruit as fast as you can. It\u2019s no coincidence that this is both the most physically exhausting and satisfying moments that Fruit Ninja Kinect has to offer, though that's not to say that the rest of the game won't make you break a sweat on its own. Zen mode uses a similar time limit, though does away with the bombs and the bonus fruit. Assuming you\u2019ve got space in your living room, you can play local cooperate and competitive two-player modes as well. As you rack up more fruit executions, you unlock new, optional visual effects for your swiping motions, your silhouette, and the game\u2019s background wallpaper.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/1806835-fnkscreen3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1806835\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14741/1806835-fnkscreen3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1806835\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14741/1806835-fnkscreen3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14741/1806835-fnkscreen3.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Each of these modes is self-contained, in that once you finish a session, which usually lasts just a couple of minutes or less, your options are either to retry the mode you\u2019re in, or hop back to the main menu and pursue another mode. There\u2019s no fixed progression within any of the modes, though that\u2019s a gap filled well by the game\u2019s Challenge mode, which turns your friends <a data-ref-id=\"3015-30\" href=\"/leaderboard/3015-30/\" slug=\"leaderboard\">leaderboard</a> into a competition. If none of your friends are playing Fruit Ninja Kinect, the Challenge mode is admittedly kind of useless. If you do, though, it does a terrific job of incentivizing incrementally improving your score. Since you often have to beat the score of the player just above you on the leaderboard, success in small steps is easily obtained.</p><p style=\"\">When you\u2019re in the game, the simple motion of swiping your limbs through the air is generally quite responsive, though, as can be the case with Kinect games, it can be a little fussy about the calibration. In my experience, the only area where the swipe-based controls are consistently too touchy is in the menus, where it\u2019s easy to accidentally select the wrong menu option with idle gesticulations.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">While the stereotypical karate dojo sound effects can come off as a little canned and cheesy, the squishy splats when you successfully slice a piece of fruit add to the game\u2019s inherent satisfaction, particularly when paired with the accompanying juicy splatters against the background.</p><p style=\"\">More than just a simple proof of concept, Fruit Ninja Kinect is a competent debut for Kinect games on Xbox Live Arcade, and it\u2019s such a good fit that I have a hard time believing it will be outdone anytime soon.

The core gameplay hook--tower defense that lets you jump into any of the turrets and emplacements you build so you can control them directly--remains more or less the same here, but a few key mechanical additions, a healthier selection of gameplay modes, and a lighthearted nostalgic tone make this a well-rounded package that closes out the Summer of Arcade with flair.</p><p style=\"\">I really appreciated the uniquely antique stylings of the first Toy Soldiers; after all, how many <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2189\" href=\"/world-war-i/3015-2189/\" slug=\"world-war-i\">World War I</a>-themed games are even on the market?

But the developers really run wild with the setting in a way that anyone who grew up in the '80s will probably appreciate. There are stylistic touches all over the place that nod toward G.I. Joe, <i>Top Gun</i>, \"The Final Countdown,\" Ivan Drago, and more. Like in the first game, the action is framed in a bedroom toybox motif that lines the edges of the battlefield with stacked-up VHS tapes and monochrome-green CRT monitors. It all feels like it's of an era that I personally find very comforting, but maybe that's just me.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1863428-ts2_flyswatter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863428\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1863428-ts2_flyswatter.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863428\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1863428-ts2_flyswatter.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of the minigames are awfully strange.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The move to a modern setting allows the use of better military hardware, and that's where the tower defense feels a bit more robust and action-oriented in Cold War. Your towers, such as they are, still fall into the same basic categories of anti-infantry machine guns, armor-piercing rockets, long-range artillery, and so on, and now there's an anti-air category that helps you deal with the presence of personnel helicopters, fighter jets, and so on. There are quite a few vehicles of your own (battery-operated, of course) that you can hop into and fight with directly, including a couple of kinds each of helicopters and tanks, and an F-14. You can gain occasional super weapons like a massive artillery barrage, controllable AC-130, or the pinnacle of '80s destructive technology, the nuclear warhead. There's even a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-225\" href=\"/john-rambo/3005-225/\" slug=\"john-rambo\">Rambo</a>-lookin' commando you can control on foot to run around and mow down everything in sight with rockets and a machine gun. Suffice it to say, there's ample diversity among your units.</p><p style=\"\">The 10-mission campaign does a decent job of letting you play with all this stuff and throws you into a wide array of environments, from a jungle to numerous cities, Egypt, and an aircraft carrier. These missions are all pretty straightforward, though. On the normal difficulty, it's generally quite obvious what sorts of turrets you need and where you need them to handily deal with the waves of enemies rolling through. At least hard difficulty is unlocked from the start, and there are two higher difficulties available for each mission after you finish them once. Also, the last boss is a real bastard, which kind of comes out of left field. Mission by mission, the campaign is chock-full of internal achievements (called decorations), challenges, and other milestones that chart your performance in about a zillion different ways, so there's a good feeling of progress throughout.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1863432-ts2_toybox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863432\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1863432-ts2_toybox.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863432\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1863432-ts2_toybox.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1863432-ts2_toybox.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Look at that boom box! Look at that keytar!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In addition to the new toys, Cold War feels more diverse than its predecessor thanks to a better array of multiplayer options. The versus mode seems like the one you'll come back to the most, with three maps that pit you against a single opponent in a battle to use every single turret, vehicle, and special attack the game offers as you vie for supremacy. Since you make money from killing the other guy's stuff, these matches can go on for a long, long time--my first versus match lasted for a grueling 50 minutes--and can feel pretty epic as a result. There's also a cooperative wave-based survival mode that provides a pretty stiff challenge and makes you work together in a fast-paced, dynamic way. A smattering of bizarre minigames that use the game's mechanics to make you shoot down giant flies and guide missiles through weird rotating carnival obstacles rounds out the package and gives you even more to do once you're done with the story mode. Taken as a whole, there's a lot to do here, and it's all pretty good stuff.</p><p style=\"\">As a ridiculous aside, I have to recognize this game's avatar awards as perhaps the best ever offered, with a mullet-and-headband combo for your head and a patched leather bomber jacket combining to make your stupid Xbox person look like an authentic Vietnam-vet peace protester of some sort.

That means the game is set in a world that was conceived before the Internet became quite as crazy it is today, before our society's conspiracy theories got a lot deeper than basic boogeymen like \"the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2875\" href=\"/illuminati/3015-2875/\" slug=\"illuminati\">Illuminati</a>\" and \"Majestic-12.\" It's a world where a Chinese biotech firm still makes sense as an evil organization. And Human Revolution is set at an extremely interesting time in this world's development, as augmented humans and \"normal\" people start to clash along lines both class-based and philosophical. It's an exciting world with a tale that's worth hearing, even if some parts of the performance and gameplay don't hit the same high bar as the others.</p><p style=\"\">In Human Revolution, you play as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8675\" href=\"/adam-jensen/3005-8675/\" slug=\"adam-jensen\">Adam Jensen</a>, an ex-<a data-ref-id=\"3015-1011\" href=\"/police/3015-1011/\" slug=\"police\">SWAT</a> cop who now works in corporate security for a biotech company called Sarif Industries. Sarif is one of the companies leading the charge into human augmentations--implants that can grant their hosts all sorts of superhuman abilities--and it's preparing to send a team of its best scientists to Washington to reveal some game-changing technology when the company is attacked by a crew of augmented soldiers that wants to eradicate all traces of the team and their research before it can be revealed. Jensen barely survives the attack and is reconstructed using a ton of augmented parts, turning him into precisely the type of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-109\" href=\"/robocop/3005-109/\" slug=\"robocop\">RoboCop</a> that Sarif needs to track down the entities responsible for blowing up all that research. It doesn't take long to realize that the conspiracy behind the attack goes deep and requires a bit of globetrotting, taking you from your starting point in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1310\" href=\"/detroit/3035-1310/\" slug=\"detroit\">Detroit</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2713\" href=\"/shanghai/3035-2713/\" slug=\"shanghai\">Shanghai</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1544\" href=\"/montreal/3035-1544/\" slug=\"montreal\">Montreal</a>, and other points of interest.</p><p style=\"\">The way the world is set up and how the story unfolds is the best part about Human Revolution. Positioning itself around the rise of widespread human augmentation gives the story some moral and ethical weight on the subject of transhumanism, which makes for a fantastic backdrop for the rest of the game. That said, you don't necessarily have a ton of moral sway over the proceedings. You can shake people down for rewards on your side missions and take on some missions that aren't quite as noble as your main goal, but it's not really a \"good ending\" or \"evil ending\" sort of game. The choices you make do have some impact, though, most notably on how much information you'll know about what's really going on around you. Between dialogue trees that let you grill various people in different ways and a ton of email to read on pocket secretaries, hacked computers, and so on, there are plenty of things to read and hear about this world of the future. If you're the sort of person that loves to dig into a game's fiction and read every little thing you can, you'll really enjoy this aspect of the game. All told, these things paint a reasonably clear picture about both the important events that are depicted in the game as well as flavor text about the world at large.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868014-2011_08_23_00012.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868014\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"1366\" style=\"width: 1366px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868014-2011_08_23_00012.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868014\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868014-2011_08_23_00012.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Your access to information is limited by how you choose to spend upgrade points as you earn them. For example, you can't even attempt to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6418\" href=\"/hacking-minigames/3015-6418/\" slug=\"hacking-minigames\">hack</a> higher-level terminals unless you spend a handful of points in hacking. You can't get any assistance in your conversations unless you spend a couple of points to activate a personality meter that lets you figure out what sort of person you're talking to and emit pheromones that help you influence the conversation. This type of conversation doesn't happen all that often, though, and most of your discussions will be fairly straightforward. Unless you're mindlessly rushing through everything and skipping side missions, you'll earn enough points over the course of the game to invest in just about any upgrade you find remotely interesting, from recoil reduction to super lungs that let you breathe normally in rooms filled with toxic gas. Some of these abilities allow you to take alternate paths to your objectives. For example, being able to lift heavy vending machines will often let you get to the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-652\" href=\"/air-duct/3055-652/\" slug=\"air-duct\">ventilation ducts</a> hidden behind them. Being able to fall any distance without taking damage lets you drop down deep shafts instead of taking the long way around. And turning invisible with your cloaking system, though limited by your energy reserves, lets you waltz right past <a data-ref-id=\"3055-898\" href=\"/surveillance-camera/3055-898/\" slug=\"surveillance-camera\">security cameras</a>, turrets, and hapless guards. There are also plenty of upgrades that are less essential, but still useful, like aiming upgrades that reduce reticle growth, inventory upgrades, and skin upgrades that make you more resilient. In short, the upgrade system gives you plenty of choices, but there are some crucial ones that you'll probably want to enable earlier rather than later.</p><p style=\"\">Some of those upgrades mitigate the handful of issues that get in Deus Ex's way. The shooting and enemy AI makes a lot of the action flat, with plenty of largely unsatisfying weapons that require you to pump most enemies full of lead. Speaking of lead, it's surprisingly limited, inviting you to spend too much time fiddling with your inventory and filling up your limited inventory space with too many bulky guns, just in case you find more ammo for that particular weapon. The enemies are pretty boneheaded by <a data-ref-id=\"3015-55\" href=\"/cover-system/3015-55/\" slug=\"cover-system\">cover-based shooter</a> standards, and their main tactic when not hiding behind cover themselves is to slowly step back and forth while constantly shooting at where they think you're currently hiding. They also, inexplicably, refuse to shoot through breakable glass in some cases, resulting in situations where you're staring at a room of enemies who activate and step back and forth like they're intending to gun you down, but never open fire. And as soon as you take the initiative and send a bullet of your own through that window, breaking it completely, they all open fire. That's just stupid.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">A stealthy approach ends up being a bit more satisfying, if only because not alerting the enemies and activating them prevents you from seeing their \"tactics.\" You can execute non-lethal takedowns to subdue enemies, and then drag the bodies away before any patrolling guards find the bodies. I found a mix of quiet and loud tactics to be the best fit, which felt a little cheap as it exploited that AI a bit, but you can essentially shoot a guy in the head from cover in such a way that no other enemies see or hear where the shot comes from, but they see the body go down. This causes the dopes to march right over to the body and stand over it in disbelief, giving you plenty of time to shoot the second guard in the head, and so on down the line. Piling up nine bodies in a stack like that is pretty funny, though it makes looting their bodies for the four or five bullets they all seem to carry around kind of laborious. If I was more patient, I would have just stocked up on energy replenishing items and used the cloaking device to simply walk past as many of the enemy encounters as possible. That would still leave you with the game's boss fights, however, which aren't especially engaging. The bosses, though usually fairly chatty, don't give you great feedback about if your chosen method of attack is actually doing any real damage.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868038-2011_08_23_00037.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868038\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56222547584187\" data-width=\"1366\" style=\"width: 1366px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3661/1868038-2011_08_23_00037.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1868038\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868038-2011_08_23_00037.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3661/1868038-2011_08_23_00037.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">The presentation end of Deus Ex: Human Revolution has some high-minded ideas that, depending on your platform of choice, might not hold up as well as you'd hope. Artistically, the game looks wonderful. You really get a sense of the state of the world, from run-down slums to shining future towers that rise high above the waste and poverty found below. Augmented humans, with their crazy robot arms and retractable sunglasses that don't connect in the middle look super cool. And on the PC, the technical end of the bargain holds up just as well, provided you've got a machine that can handle it at a good, high resolution. On consoles, the frame rate bogs down pretty frequently. It's not a deal breaker, and it typically happens when you're just running around the city areas, so it doesn't impact the gameplay that much, but it's very noticeable. The voice acting is pretty scattershot, as well. The gruff-voiced Jensen just sounds ridiculous, and plenty of the other main characters also turn in performances that, at best, are poorly accented. But some of the line delivery, especially with minor characters and unnamed city dwellers, gets so stilted in spots that you wonder if anyone bothered to attempt a second take when recording it.</p><p style=\"\">It has its issues, but it's the world, the setting, and the story that make Human Revolution great. These aspects of the game are so solid that I happily waded through the game's low points in search of the next hackable terminal or other flavor-filled bit of dialogue or text. That stuff is so strong that, unless you're an extreme stickler for the above-mentioned problems, you'll more than likely be able to look past the game's weak points as well.</p>", "deck": "The world of Deus Ex: Human Revolution is absolutely worth seeing, and that trumps any of the little issues that pop up along the way.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-407/", "platforms": "PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21358/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/deus-ex-human-revolution/3030-21358/", "id": 21358, "name": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-08-23 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84570/", "id": 84570, "name": "Deus Ex: Human Revolution"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike-review/1900-408/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48222/1805151-06_sf3screen08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805151\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48222/1805151-06_sf3screen08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805151\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48222/1805151-06_sf3screen08.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The in-game achievement system keeps you informed about your current status.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Do you like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1662\" href=\"/street-fighter-iii/3025-1662/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iii\">Street Fighter III</a>? If you already have an opinion on the game, then all you <i>really</i> need to know about <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a>'s new Online Edition release for <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">Xbox Live Arcade</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-88\" href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/\" slug=\"playstation-network-ps3\">PlayStation Network</a> is that the elements surrounding the game are nicely done, intelligently designed versions of the modes and options we've come to expect from a modern fighting game. It also uses <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7124\" href=\"/ggpo/3015-7124/\" slug=\"ggpo\">GGPO</a>, the netcode that's often hailed as the great savior for online fighting games. It's certainly capable of playing a perfect-feeling game online. But it's probably important for you to know that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1615\" href=\"/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike/3030-1615/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike\">Third Strike Online Edition</a> is not going to magically turn a bad connection into a good one or anything like that.</p><p style=\"\">As for the game itself, it's a more technical fighting game than most, with a parry system that puts a greater emphasis on timing. Third Strike also has plenty of things that carried right over into <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\" href=\"/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iv\">Street Fighter IV</a>, like EX moves and using the two light attack buttons to throw. So if you played a lot of the SFIV series, plenty of those skills will carry over. But you'll have to brush up on a lot of characters that didn't make it into other Capcom fighters, like the robot-in-a-trench-coat, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3100\" href=\"/q/3005-3100/\" slug=\"q\">Q</a>, or the weird, slightly gelatinous mutant, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3116\" href=\"/twelve/3005-3116/\" slug=\"twelve\">Twelve</a>. Back when it was all new, the roster of Street Fighter III was just disappointing. Where were all the characters that people actually enjoyed using? Your <a data-ref-id=\"3005-266\" href=\"/guile/3005-266/\" slug=\"guile\">Guile</a>s, your <a data-ref-id=\"3005-271\" href=\"/e-honda/3005-271/\" slug=\"e-honda\">Honda</a>s, your <a data-ref-id=\"3005-102\" href=\"/sagat/3005-102/\" slug=\"sagat\">Sagat</a>s? Removed from that context, though, the characters are just fine, and it's actually sort of exciting to have a \"new\" cast of characters and new sets of attacks to learn and protect against.</p><p style=\"\">The emulated arcade game feels just fine, when compared to the arcade version. It's a standard six-button fighter, and it's best played with a proper joystick, though it has some of the most flexible and easily edited control options around, so even if you're playing with filthy animals who like their buttons in weird spots, it's easy to swap those around on the fly. Like plenty of other emulated arcade games, Third Strike has several display options, like scan lines and smoothing options to iron out some of the rough pixels of the original artwork. Personally, I like that rough, pixelated look, even if it starts to look a little too blocky when it zooms in on the game's super attacks. It has the standard sort of training modes, letting you practice your best stuff against dummies or even record inputs with one character and then try to parry the playback of those inputs with the other. A set of challenges gives you combos to learn and a set of parry challenges further drive home the importance of learning the timing on every other move in the entire game. There's also a robust replay system and a ton of additional dipswitches that essentially let you rebalance the game yourself, if you feel like you're up to the challenge.</p><p style=\"\">Online, you can get up to eight players together and either play tournament style or in a simple round robin style. When building an unranked player match lobby, you can even ban up to three characters, just in case you're sick of seeing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-212\" href=\"/ken-masters/3005-212/\" slug=\"ken-masters\">Ken</a> everywhere you go. Ranked games are limited to two players and are played with the default settings. Winning ranked games earn you rank points, which funnel into an overall rank that gives you a basic indication, at least, of how many fights a player has won. Some of the menu flow could have been better throughout the online modes. Ranked games dump you back out to the menu instead of offering an easy \"next match\" option. In unranked lobbies, readying up is done as a toggle with one button, so if you don't realize that you're already ready already and tap that button, it'll automatically send you to the back of the line. Minor stuff, overall.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48222/1805145-06_sf3screen03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805145\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48222/1805145-06_sf3screen03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805145\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48222/1805145-06_sf3screen03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can stretch the screen out to 16:9 if you're some kind of filthy monster who can't handle the proper aspect ratio. Seriously, don't be crazy, play it 4:3.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The performance online is totally fine, provided you're matched up with a player to begin with. Like many other Capcom games, Third Strike seems to have trouble getting people connected, and plenty of my attempts to join ranked games have been met with a \"Join Failed\" error, which sends you back to the menu instead of just rolling along and trying to find another opponent. It displays a ping icon when you're matched with another player, but this doesn't always mean that you'll find a smooth game. When you're fighting on a poor connection, the game begins to behave erratically. That shouldn't shock you. But the way it responds can be a little jarring. Instead of limiting you on the input side, the game quickly \"rewinds\" a few frames whenever it gets out of sync. This keeps the game feeling as it should at all times, but the glitchy look of these rewinds can be really crazy. It can also change the course of a fight right before your eyes.</p><p style=\"\">In one especially close online fight, I landed a killing blow, and the sound effect for a KO started playing. Then it rewound a bit back into the fight and showed me what really happened: the other guy smoked me, and I lost the fight. From a latency and network perspective, this is a more accurate take on the fight that makes sense. But in the moment, I think I would have preferred a game that lied about that stuff and got latent the way other fighting games do. Either way, it looks and sounds really crazy when it starts happening and it'll take some getting used to.Every mode is tied together via an in-game achievement system that gives you unlock points for completing specific tasks. Some of these are multilevel challenges, too, so you'll get some points for throwing, like, 10 projectiles, but you'll get more once you throw 500 of them. Some of these are designed to get you into the different modes, and others are character-specific. The points you earn can be used to unlock music and concept art from a separate menu, which isn't a terrific reward, but the points system and the way they're displayed in-game give you some interesting extras to strive for along the way.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It comes from a weird spot in history, but now might just be the right time for Street Fighter III. With SFIV out there satisfying players who want to use that classic cast, there's plenty of room for a game that uses some similar ideas but gives you plenty of new characters to learn and master. And the features that live around the edges of the game are really well-done. It's unfortunate that it isn't easier to get into online matches, but overall, if you're looking for some more characters to beat around, play Third Strike. It's a good game.</p>", "deck": "Even if you completely disregarded Street Fighter III upon its initial release, Third Strike Online Edition is still worth checking out.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-408/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-1615/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike/3030-1615/", "id": 1615, "name": "Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-08-24 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-111008/", "id": 111008, "name": "Street Fighter III: 3rd Strike Online Edition"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/madden-nfl-12-review/1900-409/", "description": "<p style=\"\">In researching my review of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33906\" href=\"/madden-nfl-12/3030-33906/\" slug=\"madden-nfl-12\">Madden NFL 12</a>, I decided to go back and re-read portions of my previous Madden reviews over the course of the last decade. As I read those reviews, a trend emerged, revealing a pattern in the developers' goals that went in a cyclical fashion. One year, the offense was the focus. In another, defense. In one year, casual players were targeted, and in another, the more hardcore set. One year saw major graphical improvements, while another worked on the audio presentation. It's a seesaw effect that, while not directly year-to-year, amounts to a sense of perpetual unrest. Certainly this is true of any game on a yearly development cycle, but with Madden, that cyclical pattern often runs counter to the notion of \"yearly progression.\" If anything, it creates just as many years of depressing regression. With Madden NFL 12, this year is such a year.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870366-dynamicplayerperformance_image331bmpjpgcopy1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870366\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870366-dynamicplayerperformance_image331bmpjpgcopy1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870366\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1870366-dynamicplayerperformance_image331bmpjpgcopy1024x576.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The new tackling animations are certainly more dynamic, if not quite as overtly satisfying.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This year is a \"hardcore\" year. It's also a defensive year, and a graphics year. Put those together, and you should have a game with great new defensive controls, tons of mode tweaks and balances, and stellar visuals, with some glaring issues left unaddressed in the realms of offense, interface, and audio. I can say the latter is true. Not quite as much the former.</p><p style=\"\">If anything, Madden NFL 12's upgrades are less obvious. It's telling that the only videos <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6255\" href=\"/ea-sports/3010-6255/\" slug=\"ea-sports\">EA Sports</a> included to explain to the unread masses what they just paid $60 for pertain to the franchise mode. Simple menus dictate the changes to superstar mode, and the back of the box touts the merits of an all-new collision system and a new Dynamic Player Performance system. Some of these become noteworthy in playing Madden NFL 12, others less so.</p><p style=\"\">The franchise mode, which has clearly seen the lion's share of attention this year, is certainly more robust, if not necessarily finely tuned. Among the host of additions to the off-season modes are player cuts, free agent bidding, and rookie scouting. The player cuts emulate the NFL off-season, with weekly cuts required to get your roster down to the proper number of players as the season begins. This also properly emulates the way a team uses these cuts to evaluate younger talent, as you'll often learn more about a rookie's abilities as they're given more play time throughout the pre-season. Scouting those rookies ahead of time also does this, though it only matters if you actually get to draft the players you scout. Oddly, information is often completely obfuscated for rookies you don't choose to scout. This includes basic combine information like 40 times, strength tests, and whatever else, so you really don't have a frigging clue if a rookie you never bothered to scout is worth a good goddamn.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Just beware the computer. Whatever tasks you assign to the CPU, it will do poorly. Granted, it will do them poorly with aplomb, almost excitedly, in its effort to screw up your best-laid plans. Do not let the computer sign rookies, for it will sign none of them. Do not let the computer scout players for you, for it will largely choose to scout positions you have no apparent need for, and spend most of its time digging up the most minute details on players that will go on to have great careers fixing air conditioners and moonlighting in the UFL. If you choose to avoid the free agent bidding system--which now has you putting in bids for free agents against all other teams at the same time, with two-minute countdown clocks emulating the hours of thought that go into a player's decision to either be paid as the star receiver on a terrible team like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6182\" href=\"/miami-dolphins/3015-6182/\" slug=\"miami-dolphins\">Miami</a>, or win a Super Bowl as the decidedly less-paid third receiver in <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5207\" href=\"/philadelphia-eagles/3015-5207/\" slug=\"philadelphia-eagles\">Philadelphia</a>--you will be screwed.</p><p style=\"\">So in that regard, Madden NFL 12 is perhaps a touch less casual-friendly than last year's title. Still, these changes are far and away the best thing <a data-ref-id=\"3010-422\" href=\"/ea-tiburon/3010-422/\" slug=\"ea-tiburon\">EA Tiburon</a> has done to this mode in ages. Sadly, they seem to have come at the expense of any noteworthy additions in other areas of play. The Ultimate Team mode, Madden's answer to card-battling and absurd opportunities for microtransactions (through card packs you can buy for your team, using actual money), now allows you to trade cards with other teams. Also, there are legend players to collect, ensuring that anyone who actually decides to drop a bunch of cash on this mode will effectively build an unbeatable team. Otherwise, it is conceptually unchanged.</p><p style=\"\">And Superstar mode? It's still Superstar mode, in that it is still a fairly dull waste of everyone's time. So there's that.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870369-dynamicplayerperformance_image411bmpjpgcopy1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870369\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870369-dynamicplayerperformance_image411bmpjpgcopy1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870369\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1870369-dynamicplayerperformance_image411bmpjpgcopy1024x576.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There is so much dirt on that jersey, I can barely stand it.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This being a graphics year, you would expect to be dazzled by Madden NFL 12's visuals. You may be dazzled by the upgrades to the game's concept of deterioration--in any other industry, that sentence would sound ludicrous--with improved dirt, muck, and other junk messing up player's uniforms over the course of a game. You will likely be less wowed by the still-creepy-looking player faces, semi-broken idling animations, and periodic bouts of incorrect players popping up during highlight reels.</p><p style=\"\">That's especially an issue given Madden NFL 12's greater emphasis on a \"television\" style of presentation. More frequent cutaways to highlight \"impact players\" join new camera angles designed to mimic a TV broadcast. Unfortunately, these changes are of little use. The new camera angles aren't useful at all in the context of <i>playing</i> Madden, and too often the announcers will call out the wrong players, or choose an impact player that is playing horribly. Yes, Jason Campbell, with his three interceptions and two fumbles, may in fact be the impact player of the game, but not in the way these announcers seemingly intend him to be.</p><p style=\"\">On the subject of the announcers, they are awful. The team of Gus Johnson and Cris Collinsworth is still a good one, but there are too few lines of dialogue, and too many generic statements among them to endure. You will hear Collinsworth use the same lines about punt returners three times per-game, if not more. You will hear Johnson simultaneously use excited and pacified tones through awkwardly stitched-together pieces of dialogue. For his sake, I really hope that's the designer's fault, and not a sign that he should see a doctor.</p><p style=\"\">And then there is the realm of gameplay. The collision system, designed to eliminate suction between players during hit and tackle animations, and allow for greater \"point-of-contact\" freedom in laying out opposing players, mostly does these things correctly. Players do not magnetize to each other with such frequency as before, but the trade-off is tackling animations that often feel less impactful. While gang-tackles and other such purportedly exciting animations have been added this year, the actual sense of laying out a receiver or running back with a well-placed hit feels strangely muted. In some ways, that's a fair enough trade for the sensation that you are actually controlling the player all the way through their animation, but I can't pretend I didn't miss the feeling of absolutely obliterating some dandy receiver with a barely-legal hit.</p><p style=\"\">While hitting has seen a downturn, the offensive game has seen no turn at all. GameFlow, introduced last year as a play-calling system for people who hate play-calling, has seen a minor adjustment in its presentation, with a new option to scroll through plays called up according to your pre-designed gameplan (or the one you let the computer design for you), while also adjusting to plays that represent a more aggressive or conservative stance. It's a fine concept, albeit one that obfuscates what calls you're actually making by not showing you any of the play art by default. Straight up, Ask Madden is still a more useful feature for easy-going players uninterested in the greater complexities of the game, even if <a data-ref-id=\"3040-33004\" href=\"/john-madden/3040-33004/\" slug=\"john-madden\">John Madden</a> doesn't really talk to you anymore--a loss that doesn't get nearly enough eulogizing, if you ask me.</p><p style=\"\">One might argue that the new Dynamic Player Performance feature is a significant gameplay change. This system, which assigns star ratings to players based on qualities like consistency and confidence, puts players on hot and cold streaks based on performance within a given game. This is most specifically something you'll notice within the game's franchise mode, but it's something you can see come into play during regular games too. If you're playing a shaky rookie quarterback who suddenly makes a great play, his confidence will rise, and you may find yourself with a boost in overall performance. On the opposite side, throw a costly interception, and your QB may suddenly find himself in the company of Vince Young at the local bar, drinking your troubles away. Not literally, of course. Nobody at EA Sports has time to render a CG bar. They did have time to render a CG White House for when you win the Super Bowl, though. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3445\" href=\"/barack-obama/3005-3445/\" slug=\"barack-obama\">Barack Obama</a> is there to congratulate you, too.

None of these changes do. What even translates to \"fun\" in a Madden game at this point in history is almost a useless question. If you're a casual player, that likely means going through a few seasons of franchise, playing your buddies online, perhaps joining an online league (a mode which has seen no significant changes from last year's game), or one of the new communities set up for players to find game types of their own particular liking. Those players will find a game that, by and large, feels a lot like last year's, in that it is competent, competitive, and generally plays the game of football as you would like it. For the more dedicated set, the ones who will pore over Internet forums for the next six to eight months looking for information on slider fixes, patch updates, and desperately in-depth stat adjustments for second- and third-string players, you already stopped reading this review ages ago, because it didn't tell you enough about what sliders to fiddle with or where the roster inaccuracies lie. Essentially, I'm talking to myself right now.</p><p style=\"\">That Madden NFL 12 feels like a less passionate endeavor than even other yearly sports titles, less a labor of love and more a labor of necessity, is a criticism that likely won't mean much to either type of player. It's still video game football in a competitive and compelling environment, especially when played online with friends. It has more content than you will likely ever touch over the course of the next season of real football. In some ways, Madden NFL 12 is a better game than its predecessor. In others, not. It has significant flaws, and it has significant strengths.</p><p style=\"\">In short, Madden NFL 12 is fine.

Even if you <i>are</i> such a person, you'd better have other like-minded individuals around you who want to play against you, in person, on the same console. That's the one way this compilation delivers. Arcade Kollection could have served as a great museum display for three of the most memorable fighting games of the '90s, but there are too few bonus features and too many things wrong with this package to make it recommendable to anyone but the most diehard MK fan.</p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-15743\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3571\" href=\"/mortal-kombat-ii/3030-3571/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat-ii\">Mortal Kombat II</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2178\" href=\"/ultimate-mortal-kombat-3/3030-2178/\" slug=\"ultimate-mortal-kombat-3\">Ultimate Mortal Kombat 3</a> are all here in a no-frills format. In terms of the emulation, the graphics look fine, with a few basic visual filters available to soften the jagged, low-res look that comes along with games this old. All three games generally play like they're supposed to as well, though there's an annoying issue where you lose control of your character for a second when you unpause during a match. Also, I can't in any way recommend you play this game with the old Xbox 360 D-pad. On a Dual Shock 3 or the new 360 controller with the twisting D-pad, the gameplay is fine, though a stick is naturally your best option. It's nice that the game's controls map directly to that special-edition joystick that shipped with the new Mortal Kombat earlier this year.</p><p style=\"\">Since the games look just like you remember them, it's a bit odd the audio in this package doesn't sound the same way. There are numerous cases of certain sound effects canceling out other ones, and a few samples here and there sound like they play back at a noticeably higher fidelity than others. A few sounds, like the clapping from the first game, sound completely different than I remember, almost as if new versions have been added in. The music in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-836\" href=\"/goros-lair/3035-836/\" slug=\"goros-lair\">Goro's Lair</a> consistently cut out for me every time I played that stage.

The list goes on.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1818763-mamep_2011_06_20_13_42_49_93.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1818763\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1680\" style=\"width: 1680px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/106662/1818763-mamep_2011_06_20_13_42_49_93.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1818763\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/106662/1818763-mamep_2011_06_20_13_42_49_93.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Wait, no, this one is.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Absolutely the most disappointing thing about Kollection, though, is the online play, which is painfully laggy at best, and unplayable at worst. All three of the games feel like they're playing in slow motion when you're fighting someone online, and across the numerous matches I played on both 360 and PS3, not one came even close to replicating the feel of playing locally. Making online fighting games feel right is clearly a major challenge, since almost nobody pulls it off, but solid online play is practically the only reason you'd come to this package. Without that, and lacking anyone to fighting against locally, you're stuck playing against the games' hilariously awful AI characters. If that's your situation, you might as well not play at all. Adding insult to injury, the most valuable achievements and trophies here require you to finish the arcade modes of all three games, but at least on the Xbox, those achievements are currently glitchy and aren't guaranteed to actually pop up when you beat any of the games. That's just inexcusable.</p><p style=\"\">The first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15743\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-15743/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a>--with its relatively limited, clunky fighting mechanics--exists mostly as a historical curiosity, but the two sequels are just as fast-paced and fun now as they were back in the day, so in the barest sense, it's nice that this collection gives you a chance to play them all in one place. But that's barely all it does. I love Mortal Kombat as much as anyone, and Mortal Kombat II in particular inspired a fervor in my adolescent self that few games have matched before or since. But given how loveably <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1615\" href=\"/street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike/3030-1615/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iii-3rd-strike\">other classic arcade fighters</a> have been treated recently, the problems and omissions make Arcade Kollection nothing but depressing.

It feels stripped down in an almost accidental way, like someone, somewhere had grand plans about how to make a shooter that doesn't feel at all like the popular games of the day, but they were cut short before they got to put in anything to make this game stand out on its own. What's left is a twitchy, mindless experience filled with weak firearms, poor enemy behavior, bland environments, and multiplayer combat that you wouldn't find acceptable in a $15 downloadable shooter.</p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3010-491\" href=\"/codemasters/3010-491/\" slug=\"codemasters\">Codemasters</a>, however, is attempting to sell Bodycount at full price.The game opens without much fanfare, dropping you into the middle of a war between two nondescript factions in West Africa. Both sides will open fire on you when they see you, so it's in your best interest to just shoot everyone on sight. The game gives you a waypoint, and it's up to you to shoot your way over there in order to get another waypoint. Sometimes you'll find things that must be hacked or disarmed at these points of interest, but you're really just walking up to objects, pushing an interact button, and moving on. The one interesting thing about the structure of the game is that most levels are set up as a large, open zone--it's essentially like playing a campaign out on a game's multiplayer maps. This gives you multiple routes to take, which is at least a nice change of pace from the corridor runs found in just about every other shooter on the market.</p><p style=\"\">That doesn't exactly save Bodycount, though. The core structure of the game is setup around combining together skillful kills. There's no timer on stringing these together, so as long as you never kill anyone in a \"normal\" way, you can extend your streak across an entire level. But the skillshots themselves are mostly basic, including headshots, killing someone with a grenade, environmental kills, shooting someone through cover, stabbing someone in the back with the game's laughably slow melee attacks, shooting someone in the head while you're almost dead, and so on. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-85\" href=\"/headshot/3015-85/\" slug=\"headshot\">Headshots</a>, as you might expect, are the easiest ones to rack up, and the game's default <a data-ref-id=\"3015-145\" href=\"/auto-aim/3015-145/\" slug=\"auto-aim\">auto-aim</a> snaps right to targets. Also, the bullets seem to almost want to hit people in the head. I found myself aiming squarely at a guy's shoulder only to get a headshot after pulling the trigger. Unless someone's right up in your face, it's almost easier to shoot someone in the head than it is to shoot them in the torso. It's kind of silly.</p><p style=\"\">That said, you don't really get much for working up a big combo of skilled kills. At the end of each area, you'll get a score and a letter grade based on your performance. There's also a separate mode that lets you replay campaign levels in order to grind out a higher score. But since none of the skillshots are that exciting, and there isn't much of an in-game benefit to playing that way, the core conceit of the game comes across as almost totally meaningless.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1857591-00369000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1857591\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1857591-00369000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1857591\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1857591-00369000.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">You can carry two weapons at a time, and most of the weapons are fairly standard, with a few <a data-ref-id=\"3055-59\" href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" slug=\"pistol\">pistols</a>, some <a data-ref-id=\"3055-413\" href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" slug=\"assault-rifle\">assault rifles</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotgun</a>, and so on. The game uses a variant of the standard \"left trigger aims, right trigger shoots\" mechanic a little bit by causing you to plant your feet completely when you pull the aim trigger all the way in. Once you do this, the left analog stick is used for leaning and ducking, which might be handy if the AI was able to put up a competent fight. Pulling in the trigger partially lets you aim while continuing to move, an act that just feels weird and, given the design of the game it's found in, is a completely superfluous option. The game's power-ups are a little more useful. As you kill enemies, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4065\" href=\"/crackdown/3030-4065/\" slug=\"crackdown\">Crackdown</a>-like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-566\" href=\"/orbs/3015-566/\" slug=\"orbs\">orbs</a> pop out of them, giving you ammo, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenades</a>, and \"intel.\" You'll never read this intel or get any useful story information out of them, but it fills up a meter that powers your abilities, like one that gives you bullet-stopping armor. The meter drains quickly, so you'll have to act quickly, but it's useful when things get hectic. You can also use that intel to fire some exploding bullets (not that useful), mark targets (ditto), and call in an airstrike that has its uses, but you're almost better off popping your armor and shooting everyone yourself.</p><p style=\"\">It has some interesting ideas that, if placed into a better game, would help set Bodycount apart from the pack. But instead the abilities, quick reloads after deaths, and other little things that the game does right only serve to remind you that the complete package is an utter mess that has no business releasing as a full-priced retail product.</p>", "deck": "Bodycount has a few solid ideas buried underneath layers and layers of boring gameplay.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-411/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30313/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bodycount/3030-30313/", "id": 30313, "name": "Bodycount"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2011-09-02 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-99628/", "id": 99628, "name": "Bodycount"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/resistance-3-review/1900-412/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863301-resistance318893r305havendinerenvironment.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863301\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863301-resistance318893r305havendinerenvironment.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863301\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1863301-resistance318893r305havendinerenvironment.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">To simply say <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29021\" href=\"/resistance-3/3030-29021/\" slug=\"resistance-3\">Resistance 3</a> is the best <a data-ref-id=\"3025-667\" href=\"/resistance/3025-667/\" slug=\"resistance\">Resistance</a> game yet isn't much of a compliment, given that the previous one wasn't very good. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20699\" href=\"/resistance-2/3030-20699/\" slug=\"resistance-2\">Resistance 2</a> buckled under the weight of a sequel trying to do too much.

The Chimera have won, and Earth has moved on and accepted new overlords. It's not fair but it's what happened. Resistance 3 sells you on this eerie feeling immediately, as players wake up and begin exploring Joseph's makeshift town--which is underneath a real one. Humans have become intelligent cockroaches, barely scraping by, and despite everyone's best attempts to put on a smile, it's clearly game over. They're waiting for the axe to fall.</p><p style=\"\">Joseph has a family, one he's worked hard to keep out of conflict. But Joseph's a fighter, and in a world where only war is left, he'll have to fight. Eventually, that fight comes to him. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-18542\" href=\"/fyodor-malikov/3005-18542/\" slug=\"fyodor-malikov\">Dr. Malikov</a>, the foremost scientific expert on the Chimera, recruits Joseph. Dr. Malikov think he has an idea. With the planet quickly cooling thanks to a mysterious tower in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3656\" href=\"/new-york/3035-3656/\" slug=\"new-york\">New York</a>, Dr. Malikov believes destroying said tower will, if nothing else, buy humanity some time. His wife, Susan, sells Joseph on the hopeless pursuit by pointing out the equally hopeless future awaiting their son if the Chimera aren't defeated.</p><p style=\"\">This bleek dramatic tension is punctuated by the game's gorgeous new engine. The lighting is spectacular, put to terrific use to emphasize how little influence our heroes have on the world around them. During one early moment, as the Chimera are walking through what appears to be an abandoned town, you're hunkered inside of an abandoned store, with wood planks covering the walls. The afternoon light seeps in from the outside, splintered apart as each Chimera walks by, and dust hangs in the air. If there was a button that would have allowed me to make Joseph hold his breath, I would've pressed it.</p><p style=\"\">These crucial emotional moments are littered throughout Resistance 3, though too many times the game relies on awkward-looking computer rendered cutscenes that would have been far more effective as in-game vignettes. The ensuing adventure, one that takes players from the midwest to the eastern seaboard, is constantly changing scenery. You're never in one location very long, and by the time you've reached bitter, near-arctic New York, you feel as if as you've been on a real journey.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1805459-fa5bca1bfd761c5c903afba45b7817bc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805459\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5630081300813\" data-width=\"984\" style=\"width: 984px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1805459-fa5bca1bfd761c5c903afba45b7817bc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805459\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39947/1805459-fa5bca1bfd761c5c903afba45b7817bc.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39947/1805459-fa5bca1bfd761c5c903afba45b7817bc.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">All that said, Insomniac makes the same, face-palming mistake from Resistance 2 of placing important story details in notes hidden in the environment, notes tied to unlocking trophies. Added narrative through optional exploration is fine, but please, <i>please</i> don't hide crucial bits of insight within things you may never come across. It's particularly egregious when the game is actively telling you to <i>not</i> explore, such as one big moment, where the music is blaring, encouraging me to <i>run like hell</i>, but I decide to stop, look around a corner, and find a note. Sigh.</p><p style=\"\">But like clockwork, Insomniac's gaming bread and butter, crazy ass weapons, are alive and well in Resistance 3. This one has probably the weirdest, most absurd weapon to date: the Mutator. This one allows players to convert any enemy into a giant...zit? Basically, imagine the GES BioRifle from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17448\" href=\"/unreal-tournament/3030-17448/\" slug=\"unreal-tournament\">Unreal Tournament</a>, except when the goo makes contact with an enemy, they begin to scream, vomit and have large sacks of something or other begin growing all over their body. Eventually, they die and explode everywhere. The alternate fire for the Mutator is a gas dispersal perfect for transforming groups into walking pimples.</p><p style=\"\">Just like the environments, your arsenal is always changing in Resistance 3, with a new weapon being introduced every hour or so. Eventually, this can start to work against the game, as it becomes increasingly difficult to keep tabs on all the different attributes, alternate fires and upgrades of 12 weapons.</p><p style=\"\">Ah, upgrades. Resistance 3 introduces weapon upgrades, ala <a data-ref-id=\"3025-411\" href=\"/ratchet-clank/3025-411/\" slug=\"ratchet-clank\">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a>. Rather than coming across arbitrary add-ons for your various guns, the upgrades are tied to your style of play. Use a weapon, earn points, upgrade. Don't use a weapon, don't earn points, don't get an upgrade. By the end of the campaign, you'll have fully upgraded most of them, but what this style of upgrading system does is reward players who use the weapons they like and massage the completionist gene inside every player. As someone who doesn't care about achievements or trophies, I love this, as I'm unlocking new ways to influence combat by switching up the weapons I use.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1805449-772ecc83c9454fc8bbb3e35ad5635dbc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805449\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5630081300813\" data-width=\"984\" style=\"width: 984px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1805449-772ecc83c9454fc8bbb3e35ad5635dbc.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1805449\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39947/1805449-772ecc83c9454fc8bbb3e35ad5635dbc.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39947/1805449-772ecc83c9454fc8bbb3e35ad5635dbc.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Weapons have always been Resistance's greatest strength, even through the tough times of Resistance 2. Blasting dudes through walls with the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-792\" href=\"/auger/3055-792/\" slug=\"auger\">Auger</a> is never not fun. You always have a seemingly infinite number of options at your disposal during every encounter. I'd often find myself saying \"oh, shit, I forgot I had that.\" There are very few times where it feels like the game is directing you towards a specific piece of equipment, and it's not surprising that's when when the game feels the most limited.</p><p style=\"\">Insomniac appears to have taken a few nods from Valve, as well. When you come across the sniper rifle equivalent, some Chimera start throwing rocks from a distance, each positioned to best show off how this new piece of gunnery would be useful to you. It's showing but not telling, a very Valve trait.</p><p style=\"\">And then there's multiplayer.</p><p style=\"\">Sadly, Resistance 3 does not feature Resistance 2's most inventive multiplayer feature, the co-op campaign. That's been scrapped in favor of a traditional co-op mode programmed into the regular campaign (just make sure to push up the difficulty a notch) and a fairly robust multiplayer mode with a variation on the leveling upgrade path that's become the (increasingly stale) standard since <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1258\" href=\"/modern-warfare/3025-1258/\" slug=\"modern-warfare\">Modern Warfare</a>. Resistance 3's modes aren't offering anything particularly new, but Insomniac's creativity greatly extends to the multiplayer's various unlockable perks. One of my favorites is \"Leaper Corpse,\" which transforms your dead body into three AI-controlled bad little alien dudes. When you've lost a particularly nail biting firefight, unleashing these guys and and nabbing a postmortem kill is particularly satisfying.</p><p style=\"\">It's no surprise the weapons are the star of the show here, and in a world where it's hard to tell the difference between one shooter and the next, simply having combat take on a life of its own is refreshing.</p><p style=\"\">What else? I don't have a 3D TV, but <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4669\" href=\"/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/\" slug=\"playstation-move-support\">Move</a> works. I played through all of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30431\" href=\"/killzone-3/3030-30431/\" slug=\"killzone-3\">Killzone 3</a> with a Move controller, so I've put the accessory through its first-person paces before, but I'm over the novelty now. Like Killzone 3, Move shines best here when utilizing weapons requiring precision control, like sniper rifles. During those moments, the controller translates your tiny hand motions into on-screen jittering, forcing you to question why drinking that third cup of coffee was such a good idea in the first place.</p><p style=\"\">There will be more Resistance games, but whether Insomniac works on them is uncertain. It's left the Resistance universe wide open to new stories, and it's too bad Insomniac wasn't willing to even slightly close the book here. With a <a data-ref-id=\"3045-129\" href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" slug=\"playstation-vita\">Vita</a> spin-off coming, people want more Resistance, so they'll get get it.</p><p style=\"\">Thankfully, Insomniac has sent the series off in style. \"The best Resistance yet\" means something now.</p>", "deck": "Insomniac does a terrific job of making you forget about Resistance 2 with a sad, beautiful journey through the apocalypse.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-412/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29021/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/resistance-3/3030-29021/", "id": 29021, "name": "Resistance 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-09-06 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-105773/", "id": 105773, "name": "Resistance 3"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/driver-san-francisco-review/1900-413/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864411-drvsfs077igrailyardchase.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864411\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864411-drvsfs077igrailyardchase.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864411\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864411-drvsfs077igrailyardchase.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are plenty of licensed cars to bang up around the city.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-31634\" href=\"/driver-san-francisco/3030-31634/\" slug=\"driver-san-francisco\">Driver: San Francisco</a> is a weird game, and that's probably exactly what it needs to be to stand out. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14491\" href=\"/driv3r/3030-14491/\" slug=\"driv3r\">Driver 3</a> was a real mess of a game, and the sloppy 1970s-tinged follow-up, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17604\" href=\"/driver-parallel-lines/3030-17604/\" slug=\"driver-parallel-lines\">Parallel Lines</a>, wasn't much better. Driver: SF adds some interesting mechanics that help keep the action--which is otherwise comprised of your basic open-world driving game missions--from getting too stale. It's backed up by some interesting multiplayer options and a fun story that helps justify the game's mechanics while also giving the entire production a real \"basic cable TV show\" kind of quality that keeps the whole thing light and entertaining.</p><p style=\"\">In the opening moments of Driver: San Francisco, your character, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10862\" href=\"/tanner/3005-10862/\" slug=\"tanner\">John Tanner</a>, is put into a coma during a prison break by his longtime nemesis, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10950\" href=\"/jericho/3005-10950/\" slug=\"jericho\">Charles Jericho</a>. But instead of just giving you eight hours of staring at a hospital bed, the game takes you inside Tanner's head, where everything seems to be proceeding as if nothing ever happened... except for the part where he can leave his body and hover high above <a data-ref-id=\"3035-191\" href=\"/san-francisco/3035-191/\" slug=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</a>. Once you're having an out-of-body experience, you can warp back down into any vehicle in the city. Your possession of people works <i>Quantum Leap</i> style, so you'll look like Tanner, but when he looks in the mirror, he sees the body of the person he's possessing. Same goes for any passengers. With this ability at your fingertips, a lot of the typical driving game missions become a lot easier. Need to take down an opposing racer? Or stop a fleeing criminal? Warp into the driver's seat of a big rig and take them out with a head-on collision. Need to get across the city in a hurry? As you progress through the story, you can go higher and higher, making it a snap to cover great distances. It's pretty cool.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, Tanner still thinks all of this stuff is happening in the real world, and he's a little shocked by these newfound abilities. So a lot of the fun comes from seeing him freak out about it and, eventually, start to figure out what, exactly, has happened to him. The story is broken up into chapters, and much of the actual story unfolds in cutscenes. It all feels like a cheesy buddy cop show with a bit of supernatural weirdness thrown in to freshen it all up a bit, even if it all comes together precisely the way you think it will.</p><p style=\"\">The game is set in an open-world version of San Francisco, which works well because of its varied terrain and extreme hills. That said, if you're a local, don't expect to find your house. It's a stylized take on the city with a handful of the bigger landmarks. The basic districts are where they belong, at least, but the roads are way wider. It also models a bit of Marin County on the other side of the bridge, but the game is so unrealistic that it doesn't even feel that strange that the game always mispronounces the word \"Marin.\" That aside, it's a great-looking version of San Francisco that runs at 60 frames per second, which goes a long way. This helps the game with its sense of speed and makes the whole experience just a little bit more pleasant across the board.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">MIssion-wise, Driver: San Francisco sticks fairly close to the standard sort of design you'd expect from a game that doesn't let you get out of the car. You'll race around in checkpoint races, you'll takedown escaping criminals, get away from chasing enemies, and perform stunts in specific areas. Most of the missions aren't too difficult, though the open-world nature of the game does mean that sometimes the traffic will be lined up in a way that specifically screws you over, which is, of course, frustrating. That said, I only had to retry around four or five missions over the course of the entire game. One of those is the second-to-last mission, which is an amazing moment that I won't spoil, but it's worth noting that at one point it bugged out and prevented me from shifting out of my car, making it impossible to complete the objective. A reset and reload of the game got me back in with no further issues. Shifting from car to car freshens up these old mission ideas, but if you're already totally burnt out on this type of game, it's probably not enough to suck you back in.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864406-drvsfs072igdowntowntraffic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864406\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864406-drvsfs072igdowntowntraffic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864406\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864406-drvsfs072igdowntowntraffic.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's not especially accurate at the street-level, but the game evokes San Francisco quite well.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">On top of the story, which will last you six or seven hours if you skip the superfluous side stuff, the game has an interesting multiplayer side that builds a lot of quick mini games around the shift mechanic. Having a group of cops chasing one runner becomes a lot more interesting when the cops can jump into oncoming traffic, which turns any car into a cop car. When you're getting away, there's a sense of paranoia that comes from knowing that any of the oncoming cars could turn into a cop at a moment's notice and attempt to ram you head-on. Tag and other modes keep the action varied, and you'll earn experience along the way that gives you more multiplayer abilities. If you like, you can also just free-drive around the city with your friends or get into realistic races that disable all of the game's abilities.</p><p style=\"\">It's short and light, but that doesn't mean that Driver: San Francisco is insubstantial.

Everyone from Bacchus to Socrates are represented as opponents of varying levels of vileness, each of whom seek to fight Sisyphus with their own giant boulders, presumably <i>because of reasons</i>.</p><p style=\"\">The whole thing feels like the result of a psychotic episode, stemming from an absinthe- and peyote-fueled night of abject debauchery that eventually resulted in someone on ACE Team's game design team chewing on an art history textbook in an effort to avoid swallowing their own tongue. Whatever pages were left undigested found themselves re-appropriated for use within this game, albeit in the form of cut-and-paste animated sketches that might as well be plucked from <a href=\"http://www.screened.com/terry-gilliam/14-413/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Terry Gilliam's</a> earliest nightmares.

Each stage is essentially a downward maze to be navigated. Your boulder, emblazoned with a face of some fashion, is controlled via the left analog stick, while the camera is assigned to the right stick. You can jump over objects, but otherwise, your job is just to roll, roll, roll. Oh, and periodically obliterate, too.</p><p style=\"\">The tower defense portion of Rock of Ages involves units that you and your opponent can lay down in a boulder's path. Everything from giant turrets, meant to simply slow down and/or block the path of your boulder, to catapults, war elephants, and wind-generators meant to send you off the path (and screaming into the empty abyss below it--wait, why is a boulder able to scream?) can be placed on any colored square on the map. Many of these obstacles are best avoided, but by wrecking into them, you can earn more cash with which to buy more units and upgrades for your boulder on the next go around. From time to time you'll encounter boss fights with great figures from history, including giant dragons, and a behemoth-sized Statue of David equipped with cannons who can only be defeated by repeated boulder blasts to the fig leaf.</p><p style=\"\">It's a really neat, if utterly peculiar idea for a game that, unfortunately, doesn't always quite work out. The game's idea of defense seems, at times, barely sketched out beyond the notion of, \"PUT STUFF HERE I GUESS WHATEVER.\" There are certainly spots that seem best-suited for certain types of units, but it's remarkably easy to just blow past a lot of whatever's in your way and roll right to victory. In this case, victory involves busting through the gate of your opponent's castle, and flattening the screeching, terrified paper person with an oddly satisfying wet fart sound (set to the tune of Mozart's \"Dies Arie,\" which is perfect, given the man's <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mozart_and_scatology\" rel=\"nofollow\">apparent love of scatological humor</a>).</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, the strategy for doing so always seems to revolve around whichever player manages to hit that door three times first. Purportedly, wrecking into the gates with greater amounts of speed/power-ups intact will cause greater damage, but at no point did I ever destroy a gate in less than (or more than) three tries. If you play your defensive units right, sometimes you can overcome a time deficit and come back to beat your foe, but more often than not, whoever gets their boulders rolling fastest ends up the winner.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1879575-rockofagesscreenshots30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1879575\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1879575-rockofagesscreenshots30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1879575\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1879575-rockofagesscreenshots30.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1879575-rockofagesscreenshots30.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>More minigames along the lines of skee-ball would have been nice to have.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That lack of strategic variety does hinder the game's ability to function as a multiplayer game, though it can work to your advantage against the computer, which sometimes just can't deal with turrets set in one particular corner, or a herd of cows placed <i>just so.</i> Rather, you and any interested friends will likely spend more time playing through the skee-ball minigame. Here, you and another player directly race against one another to the bottom of a stage while hitting targets to amass points along the way. The first player to reach the bottom and slide their boulder into one of the holes in the skee-ball target at the bottom ends the round, and the player with the most points wins. It's a game that distills Rock of Ages down to its best parts; namely, the act of rolling a seemingly sentient boulder around and destroying everything in your path for fun and profit. It's just a shame there aren't more minigame options like this. A few extra offerings in place of the relatively dull time trial mode would have gone a long way to adding some girth to Rock of Ages' admittedly meager package.</p><p style=\"\">That said, this is a $10 game, and at that price, you can almost forgive some of Rock of Ages' more rickety elements. This is not a game you play for weeks on end, looking for minute strategic details to latch onto to best take advantage of the top tier boulder-rolling multiplayer competition. Rock of Ages is a curio, a weird art piece that you will instinctively want to show anyone and everyone who dares hover too close to your home gaming setup. And like most art, Rock of Ages is a perfect example of form over function, an aesthetically pleasing (if bewildering) piece of work that demands appreciation, if not necessarily enjoyment in all contexts. Put simply, Rock of Ages is kind of a busted game that I can't recommend to you enough. Play it, experience it, and laugh at the absurdity of it all. You'll get your money's worth.</p>", "deck": "Rock of Ages is as belligerently weird a game as you're ever likely to play, but by all means, you absolutely should play it.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-414/", "platforms": null, "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31679/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/rock-of-ages/3030-31679/", "id": 31679, "name": "Rock of Ages"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-09-07 11:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dead-island-review/1900-415/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9967/1884894-screen_shot_2011_09_09_at_9.41.35_am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1884894\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9967/1884894-screen_shot_2011_09_09_at_9.41.35_am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1884894\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9967/1884894-screen_shot_2011_09_09_at_9.41.35_am.png\"></a><figcaption>Who are these people?

In this case, the unique additions are a sprawling open world and deeply embedded RPG hooks that place this game squarely between Zombie <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\" href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" slug=\"fallout-3\">Fallout</a> and Zombie <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\" href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/\" slug=\"borderlands\">Borderlands</a>, with just a little bit of Zombie, uh, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3025-1342/\" slug=\"left-4-dead\">Left 4 Dead</a> sprinkled in. It's also got some of the most hard-hitting first-person melee combat in any game I can remember, and an optional cooperative element that really broadens its appeal. Dead Island constantly runs the danger of collapsing under its own weird, esoteric technical quirks, but when it's running at full tilt its charms are hard to resist.</p><p style=\"\">There's only a thin wisp of actual storyline here--you're one of four hapless but capable souls marooned on a tropical resort island in the midst of an all-ensnaring zombie outbreak. The game attempts to give all four characters some interesting background at the selection screen: the blunt weapons guy is a one-hit-wonder playing a pity gig at the resort; the blade specialist is the daughter of a high-ranking Hong Kong police official. But none of those stories go anywhere, nor does the main plot thread. You kill zombies throughout the resort, then in the island's lone city, then in the jungle, and would it surprise you to hear the military and Big Pharma might be involved? Does it even matter? (Not really.)</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/1859554-hospital_ward.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859554\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12565/1859554-hospital_ward.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859554\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12565/1859554-hospital_ward.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Guns aren't much good against zombies, actually.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game isn't weaker for the lack of story, since surviving the apocalypse pretty much <i>is</i> the story. The point of Dead Island is to level up, find better weapons, level up some more, and massacre every last zombie that gets in your way. I'll readily admit my weakness for questing in an open world and hunting color-coded loot, and this game scratches that itch very well. It's especially similar to Borderlands, with surviving quest givers congregating around safe houses, giving you tasks that yield experience and rare weapons. Many of the quests simply have you fetching items from one place to another or killing specific targets, but there's enough variety and abundance in the settings and activities to keep things entertaining, especially with better and more unique weapons, abilities, and other trinkets always waiting at the end of each mission.</p><p style=\"\">The parallels to RPGs, and in particular massively multiplayer ones, run deep. The items use green/blue/purple color coding, which everyone who spends much time with video games must be at least passingly familiar with by now. There's a large number of crafting recipes that let you stick nails in a baseball bat to give it a bleeding damage-over-time effect, or wire up batteries to a machete for a chance to electrocute zombies even as you're slicing their limbs off. Each of the four characters--already predisposed to specific combat roles--has a unique skill tree that lets you further customize the way they play. This customization seems tailored toward having the characters work well together in co-op. The blunt weapons guy has a bit more health and can gain an ability that makes nearby zombies more likely to go after him, for example, and heck, the manual actually refers to him as a \"tank.\" If you're burned out on actual MMOs but still get off on their specific set of mechanics, this game is likely for you.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1888970-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.34.55_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888970\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56003223207091\" data-width=\"1241\" style=\"width: 1241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1888970-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.34.55_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888970\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1888970-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.34.55_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1888970-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.34.55_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>It's a big island, and there's a lot to find.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All the upgradable purple weapons in the world aren't much good if the combat doesn't make them fun to use, but Dead Island really delivers in that category. By default, you can mash on the attack button to swing your melee weapons wildly, and the game gives you a loose ability to target specific zombie body parts to break their bones, sever their limbs, or go for critical damage with a blow to the head. That style of combat is already tactically valuable, since you get experience bonuses for doing specific body damage and you can almost completely neuter some of the stronger enemies by taking their arms off and such. But I also really got hooked on the game's analog combat option, which asks you to make unconventional (and at first, uncomfortable) use of the right analog stick in exchange for total control over how you swing your weapon. Want to swing upward in an uppercut motion, or slam your hammer straight down on a zombie's head, or swing right to left to knock multiple enemies in a specific direction--say, off a ledge? You can do all that, and it's immensely satisfying. And from the standpoint of sheer brutality, it helps that the way flesh strips from bones, arms dangle limply from sockets, and shattered heads spout fragments of skull and blood is also extremely impressive, if a bit disturbing.</p><p style=\"\">More than the RPG nuts and bolts, Dead Island nails its setting. The thing that hooked me in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\" href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" slug=\"world-of-warcraft\">World of Warcraft</a> wasn't just the loot-and-leveling treadmill, it was the sense of discovery, the feeling that you were roaming around a fully realized world and constantly encountering unique new areas, events, and people. Dead Island does that specific thing really well. You roam around the resort and find a guy kneeling and sobbing in the middle of a pool of blood, babbling about how he just killed his entire family, or a beachfront bungalow full of apocalyptic partygoers who want you to bring them booze so they can toast the end of the world. You might receive a new quest giver icon on your map simply because you explored a new section of the city and found someone shouting at you from their rooftop. Dilapidated mercenary camps dot the jungle, but then, what's this? A high-tech research lab? The game constantly rewards your exploration of its massive areas with unique new encounters and quests you might have otherwise missed. In place of interesting plot momentum, Dead Island has an interesting world, and that's good enough for me.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1888959-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.31.50_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888959\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55896607431341\" data-width=\"1238\" style=\"width: 1238px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1888959-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.31.50_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888959\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1888959-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.31.50_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1888959-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.31.50_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>He's a big boy! Grrr! Yes he is!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's also great that you can explore that world with up to three other people. That's where the Borderlands comparison feels especially apt, as you traipse around the island completing quests and working together to take down large groups of enemies. Like most co-op games, you can take all of this about as seriously as you want, skipping through quest dialog and getting right down to the business of collecting gas canisters or kicking zombies back and forth. I personally found the game's world so well-realized that I enjoyed it almost entirely by myself, but for those who value atmosphere less than silly hijinks with friends, the cooperative options add a completely different dimension to the game. The game integrates the co-op into your experience really well, giving you cues when other random players are nearby, in case you want to hop right into their games. Of course, you can filter these options for complete privacy if you want, but it's nice that level of integration is there.</p><p style=\"\">I'm not exaggerating when I say Dead Island could have been my favorite game of the year so far, if it weren't for the presence of strange design issues and technical problems so numerous that I don't know where to start talking about them. The game in general feels chaotic and unevenly paced. Early on in the game you'll open up two different safe houses almost simultaneously and then get bombarded with so many side quests your head will spin, but other sections of the game will feel like there's nothing but the main quest line to pursue. Also, though the majority of the game is nice and open, there's a handful of hours that sends you through not just tightly constrained, linear corridors, but the <i>same</i> constrained, linear corridors over and over. The difficulty seems wildly uneven, with some sections of the city area in particular bombarding you with far more enemies than anywhere else. One of the loading screen tips suggests there are some parts of the game too tough for a single player to survive, but if this is one of those areas, it's poorly marked as such. And more to the point, it's kind of offensive that a large swath of the game might not really be accessible to someone who wants to play by themselves. Occasionally the game seems to forget you <i>can</i> play it by yourself, since some cutscenes feature all four player characters, even when you're playing alone. Other times, though, you only see your character. And some NPCs tend to address you as a group, even when you're alone. It's just bizarre.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1888963-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.33.55_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888963\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56048387096774\" data-width=\"1240\" style=\"width: 1240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1888963-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.33.55_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1888963\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1888963-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.33.55_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1888963-screen_shot_2011_09_12_at_3.33.55_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Hell of a time to take a vacation.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's also a host of large and small bugs that never break the game outright but certainly detract from the experience. I had one quest completely disappear from my quest log when I loaded a save game, but I suppose that was karmic retribution for another quest that the game had given me credit for finishing even though I hadn't actually visited the area where you would finish it yet. (Then again, the quest giver in that case literally vanished when I went through a door and came right back in. What?) Issues pop up consistently with the interface as well. Map markers for quest givers and objectives appear and disappear randomly based on some inscrutable set of factors, and I had problems with inventory items refusing to stack, forcing me to drop items temporarily just to pick up objects that I certainly had room to carry. (That's all the more frustrating because the menus are sluggish to navigate even on a good day.) And despite what you may have seen yourself, the game doesn't even consistently let you move between seats in drivable vehicles. That feature only works some of the time, though that may be related to using the analog combat controls. Who can say, or should even try to figure out, why any of this happens? A patch for the console versions of the game is reported to be in testing, and the PC version (which launched in <a data-ref-id=\"1100-3644\" href=\"/not-broken-version-of-dead-island-now-apparently-on-steam/1100-3644/\" slug=\"not-broken-version-of-dead-island-now-apparently-on-steam\">a legitimately broken state</a>) has already been considerably cleaned up with updates, but I'm not convinced this game will ever reach the functional state of most games, on any platform.</p><p style=\"\">Trying to keep a mental catalogue of the things that are wrong with Dead Island, at least in its current state, is kind of exhausting. The good news is, the sum total of those issues still isn't damning enough that I would dissuade you from playing it.

Whether the universe\u2019s <a data-ref-id=\"3015-361\" href=\"/zerg/3015-361/\" slug=\"zerg\">various armies</a> were <a data-ref-id=\"3015-373\" href=\"/protoss/3015-373/\" slug=\"protoss\">lifted directly</a>, or the weapons that defined that universe were merely borrowed as an \u201c<a data-ref-id=\"3055-144\" href=\"/chainsaw-bayonet/3055-144/\" slug=\"chainsaw-bayonet\">homage</a>,\u201d 40K has been plundered by other developers while <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1986\" href=\"/games-workshop-ltd/3010-1986/\" slug=\"games-workshop-ltd\">Games Workshop</a> struggled to properly get its universe out there.</p><p style=\"\">Now, developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1804\" href=\"/relic-entertainment/3010-1804/\" slug=\"relic-entertainment\">Relic</a>--who had great success adapting Warhammer 40K in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-648\" href=\"/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war/3025-648/\" slug=\"warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war\">Dawn of War</a> series--brings the franchise to consoles as a third-person shooter, a genre already teeming with games that sort of look like they're set in the 40K universe. But <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23708\" href=\"/warhammer-40000-space-marine/3030-23708/\" slug=\"warhammer-40000-space-marine\">Space Marine</a> wisely carves out its own unique take on the genre, trading traditional cover-based antics for a balanced mix of satisfying shooting and brutal, effective melee combat. It\u2019s not as interesting a representation of the 40K universe as the Dawn of War games, but Space Marine\u2019s satisfying combat--at range and up close--makes the game stand out.</p><p style=\"\">The titular Space Marine in this game is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1314\" href=\"/ultramarines/3015-1314/\" slug=\"ultramarines\">Ultramarine</a> Captain Titus, member of the Emperor's personal chapter of armor-clad zealots. When one of humanity\u2019s massive forge worlds comes under an invasion of the greenskined orks, Captain Titus and two other chapter members are deployed to hold the planet before the main force arrives on the planet. Upon landing, Titus must turn the tide of the orkish horde and will discover that there are more chaotic forces on the planet than anyone initially expected.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17009/1867057-2011_08_21_00026.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1867057\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17009/1867057-2011_08_21_00026.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1867057\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17009/1867057-2011_08_21_00026.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Slamming down on an Orkish horde from the sky is one of Space Marine's primary joys.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Having a ground-level view of Warhammer 40K\u2019s most iconic forces is the real appeal of Space Marine, and it\u2019s on that front that the game delivers with its unique twist on standard shooter tropes. Relic\u2019s savage game asserts that a centuries-old battle hardened super warrior wearing a suit of hyper-advanced and resilient power armor doesn\u2019t really need to concern himself so much with taking cover. As such, Space Marine\u2019s ruthless combat is an up-close and personal affair. Titus comes to battle with the same kind of defenses as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-175\" href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" slug=\"master-chief\">Master Chief</a>, a layer of shields protecting a health bar. The shield bar regenerates as you might expect from a modern shooter, but no mere health pack will repair your critical line of defense. Instead, Captain Titus can only regain health by getting in close to his orkish enemies, stunning them and then promptly executing them in some vicious, savage, and awesome way. It\u2019s not the most natural game mechanic, but it forces you to stay closer to your enemies than you would normally get in modern third-person shooters, and it leads to that incredibly satisfying moment when, to save yourself from death, you charge directly into the enemy ranks and begin hacking them to death with chainswords and warhammers. It\u2019s exactly the kind of ridiculous gameplay design that shows how <i>badass</i> the Space Marines are, charging directly into the enemy even at their most dire moments.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, that particular design mechanic wouldn\u2019t matter if the core gameplay didn\u2019t measure up, and Space Marine\u2019s wide arsenal of satisfying weapons sell the action. The default <a data-ref-id=\"3055-949\" href=\"/boltgun/3055-949/\" slug=\"boltgun\">Bolter</a> rifle that forms the core of Titus\u2019 gear is an incredibly satisfying machine gun, good at all ranges and perfect for closing the distance between ranged battes and melee masacres. The rest of 40K\u2019s weaponry also makes the transition to a shooter well. From Lascannon sniper shots that obliterate multiple enemies, to the room-clearing Melta gun sweeps, to the satsifying explosive energy shots of the Heavy Plasma gun, Space Marine\u2019s assortment of weapons (and the frequency with which new weapons are introduced) insures that you have multiple ways to clear out the orkish army. Of course, the real star of Space Marine is the melee weapons which slice apart multiple enemies with a single swing and allow you to execute enemies with some great animations. The melee combat may be a little simplistic (you won\u2019t confuse it for modern <a data-ref-id=\"3025-244\" href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" slug=\"god-of-war\">character</a><a data-ref-id=\"3025-147\" href=\"/devil-may-cry/3025-147/\" slug=\"devil-may-cry\">-action games</a>) but it works surprising well as a compliment to the shooting action you\u2019d expect from the genre. The melee and shooting form a fresh combination that helps to underscore why the Space Marines represent the Forge World\u2019s (and humanity\u2019s) best chance against the enemy.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/84896/1860070-spacemarine_mp2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1860070\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1872\" style=\"width: 1872px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/84896/1860070-spacemarine_mp2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1860070\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/84896/1860070-spacemarine_mp2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/84896/1860070-spacemarine_mp2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The three multiplayer classes work well in supporting each other.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Space Marine also allows players the opportunity to get hands-on time on the classic weapons and gear of the 40K universe. Relic\u2019s Dawn of War also faithfully recreated the minutiae of the tabletop game, but that memorable equipment and those classic enemies have never been rendered in more detail than they are in Space Marine. You\u2019ll see (and murder) lovingly detailed Shoota and Slugga Boyz, Squibs and (eventually) Daemons and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1728\" href=\"/chaos-space-marines/3015-1728/\" slug=\"chaos-space-marines\">Chaos Marines</a> as you travel through the skull-strewn gothic stonework that typifies the world of Warhammer 40K. The equipment and environments help to make the world feel consistent and, consequently, seem real and fleshed out.</p><p style=\"\">It\u2019s just too bad that the game\u2019s actual story does nothing to invest you in the game world. Titus\u2019 battle to save the Forge World is mostly cliched, and filled with basic, boring characters. The Dawn of War games do an awesome job of portraying the Space Marines' fanatical devotion to their god-Like Emperor and the extremes to which they\u2019ll go in order to protect humanity and stop the spread of chaos, even if it means eradicating all life on a planet. The Marines are zealots whose devotion is unwavering and who will happily execute a fellow human soldier rather than allow their cowardice. Captain Titus, on the other hand, is a bland straight arrow of a leader, a politically correct Space Marine who too often displays the kind of basic kindness and understanding that the 40K universe avoids. His only real attributes are his devotion to his mission and his ruthless competency. The rest of the game's cast includes Obvious Rookie Who Plays By The Book, Obvious Grizzled Veteran, and Obvious Betrayer, all of whom are called to protect a Maguffin that, in the wrong hands, could destroy the planet or potentially unmake reality. Worst of all, the game directly plays into the object\u2019s role as a Maguffin; the second Titus hands said object to someone else in the story, that character is immediately killed off to keep the plot going. It\u2019s a little disappointing, especially in the wake of Relic\u2019s other games in the franchise, to see such a simple premise for the game, but the core action is still interesting and satisfying enough to make up for the weak story.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">In addition to the game\u2019s six-to-eight-hour campaign, Space Marine offers a multiplayer mode that is far more traditional in scope and content than its single player campaign. The balance between melee combat and ranged attacks is still present, but the focus on that gameplay structure is lessened in favor of class-based gameplay. Players can choose to play as normal or Chaos Space Marine versions of the standard, rifle-bearing tactical marine, the slower, heavy weapon-bearing devastators, and the jet pack equipped, melee-focused assault marines. By dividing and segmenting potential combat roles by class and focusing combat on much smaller groups of enemies, Space Marine loses many of the unique gameplay scenarios that make the single-player game so interesting.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/1407734-1284126_spacemariness1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407734\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56237424547284\" data-width=\"994\" style=\"width: 994px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/1407734-1284126_spacemariness1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407734\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/96/1407734-1284126_spacemariness1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/96/1407734-1284126_spacemariness1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Every day is a chainsword party when you're a Space Marine!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That\u2019s not to say the multiplayer isn\u2019t fun, however. All of the single-player weapons make their way online and are still fun to use. In particular, the assault Marine--with his <a data-ref-id=\"3055-648\" href=\"/jump-jets/3055-648/\" slug=\"jump-jets\">jump jet</a> pack and devastating ground-slam attacks-- is a total blast to play, as he can traverse the entire map with ease and charge directly into enemies. There are only two game modes in Space Marine--Capture the Point and Team Deathmatch-- but both modes work in favor of the class-based structure of the game. And in keeping with the game\u2019s miniature origins, you can customize your marines online with a variety of paint schemes, armor parts, and emblems. The opportunity to hack a Chaos Marine to death as a pink Space Marine is still worth checking out, even if the multiplayer doesn\u2019t always play to the game\u2019s strengths.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, that multiplayer fun is dependent on being able to join a multiplayer game, a simple request that the PS3 version of Space Marine cannot fulfill. Space Marine suffers from some of the slowest matchmaking I have ever seen in a console game, with wait times as long as 20 to 40 minutes to get into a single game. This is made worse by the fact that Space Marine doesn\u2019t kick inactive players from games. I left Space Marine running for two hours unattended, and I still found myself in no multiplayer matches. No matter how far and wide you cast your NAT, you\u2019re probably not going to get multiplayer games any faster. The PC had similar matchmaking problems but was fixed on Relic's end, while the Xbox 360 version's matchmaking works as intended. As a result, the PS3 version is handily the worst version of the three, and although Relic is trying to rush a patch out, you should consider other platforms at the moment if you want to mix it up online.</p><p style=\"\">Still, the core single-player remains unaffected by those online issues, and it\u2019s the real meat of Space Marine. By looking to its own fiction for inspiration, Relic has crafted a fun, exciting shooter that effectively differentiates itself from other games in the genre. Warhammer fans in particular will relish the opportunity to play with the universe\u2019s arsenal, but even non-fans looking for a fun shooter could enjoy Space Marine\u2019s savagery and unique take on the formula. Space Marine isn\u2019t the most substantial release, but it\u2019s a violent ride that proves there is fun to be had by ridding the galaxy of any and all Xenos.</p>", "deck": "Space Marine's balance between melee and ranged combat separates this savage and brutal game from so many other copycat shooters.

A penchant for absurd songs and incorporating deliberately cheesy <a data-ref-id=\"3015-604\" href=\"/full-motion-video/3015-604/\" slug=\"full-motion-video\">FMV</a> has lent character to past releases, though these charms have occasionally taken priority over playability. Simultaneously Twisted Pixel\u2019s most sophisticated and ambitious game, as well as its most amateurish and home-spun, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34073\" href=\"/the-gunstringer/3030-34073/\" slug=\"the-gunstringer\">The Gunstringer</a> stitches <a data-ref-id=\"3035-826\" href=\"/wild-west/3035-826/\" slug=\"wild-west\">Wild West</a> handicraft, enthusiastically low-budget live-action, and simple, tactile <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\" href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" slug=\"kinect-support\">Kinect</a> controls into an experience that\u2019s gleeful in its ridiculousness.</span></p><p style=\"\">While Twisted Pixel\u2019s incorporation of live-action video has previously been relegated to the outer edges, it\u2019s the beating heart in The Gunstringer, which opens with the Twisted Pixel crew and a theater audience of extras preparing for a puppet show. It\u2019s a framing device that\u2019s weaved into the very fabric of the game, with giant, powerful, yet surprisingly baby-soft hands regularly intervening in the action, deliberately stiff and/or hammy audience reaction shots, and boss fights that are regularly viewed from the audience\u2019s perspective. It\u2019s not The Gunstringer\u2019s only trick, and the game\u2019s DIY aesthetic is as defined by a world seemingly crafted out of found household clutter as its pervasive use of FMV.</p><p style=\"\">Credibly narrated by a salty fireside storyteller who is both true to the Wild West motif and in on the joke, The Gunstringer spins the tale of an outlaw marionette brought back from the dead to bring two-fisted, skeletal revenge to the gang that betrayed him. This includes a voodoo priestess, a kung-fu master carved out of jade and appropriately named The Beardmaster, a balloon-busted brothel madam, a literally pot-bellied oil baron, and the barely justified Wavy Tube Man.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1865400-gunbroll11_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1865400\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1865400-gunbroll11_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1865400\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1865400-gunbroll11_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Gunstringer celebrates Dia De Los Muertos in his own, special way.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As the Gunstringer, whose squinty, slant-jawed grimace and ragged poncho more than suggest Clint Eastwood\u2019s Man With No Name, you\u2019ll perform in a series of stage plays, each taking you to a different, somewhat fantastical corner of the Wild West, and each ending in a confrontation with one of your former compadres. That the Gunstringer is a marionette isn\u2019t just for quirkiness\u2019 sake. It's a concept that extends to the game\u2019s fundamental controls, which provide a little lateral movement, plus the ability to hop over certain obstacles, to what is essentially an on-rails shooter. Using your left hand to guide his movements, and your right to guide a targeting reticle that lets you paint up to six targets before kicking back in mock-recoil to trigger the shots, the controls are elegant, intuitive, and responsive--or, at least, they <i>can</i> be.</p><p style=\"\">As with any Kinect game, it seems, The Gunstringer can require a little living-room tweaking to optimize the responsiveness and accuracy of the controls. More than lighting, or whether you\u2019re playing the game standing or sitting, The Gunstringer seems most affected by the player's distance from the Kinect, with six to eight feet of clear space representing the sweet spot in my experience. Your mileage, of course, may vary, but once I adjusted my furniture accordingly, I found the game to be as snappy as any Kinect experience I\u2019ve had, and the ability to play the game while seated--a significant rarity for Kinect games at this point--makes The Gunstringer more flexible than just about anything else available on the platform.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Though it represents the bulk of the action, there\u2019s more to The Gunstringer than just running and gunning, breaking up the action with <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3677\" href=\"/chase/3015-3677/\" slug=\"chase\">chase</a> scenes, cover-based enemy encounters, and sequences that have you brandishing a pair of auto-firing six-shooters, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotgun</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-45\" href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" slug=\"flamethrower\">flamethrower</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1\" href=\"/sword/3055-1/\" slug=\"sword\">sword</a>, or just your bare fists.

You can see just about all of the sights in roughly four hours, and the guided, linear nature of the game limits the replay value somewhat. There are definitely some gags you\u2019ll want to see more than once, and achievement hunters have good reason to revisit previous levels. That said, Twisted Pixel and publisher <a data-ref-id=\"3010-340\" href=\"/microsoft-studios/3010-340/\" slug=\"microsoft-studios\">Microsoft</a> have gone to pretty great lengths to ensure that there\u2019s still plenty of value in this $40 package.</p><p style=\"\">The Gunstringer brims with unlockable bonuses, including mods that can affect gameplay and aesthetics, commentary tracks from the Twisted Pixel team, the <i>Red vs. Blue</i> raconteurs at Rooster Teeth, and Xbox Live community czar <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89829\" href=\"/larry-hryb/3040-89829/\" slug=\"larry-hryb\">Larry Hryb</a>, to name a few, and behind-the-scenes videos, some of which are arguably more magical than the video that made it into the game itself. The Gunstringer also comes bundled with a download code for <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35537\" href=\"/fruit-ninja-kinect/3030-35537/\" slug=\"fruit-ninja-kinect\">Fruit Ninja Kinect</a>, a $10 value and a decent Kinect game in its own right.</p><p style=\"\">The biggest bonus, though, comes in the form of the free, day-one DLC, The Wavy Tube Man Chronicles. I am not speaking in hyperbole when I say that I would pay the full price of admission here for The Wavy Tube Man Chronicles on its own. Then again, my appreciation of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17486\" href=\"/mad-dog-mccree/3030-17486/\" slug=\"mad-dog-mccree\">Mad Dog McCree</a>, the primary source of inspiration for The Wavy Tube Man Chronicles, as well as Troma Entertainment schlockmeister <a data-ref-id=\"3040-101009\" href=\"/lloyd-kaufman/3040-101009/\" slug=\"lloyd-kaufman\">Lloyd Kaufman</a> and <i>Dazed and Confused</i> star Wiley Wiggins, probably runs deeper than it does in most people. Still, as a love letter to the kitchy mid-'90s FMV games to which Twisted Pixel, and The Gunstringer in particular, owes a good deal of its ironic flair, The Wavy Tube Man Chronicles is unmatched in its reverence.

The bleak, vicious world of the future portrayed by the popular tabletop game--where a hyper-advanced humanity fends off total annihilation from all sides thanks to an all-powerful immortal emperor and his legions of devoted, fearless, power-armored disciples--seems ideal for video game adaptation, regardless of genre. The setting was so appealing, in fact, that other game developers were happy to rip off elements of that setting for their games.

It\u2019s not as interesting a representation of the 40K universe as the Dawn of War games, but Space Marine\u2019s satisfying combat--at range and up close--makes the game stand out. It's just too bad that the online matchmaking is totally broken on the PS3, making the game's fun online multiplayer a total chore to experience.</p><p style=\"\">The titular Space Marine in this game is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1314\" href=\"/ultramarines/3015-1314/\" slug=\"ultramarines\">Ultramarine</a> Captain Titus, member of the Emperor's personal chapter of armor-clad zealots.

Relic\u2019s savage game asserts that a centuries-old battle hardened super warrior wearing a suit of hyper-advanced and resilient power armor doesn\u2019t really need to concern himself so much with taking cover. As such, Space Marine\u2019s ruthless combat is an up-close and personal affair. Titus comes to battle with the same kind of defenses as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-175\" href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" slug=\"master-chief\">Master Chief</a>, a layer of shields protecting a health bar. The shield bar regenerates as you might expect from a modern shooter, but no mere health pack will repair your critical line of defense. Instead, Captain Titus can only regain health by getting in close to his orkish enemies, stunning them and then promptly executing them in some vicious, savage, and awesome way. It\u2019s not the most natural game mechanic, but it forces you to stay closer to your enemies than you would normally get in modern third-person shooters, and it leads to that incredibly satisfying moment when, to save yourself from death, you charge directly into the enemy ranks and begin hacking them to death with chainswords and warhammers. It\u2019s exactly the kind of ridiculous gameplay design that shows how <i>badass</i> the Space Marines are, charging directly into the enemy even at their most dire moments.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, that particular design mechanic wouldn\u2019t matter if the core gameplay didn\u2019t measure up, and Space Marine\u2019s wide arsenal of satisfying weapons sell the action. The default <a data-ref-id=\"3055-949\" href=\"/boltgun/3055-949/\" slug=\"boltgun\">Bolter</a> rifle that forms the core of Titus\u2019 gear is an incredibly satisfying machine gun, good at all ranges and perfect for closing the distance between ranged battes and melee masacres. The rest of 40K\u2019s weaponry also makes the transition to a shooter well. From Lascannon sniper shots that obliterate multiple enemies, to the room-clearing Melta gun sweeps, to the satsifying explosive energy shots of the Heavy Plasma gun, Space Marine\u2019s assortment of weapons (and the frequency with which new weapons are introduced) insures that you have multiple ways to clear out the orkish army. Of course, the real star of Space Marine is the melee weapons which slice apart multiple enemies with a single swing and allow you to execute enemies with some great animations. The melee combat may be a little simplistic (you won\u2019t confuse it for modern <a data-ref-id=\"3025-244\" href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" slug=\"god-of-war\">character</a><a data-ref-id=\"3025-147\" href=\"/devil-may-cry/3025-147/\" slug=\"devil-may-cry\">-action games</a>) but it works surprising well as a compliment to the shooting action you\u2019d expect from the genre. The melee and shooting form a fresh combination that helps to underscore why the Space Marines represent the Forge World\u2019s (and humanity\u2019s) best chance against the enemy.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/84896/1860070-spacemarine_mp2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1860070\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1872\" style=\"width: 1872px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/84896/1860070-spacemarine_mp2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1860070\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/84896/1860070-spacemarine_mp2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/84896/1860070-spacemarine_mp2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The three multiplayer classes work well in supporting each other.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Space Marine also allows players the opportunity to get hands-on time on the classic weapons and gear of the 40K universe. Relic\u2019s Dawn of War also faithfully recreated the minutiae of the tabletop game, but that memorable equipment and those classic enemies have never been rendered in more detail than they are in Space Marine. You\u2019ll see (and murder) lovingly detailed Shoota and Slugga Boyz, Squibs and (eventually) Daemons and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1728\" href=\"/chaos-space-marines/3015-1728/\" slug=\"chaos-space-marines\">Chaos Marines</a> as you travel through the skull-strewn gothic stonework that typifies the world of Warhammer 40K. The equipment and environments help to make the world feel consistent and, consequently, seem real and fleshed out.</p><p style=\"\">It\u2019s just too bad that the game\u2019s actual story does nothing to invest you in the game world. Titus\u2019 battle to save the Forge World is mostly cliched, and filled with basic, boring characters. The Dawn of War games do an awesome job of portraying the Space Marines' fanatical devotion to their god-Like Emperor and the extremes to which they\u2019ll go in order to protect humanity and stop the spread of chaos, even if it means eradicating all life on a planet. The Marines are zealots whose devotion is unwavering and who will happily execute a fellow human soldier rather than allow their cowardice. Captain Titus, on the other hand, is a bland straight arrow of a leader, a politically correct Space Marine who too often displays the kind of basic kindness and understanding that the 40K universe avoids. His only real attributes are his devotion to his mission and his ruthless competency. The rest of the game's cast includes Obvious Rookie Who Plays By The Book, Obvious Grizzled Veteran, and Obvious Betrayer, all of whom are called to protect a Maguffin that, in the wrong hands, could destroy the planet or potentially unmake reality. Worst of all, the game directly plays into the object\u2019s role as a Maguffin; the second Titus hands said object to someone else in the story, that character is immediately killed off to keep the plot going. It\u2019s a little disappointing, especially in the wake of Relic\u2019s other games in the franchise, to see such a simple premise for the game, but the core action is still interesting and satisfying enough to make up for the weak story.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">In addition to the game\u2019s six-to-eight-hour campaign, Space Marine offers a multiplayer mode that is far more traditional in scope and content than its single player campaign. The balance between melee combat and ranged attacks is still present, but the focus on that gameplay structure is lessened in favor of class-based gameplay. Players can choose to play as normal or Chaos Space Marine versions of the standard, rifle-bearing tactical marine, the slower, heavy weapon-bearing devastators, and the jet pack equipped, melee-focused assault marines. By dividing and segmenting potential combat roles by class and focusing combat on much smaller groups of enemies, Space Marine loses many of the unique gameplay scenarios that make the single-player game so interesting.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/1407734-1284126_spacemariness1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407734\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56237424547284\" data-width=\"994\" style=\"width: 994px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/96/1407734-1284126_spacemariness1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1407734\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/96/1407734-1284126_spacemariness1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/96/1407734-1284126_spacemariness1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Every day is a chainsword party when you're a Space Marine!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That\u2019s not to say the multiplayer isn\u2019t fun, however. All of the single-player weapons make their way online and are still fun to use. In particular, the assault Marine--with his <a data-ref-id=\"3055-648\" href=\"/jump-jets/3055-648/\" slug=\"jump-jets\">jump jet</a> pack and devastating ground-slam attacks-- is a total blast to play, as he can traverse the entire map with ease and charge directly into enemies. There are only two game modes in Space Marine--Capture the Point and Team Deathmatch-- but both modes work in favor of the class-based structure of the game. And in keeping with the game\u2019s miniature origins, you can customize your marines online with a variety of paint schemes, armor parts, and emblems. The opportunity to hack a Chaos Marine to death as a pink Space Marine is still worth checking out, even if the multiplayer doesn\u2019t always play to the game\u2019s strengths.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, that multiplayer fun is dependent on being able to join a multiplayer game, a simple request that the PS3 version of Space Marine cannot fulfill. Space Marine suffers from some of the slowest matchmaking I have ever seen in a console game, with wait times as long as 20 to 40 minutes to get into a single game. This is made worse by the fact that Space Marine doesn\u2019t kick inactive players from games. I left Space Marine running for two hours unattended, and I still found myself in no multiplayer matches. No matter how far and wide you cast your NAT, you\u2019re probably not going to get multiplayer games any faster. The PC had similar matchmaking problems but was fixed on Relic's end, while the Xbox 360 version's matchmaking works as intended. As a result, the PS3 version is handily the worst version of the three, and although Relic is trying to rush a patch out, you should consider other platforms at the moment if you want to mix it up online.</p><p style=\"\">Still, the core single-player remains unaffected by those online issues, and it\u2019s the real meat of Space Marine. By looking to its own fiction for inspiration, Relic has crafted a fun, exciting shooter that effectively differentiates itself from other games in the genre. Warhammer fans in particular will relish the opportunity to play with the universe\u2019s arsenal, but even non-fans looking for a fun shooter could enjoy Space Marine\u2019s savagery and unique take on the formula. Space Marine isn\u2019t the most substantial release, but it\u2019s a violent ride that proves there is fun to be had by ridding the galaxy of any and all Xenos.</p>", "deck": "Space Marine's brutal single player works just fine on the PS3, but the online matchmaking is so busted that it's clearly the weakest of the three platforms.", "dlc_name": "Exterminatus", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-418/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23708/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/warhammer-40000-space-marine/3030-23708/", "id": 23708, "name": "Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-09-12 13:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Matt"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/gears-of-war-3-review/1900-419/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1891571-popgoessavagedrone.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1891571\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1891571-popgoessavagedrone.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1891571\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1891571-popgoessavagedrone.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some enemies will now burst out of the ground in a completely radical-looking way.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Closure has become something of a rarity in today's video games. Blame it on whatever you want, from the business need to keep popular franchises running until we're all in the grave, to an increasing focus on multiplayer games, but these days it feels like most games set up at least as many questions as they do answers. That's part of what I like about <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30615\" href=\"/gears-of-war-3/3030-30615/\" slug=\"gears-of-war-3\">Gears of War 3</a>. It answers questions. It leaves things in a dramatically different place than they were at the start of the game. If this were to be the final game in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears franchise</a>, it'd be a satisfying place to leave things... not that I believe for a minute that we'll never see a Gears of War 4 or Gears of War: The New Class or something along those lines. But instead of immediately making you wonder about the next game in the line, Gears 3 seems like it's built to last, with both a surprisingly touching story and a set of multiplayer additions that attempts to address the issues that plagued the previous game.</p><p style=\"\">Gears of War 3 is about damaged goods. While it's expected to see <a data-ref-id=\"3005-692\" href=\"/dominic-santiago/3005-692/\" slug=\"dominic-santiago\">Dominic Santiago</a>'s continuing mental breakdown after the loss of his wife in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20662\" href=\"/gears-of-war-2/3030-20662/\" slug=\"gears-of-war-2\">Gears 2</a>, almost every character you can think of is feeling the effects of this longterm war, and the story spends just enough time focusing on the ways that some of the different characters are unravelling to make the game feel like it's about more than just hiding behind boxes and shooting monsters in the face. The game opens with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-180\" href=\"/marcus-fenix/3005-180/\" slug=\"marcus-fenix\">Marcus</a> dreaming about his father, and, as you might expect after the ending of Gears 2, much of this game deals with the revelation that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8467\" href=\"/adam-fenix/3005-8467/\" slug=\"adam-fenix\">Adam Fenix</a> might not have died all those years ago. But the people in and around Delta Squad aren't the only things breaking down. With the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3177\" href=\"/coalition-of-ordered-governments/3015-3177/\" slug=\"coalition-of-ordered-governments\">COG</a> effectively disbanded, there's no government left to back up these soldiers, forcing them to scavenge and trade with other survivors in order to continue the fight against two enemies: the battered-but-definitely-not-beaten <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5529\" href=\"/locust/3015-5529/\" slug=\"locust\">Locust</a> and the wild, infected <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2525\" href=\"/lambent/3015-2525/\" slug=\"lambent\">Lambent</a> creatures, which in the two years since the conclusion of Gears 2 have continued to mutate into something that now only occasionally resembles their original \"irradiated Locust\" look. The human forces appear scrappy and divided in Gears of War 3, and it's exciting to watch their campaign unfold.</p><p style=\"\">You can play through the five acts of the Gears campaign in a few different ways. The online co-op option allows up to four players to play simultaneously, and there's a new arcade mode that turns on score tracking, giving you points for kills, assists, and so on. As you earn points, a points multiplier meter fills, giving you an opportunity for higher scores, but if anyone on the team goes down, that meter quickly begins to drain, giving you a real incentive to keep everyone alive. You can also enable mutators that alter the game a bit. Some make it more difficult and give you extra experience points, like one that requires you to active reload every single time. Others make it easier and reduce the XP you'll earn, like one that gives you infinite ammo. Others are just there for kicks, like one that adds a laugh track to the game. They all sound interesting, but you'll have to play for tons and tons of time if you want to unlock them all, which is pretty unfortunate.</p><p style=\"\">The good news is that you can spend that tons of time in just about any mode. That includes the game's versus multiplayer, which offers the same sorts of game types found in Gears 2, so if you want to capture and hold points there's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1292\" href=\"/king-of-the-hill/3015-1292/\" slug=\"king-of-the-hill\">King of the Hill</a>, or you can always go for more straight-up modes, like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">Team Deathmatch</a>. TDM works with a respawn counter, giving each five-person team 15 respawns to start with. This helps make every death count and keeps matches moving. The game also seems to be attempting to give new players a fighting chance with a new \"casual\" option that jumps you right into a TDM match. But if you reach a specific skill threshold, this option is locked out, forcing you to go up against the regular Gears players in the standard setting.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1891572-beastbloodmount.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1891572\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1891572-beastbloodmount.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1891572\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1891572-beastbloodmount.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Beast mode lets you play as different Locust classes as you chow down on humans.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is the part where dudes roll up behind you every 15 seconds and blow you into chunks with a shotgun blast unless you are too busy rolling up behind them with a shotgun of your own. Great. OK, perhaps that's oversimplifying things a bit, but my point is that Gears 3's multiplayer gameplay hasn't changed dramatically, so those same players who were absolutely <i>raw</i> at Gears of War 2 will pick right up where they left off. Ideally you'll get matched up with players who are at or around your skill level, but my early experiences with the game ended up reminding me that while I think the competitive multiplayer in Gears is well-designed and exciting, playing it against people who play a lot of it is frustrating in an \"I guess I'll just turn this off now\" way, not a \"Gee, I'm going to strive to get better so this stops happening\" sort of way. I will grant you that this is more of a personal issue and not an actual problem with the game itself, and for those of you in a similar situation, there's always <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\" href=\"/horde/3015-3021/\" slug=\"horde\">Horde</a> mode.</p><p style=\"\">The wave-based survival mode that first popularized the style returns with some solid enhancements in Gears of War 3. Horde mode is still all about five guys working together to take down tons of AI enemies on the game's multiplayer maps. But now it almost has a tower defense sort of feel. You'll earn money for kills, and between rounds you can spend that cash on barriers that slow the enemy's progress, turrets that you can operate manually, decoys that distract your foes, and so on. Every tenth wave pits your crew against a random boss battle--you might end up facing two berzerkers, or maybe an effing <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1142\" href=\"/brumak/3015-1142/\" slug=\"brumak\">brumak</a> will show up and ruin your day. Picking up weapons or refilling your ammo also costs money, which means that the new Horde mode is a mix of the old Horde mode, some sort of tower defense-like structural accoutrements, and the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-79\" href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" slug=\"zombie\">Zombies</a> mode from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1488\" href=\"/treyarch/3010-1488/\" slug=\"treyarch\">Treyarch</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> games. While I'm not a huge fan of those inspirations, they come together really well and make an already solid Gears 2 mode even better.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">There's also a new mode called Beast that, in some ways, acts as an inverted Horde mode. It's another five-player co-op mode, but now you're playing as the Locust and attempting to kill humans that have holed up behind barricades and other obstacles in the game's multiplayer maps. It's also class-based, requiring you to spend the money you get for each round to spawn as different Horde species. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2253\" href=\"/tickers/3015-2253/\" slug=\"tickers\">Tickers</a> are the best at bashing through the barbed-wire fences and other obstacles that slow down your team, so it's best to select them up front to expose the humans before moving in with bloodmounts, boomers, serapedes, and other heavy Locust artillery. The catch is that all of this starts with a 60-second timer, requiring you and your team to move extremely quickly if you want to complete a round, though not quite as quickly as that might sound. Everything you attack adds a second or two to your timer. It's a fast, frantic mode that feels nicely different from anything else on the disc. It's a pretty cool change of pace.</p><p style=\"\">All of this online action will, theoretically, work better than it did in Gears of War 2. After numerous complaints about host advantages and other online shenanigans, the game's matches have moved onto dedicated servers. This is a behind-the-scenes change, for the most part. You won't see a server browser or anything like that, and the only place where you get options about which weapons you want to allow in a game or which map you want to play on is when you're setting up a private game. You can also play against bots in those private games, if you like, but only in the versus multiplayer. Bots can't play Horde or Beast with you. Bots can, technically, also appear in public quick match games, but I suspect that once the game is widely available, you probably won't see a lot of non-human players in those matches.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1891573-explodingdrudge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1891573\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1891573-explodingdrudge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1891573\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1891573-explodingdrudge.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1891573-explodingdrudge.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Lambent creatures blow up real good.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Visually, Gears of War 3 is a step up from the previous game. The campaign takes you across a lot of different locations, and you'll see some great weather effects and lighting along the way. You'll also see plenty of great explosions, and some of the best bangs come out of the Lambent creatures, which pop in a really satisfying way when you take them down. That said, the game's cutscenes often suffer from frame rate issues, as they have in the past. The game also has 3D support, but I found the 3D mode to be sort of a blurry, murky mess. Even with the brightness cranked up, it was difficult to see enemies in some cases, and on-screen text is chunkier and a lot harder to read. Your mileage may vary, I guess, but my official advice is to leave the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1204\" href=\"/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/\" slug=\"stereoscopic-3d\">3D</a> mode alone. It's not worth it.</p><p style=\"\">Gears of War 3 manages to leave a question or two unanswered, but those holes aren't big enough to drive a sequel through. When the next Gears of War comes along--and lets not be naive about these things, we'll almost certainly see another Gears of War game someday--it'll probably have to be a fairly dramatic shift, from a story perspective. The members of Delta Squad have finally found some closure, and, for all of the derisive things the world lobs at Gears' totally-broed-out motif, the story even manages to be touching on multiple occasions. It's a joy to play, and the game's expanded set of multiplayer options will give you plenty of things to keep you busy for a good, long time.

But that single-player is pretty short and designed to be replayed endlessly--something that made a lot of sense back on the N64. But shifting standards give it all a very different feel today. As a result, Star Fox 64 3D comes across like a video game stuck in the past, an aging release that, for all of its lavish visual upgrades, feels archaic. Even if you're willing to pay a premium to see Star Fox 64 again, you may not get what you expect, as the port contains enough small but meaningful alterations from the original release that it loses some of its nostalgic power.</p><p style=\"\">It\u2019s too bad, because Star Fox 64 3D does faithfully recreate the original game\u2019s single-player campaign. You won\u2019t find any new planets to visit, new warps or power-ups. This is a pretty straight port with a few extraneous additional features and no real surprises. Enemy locations, item placement and boss battles are identical to their locations and strategies from 14 years ago. You\u2019ll still charge your laser to destroy enemies, launch bombs to clear the screen, disarm different bombs, fight <a data-ref-id=\"3005-915\" href=\"/wolf-odonnell/3005-915/\" slug=\"wolf-odonnell\">Star Wolf</a> and, yes, even do a barrel roll or two. And that campaign is still pretty fun, constantly shifting your objectives from level to level to keep each mission fresh. You\u2019ll traverse <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2945\" href=\"/meteo/3035-2945/\" slug=\"meteo\">asteroid fields</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2939\" href=\"/katina/3035-2939/\" slug=\"katina\">blow up motherships</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2935\" href=\"/sector-z/3035-2935/\" slug=\"sector-z\">defend your mobile starbase</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3055-924\" href=\"/great-fox/3055-924/\" slug=\"great-fox\">Great Fox</a> from missles, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2931\" href=\"/macbeth/3035-2931/\" slug=\"macbeth\">cut off a supply line by crashing the transport train into an enemy base</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2953\" href=\"/bolse/3035-2953/\" slug=\"bolse\">destroy a planet\u2019s satellite defense platform</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1443\" href=\"/andross/3005-1443/\" slug=\"andross\">even fight a giant brain</a>.

You do this.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The graphical overhaul in Star Fox 64 3D is probably even more dramatic than the recently updated port of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31776\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d/3030-31776/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time-3d\">Ocarina of Time</a>. Crisp ground textures below your ship have craggy, uneven, rocky surfaces instead of a single color painted across the map. Water and lava churn and splash with a ferocity you\u2019d never dream of seeing on the N64. The new skyboxes are far richer and more animated than you remember. It\u2019s a great look that does inject some new life into this fondly remembered game.</p><p style=\"\">Star Fox 64 also does extremely well in 3D, which works without a hitch and enhances the game without becoming distracting. Enemies and environmental objects alike tumble through space, out of the screen and into your line of sight (and occasionally, your ship). It\u2019s a great-looking effect that works nicely even on the highest 3D settings.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">With such a cool visual makeover on top of an already memorable and fun campaign, Star Fox 64 3D seems like it does everything right to appeal to its nostalgic fan base and bring in new fans at the same time. But the high levels of reverence for the original game end there, as Star Fox 64 3D makes too many decisions that detract from its nostalgic appeal. Chief amongst those offenses--especially for fans of the original game-- is the rerecording of the game\u2019s famous voice acting. For whatever reason, Nintendo and Q-Games opted to bring the original voice actors back into the studio to once again capture that specific mixture of silly cliches, bizarre inflections and G-rated thrills that made the original characters memorable. But apparently that magic is gone forever, because the cast just can\u2019t hit those notes you and I remember. Inflections are wrong, lines have been changed, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-420\" href=\"/falco-lombardi/3005-420/\" slug=\"falco-lombardi\">Falco</a> sounds way too much like a jerk, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-418\" href=\"/fox-mccloud/3005-418/\" slug=\"fox-mccloud\">Fox</a> comes across like a whiner, and Andross\u2019 crazy hyena laugh has completely vanished. Nintendo has clearly gone through a lot of work to recreate that lost voice acting with high-quality audio. But with no option to play those classic voice tracks, Star Fox 64 3D is left with a facsimile that doesn\u2019t deliver the same thrills.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1844655-6_3ds_starfox64_3_scrn08_e3_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1844655\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2115384615385\" data-width=\"624\" style=\"width: 624px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1844655-6_3ds_starfox64_3_scrn08_e3_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1844655\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1844655-6_3ds_starfox64_3_scrn08_e3_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1844655-6_3ds_starfox64_3_scrn08_e3_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Sorry to jet, but I'm in a hurry.\"</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Similarly, Star Fox 64 3D\u2019s music tracks have similarly been rerecorded and also replaced with far less memorable instrumentation that tries and fails to recreate the original N64 songs. Star Fox 64 3D could have handled either a direct emulation of those original tunes or a proper orchestral arrangement, but instead opts to emulate the sound of the N64 chip, which was in turn trying to emulate proper orchestrations. As a result, some of the game\u2019s tracks sound like they\u2019re coming out of a cheap keyboard, robbing them of their energy and scope.</p><p style=\"\">Still, the changes to the music and voice acting are really only going to rub you wrong if you're a Star Fox purist, but that\u2019s the group of players most likely to enjoy this premium remake. If you\u2019re a new player curious why many have fussed about this game for so long, you\u2019re going to wonder why this short, simple, and easy rail shooter costs $40 while other games in the genre offer more features (including online hooks) for a quarter of the price. For as much work as has gone into this re-release, the core of Star Fox 64 3D is untouched and, as such, feels shallow and lacking in content compared to similarly priced games today.</p><p style=\"\">And while there are a few 3DS-specifc features in this port, none of them are substantial enough or fleshed out enough to merit the full-price investment. In true Nintendo form, Star Fox 64 3D has optional <a data-ref-id=\"3015-474\" href=\"/motion-control/3015-474/\" slug=\"motion-control\">motion-based controls</a>, allowing you to steer your jets and tanks using the handheld\u2019s gyroscope. But the motion controls sacrifice some of the required precision needed, even on the easier difficulty, to clear each stage, along with making it impossible to use the game\u2019s legitimately great 3D effects. The controls work, but they\u2019re not fun to use, especially since the handheld circle pad works just fine for playing Star Fox on all the difficulty settings.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1843547-i_29822.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1843547\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.2115384615385\" data-width=\"416\" style=\"width: 416px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1843547-i_29822.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1843547\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1843547-i_29822.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1843547-i_29822.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>$40 for a two hour game? Can't let you do that, Star Fox.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Along with the new motion controls, Star Fox 64 3D also makes substantial upgrades to the original game\u2019s multiplayer Battle Mode. Thankfully, the 3DS battle mode has lost the dense fog that plagued the original game\u2019s multiplayer and enhanced the various game options. The brand new battle mode features expansive maps with some new geometry, as well as a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-507\" href=\"/mario-kart/3025-507/\" slug=\"mario-kart\">Mario Kart</a>-inspired powerup system that adds a few additional pickups, such as cloaking, to the expected arsenal. And, in a neat touch, the game\u2019s multiplayer supports <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2407\" href=\"/single-card-download-play/3015-2407/\" slug=\"single-card-download-play\">download play</a>, which means all you need to get the full multiplayer options and settings across multiple players is a single cart. In a goofier, less meaningful addition, the 3DS\u2019 front-facing camera will capture your face during your match and display it over the pilot\u2019s aircraft as well as after a kill. It\u2019s ridiculous in the same way that feature was in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5648\" href=\"/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/\" slug=\"burnout-paradise\">Burnout Paradise</a>, but given the 30-foot maximum range for the wireless local multiplayer, it\u2019s a feature that essentially duplicates the act of looking at a person\u2019s face. It\u2019s a silly diversion but it\u2019s not the best reason to come to this port.</p><p style=\"\">But those are the kinds of features that get added to games when the developers are stuck making a straight remake instead of adding the meaningful, substantial additions and upgrades that could have made Star Fox 64 3D a more robust package. The desire for a straight nostalgic recreation of the original game forbids the addition of the very features that would have made the game truly modern. As a result, we\u2019re left with this rail shooter without online multiplayer, online leaderboards for single-player, new levels, new boss fights, or even a real orchestral score. Those are the kinds of features game players demand from games that cost half of what Star Fox 64 3D retails for. The game at its center may still be fun, but it\u2019s not fun for long enough to overlook the game\u2019s simplicity, its short length, and its lack of modern gameplay features. If you\u2019re looking for the history lesson, you\u2019re better off grabbing it for $10 on the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2925\" href=\"/virtual-console/3015-2925/\" slug=\"virtual-console\">Virtual Console</a>.</p>", "deck": "Star Fox 64 3D is too short and feature-deprived at $40 to satisfy newcomers while missing some of the nostalgic hooks that made its predecessor beloved.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-420/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31757/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/star-fox-64-3d/3030-31757/", "id": 31757, "name": "Star Fox 64 3D"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-09-16 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101626/", "id": 101626, "name": "Star Fox 64 3D"}, "reviewer": "Matt"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/renegade-ops-review/1900-421/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1891051-roexpolosion2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1891051\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1891051-roexpolosion2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1891051\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1891051-roexpolosion2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Blow all that shit up!

Luckily for us, whoever had that idea was right on the money. This game is a blast.</p><p style=\"\">It's probably not a surprise that Renegade Ops is so much fun purely because of the way it plays. The cars have low traction and an almost perfect feeling of weight to them, allowing you to kick out your back end as you skid around corners, spin a quick 180, or just do donuts forever if that's your thing. The game uses dual-joystick controls, so while you're sliding around every which way, you can shoot every which other way at the same time, allowing you to dodge around the smaller vehicular enemies and run circles around the larger tanks, blasting them constantly. Everything about the feel of the combat, particularly the fully upgraded regular machine gun and add-on weapons like rockets and a railgun, is solid and hard-hitting and really satisfying.</p><p style=\"\">The game looks darn good, considering it's downloadable and uses an overhead perspective. There's so much height to some of the maps, as you drive through canyons and over hills and such, that the terrain closer to the camera blurs out with a depth-of-field effect. More importantly, everything explodes real nice.

My promise to you.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Renegade Ops sure doesn't take itself very seriously, casting you as a team of maverick operators who go rogue to stop a sinister army led by the cackling bald psychopath Inferno. The game makes its over-the-top tone evident right upfront, when your hard-nosed CO literally hurls his fistful of medals at a room of lily-livered UN diplomats and declares his intention to get this mess taken care of himself. It's all guitar riffs and incendiaries from there. One mission objective that sticks out in my memory is simply, \"Get out of there.\" Another one urges you to outrun the blast from a nuclear warhead and basically just has you driving in a straight line as fast as you can. It's that kind of game.</p><p style=\"\">Proving that just about any style of game can accommodate RPG mechanics, there's persistent leveling and a talent tree used to good effect here. You can pick from four playable characters, each with a different-looking vehicle that handles more or less the same. They have different special abilities, though, and a unique skill tree that just distributes the same set of useful abilities in a different order. At first I couldn't figure out a reason anyone would play a character other than the spunky girl with the giant airstrike, but as the game gets tougher there are cases where other abilities, like the heavy guy's thick armored shield, certainly come in handy too. Each character has discrete experience so you level them separately, and you can mix and match them throughout a playthrough on each mission, or even take them into co-op that goes up to four players online. The frame rate can bog down a bit in two-player splitscreen or when four players are just going crazy with their weapons online, but them's the breaks.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1796750-renegade_ops_playstation_3_ps3_1305655449_010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1796750\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1796750-renegade_ops_playstation_3_ps3_1305655449_010.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1796750\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1796750-renegade_ops_playstation_3_ps3_1305655449_010.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1796750-renegade_ops_playstation_3_ps3_1305655449_010.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Oh yeah, sometimes you fly a helicopter.

Also, if you're into achievements and trophies, there's one for going back and beating every level on the considerably more difficult Hardcore mode, which you can do either alone or with friends. I'm not usually big on going back and replaying games for that sort of reason, but the core action is so much fun here that I'll take any excuse to play through this one again. The difficulty doesn't scale to the number of players, making the normal setting feel like a breeze for a team of four, so in that sense, Hardcore is probably the best way to play in a group anyway.</p><p style=\"\">Renegade Ops feels like the model of a fantastic downloadable game designed to the strengths of digital distribution.

This assertion is not the result of any big, game-changing feature introduced in this, the 20th iteration of EA's hockey franchise. Nor does it stem from some long-ignored element finally getting its proper due this time around. Rather, NHL 12's success comes from a million little things all coming together at once. The minor tweaks, basic adjustments, and new features all come together into a play experience that is wonderfully competitive, perhaps more so than any other hockey game before it. This is no big leap forward for the franchise, mind you--comparatively, it's almost less of a leap over <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26458\" href=\"/nhl-10/3030-26458/\" slug=\"nhl-10\">NHL 10</a> than <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29997\" href=\"/nhl-11/3030-29997/\" slug=\"nhl-11\">NHL 11</a> was--but for those who just want to tool around with their favorite franchise, build up a pro of their own design, and hop online against the masses of like-minded players, NHL 12 shan't disappoint.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78531/1881140-nhl12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1881140\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56229508196721\" data-width=\"610\" style=\"width: 610px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78531/1881140-nhl12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1881140\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/78531/1881140-nhl12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Play down in front of the net has never been as realistically thrilling as it is in NHL 12.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Again, where NHL 12 shines brightest is on the ice. The biggest change you are likely to notice over NHL 11 is in pertinence to goalies. Once built as monolithic, immobile beasts you couldn't cut through with a burning saber, goalies now behave as real players do. They can be pushed out of the net, they can be crashed into, and my lord, they can even be fought with. They're human beings now, with all the encumbrances that sudden mortal status entails. Much of this has to do with the new \"full contact physics engine.\" While that sounds like a meaningless marketing buzz term, there is an appreciable difference in how players move and interact on the ice this year. Pinning players to the boards, engaging in tight battles in front of the net with agitated defensemen, and yes, again, crashing that infernal goalie actually feels realistic, and damn good as well.</p><p style=\"\">Another change involves player styles and roles. Let's face it: these games have always lived and died by their playmakers. The power forwards, grinders, and other lumbering puck jockeys not specifically tuned toward scoring plays have never been as useful as they are in real life. Now, subtle AI tweaks have fixed a lot of that. Offensive defensemen will push closer to the net and do their best to stay in position for a one-timer. Power forwards will make it a point to stay in front of the net and challenge defenders in order to pick up rebounds and garbage goals. Essentially, it's the way it ought to be.</p><p style=\"\">While this does fix a lot of the stiffer, more robotic issues that sometimes permeated previous NHL titles, it also has occasional flaws, especially with scoring. The shot stick mechanics are as tight as ever--though stick-based faceoff mechanics need some fine tuning--but some of the AI behaviors occasionally break down into predictable patterns that can be exploited, especially when it comes to scoring chances. The wraparound goal is one that borders on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-578\" href=\"/money-play/3015-578/\" slug=\"money-play\">Madden Money Play</a> territory. It ain't a 100% guarantee, but all it usually takes is one d-man a hair out of place to put an easy wraparound past a bewildered goalie. Getting past that defense can still be a challenge, hence why it's not quite a money play, but goalies just don't seem quite as adept at defending against that far side wraparound shot. I also found it a tad too easy to just blatantly interfere with goaltenders, and also that my defenders would take a lot of really boneheaded interference penalties for no good reason. It's one of those balance tweaks that, hopefully, EA will fix up somewhere down the line.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78531/1881138-nhl_12_talbot_656x369.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1881138\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"656\" style=\"width: 656px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/78531/1881138-nhl_12_talbot_656x369.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1881138\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/78531/1881138-nhl_12_talbot_656x369.jpg\"></a><figcaption>With the press of a button, you can jab at an opposing player to try and goad them into a fight.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One other mechanical tweak EA made is to fighting. This is one of those sticky wickets that hockey games have never successfully tackled, and while this year's version of it isn't perfect, it feels tighter, and more reasonable than any game that's tried before. Strangely, this is one of those features I discovered largely on accident, as it's not really promoted anywhere in the game outside of a brief tutorial. That said, considering the sheer volume of <a href=\"http://www.usatoday.com/sports/hockey/nhl/story/2011-08-31/Ex-NHL-player-Wade-Belak-found-dead-in-Toronto/50208614/1\" rel=\"nofollow\">hockey enforcers that have been found dead</a> this past summer, perhaps EA can be forgiven for not wanting to make a big deal out of this.</p><p style=\"\">The on-ice presentation is tighter, too. EA hasn't quite reached the sort of indecipherable comparative broadcast quality that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1860\" href=\"/2k-sports/3010-1860/\" slug=\"2k-sports\">2K Sports</a> has with its <a data-ref-id=\"3025-498\" href=\"/nba-2k/3025-498/\" slug=\"nba-2k\">NBA</a> series, and the commentary is, by and large, pretty similar to last year's NHL game. That said, the overall tightness of that commentary, the addition of streak call-outs by the announcers, and other minor tweaks here and there make this one of the better attempts at a broadcast style of presentation EA has ever put together. It's certainly several cuts above <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33906\" href=\"/madden-nfl-12/3030-33906/\" slug=\"madden-nfl-12\">Madden</a>, to be sure.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Another thing NHL has always done much, much better than Madden is the notion of player creation. NHL's Be a Pro mode has typically been a shining beacon of how to do this kind of thing right, versus the relatively dull, passionless efforts of the Madden series. Changes to this year's mode are slight, but generally good. Mostly, the mode has been tweaked in such a way as to help avoid any moments of idling. You can opt to sim through any on-ice action not involving your created player, ensuring you don't sit around, waiting for the coach to call your number. The weird trade-off for that is that now, apparently all Be a Pro games are simulated to 20 minutes in real time (or, at least, I couldn't figure out how to change that setting in the game's admittedly sometimes befuddling, ill-explained interface), meaning you're still going to have to dedicate a fair amount of time to each game, especially if you're a top line player.</p><p style=\"\">Be a Pro also has something of an offshoot mode this year, a mode called \"Be a Legend\" where you can, for some reason, play as one of the great aged ones of hockey lore like <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89667\" href=\"/wayne-gretzky/3040-89667/\" slug=\"wayne-gretzky\">Wayne Gretzky</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-14058\" href=\"/mario-lemieux/3005-14058/\" slug=\"mario-lemieux\">Mario Lemieux,</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15730\" href=\"/jeremy-roenick/3005-15730/\" slug=\"jeremy-roenick\">Jeremy Roenick</a>. That's a fine idea in theory, except that the game opts to include these guys in the laziest way imaginable, essentially making them into Be a Pro defaults that can be plopped onto existing modern teams to \"see how they fare in the modern NHL.\" Guess what? Wayne Gretzky can still play hockey pretty well. Now that that mystery has been solved, can we maybe try a little harder next time? Again, one thing 2K Sports has always handled well is its treatment of classic players, including this year's NBA addition of full classic teams and rivalry match-ups. Hockey, more than any other sport, is as much about the play of the team's supporting players as it is its superstars. Full, classic rosters and rivalries would mean a hell of a lot more than seeing how Jeremy Roenick would fare as the top line center of the Minnesota Wild.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38151/1791831-229565_10150266626350996_333387460995_9438643_3176554_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791831\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"720\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38151/1791831-229565_10150266626350996_333387460995_9438643_3176554_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1791831\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38151/1791831-229565_10150266626350996_333387460995_9438643_3176554_n.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38151/1791831-229565_10150266626350996_333387460995_9438643_3176554_n.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Yep, that's as satisfying as it looks.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps I have overemphasized the importance of this feature in the grand scheme of things, but I only do so in absence of any other real mode or feature additions of value. The Winter Classic, the outdoor game that the NHL has done a very good job of convincing us all is the greatest thing to happen to the sport in the history of ever (it's cool, but <i>come on</i>) is finally included, though only last year's game at Heinz Field is here. Be a GM mode feels largely untouched from last year, warts and all. Yes, it's still lots of fun to manage your franchise, but it'd be great if <a data-ref-id=\"3010-69\" href=\"/ea-canada/3010-69/\" slug=\"ea-canada\">EA Canada</a> could take some time to finally bring this interface together into something that doesn't feel laborious when trying to manage the most base-level details of the team. Same goes for the online modes, which are almost a carbon copy of last year's selection, with only minimal tweaks to anything on offer. There is also the Ultimate Team mode, which is still the Ultimate Team mode. Into card-trading, random chance, and microtransactions? This is absolutely the mode for you.</p><p style=\"\">That's about the extent of the complaining I can reasonably muster toward NHL 12, however. It has its quirks, and certain areas certainly feel ignored compared with previous pushes forward in the series, but by and large, NHL 12 is a game that gets the details right in a way most sports games barely even aspire to. The on-ice action is tight, fast-paced, natural-feeling, and just a ton of fun, whether you're playing offline or on. If you need full-on revolution in your sports titles, NHL 12 might be a year to skip. If you just want a great-looking, and even better playing hockey game for the upcoming NHL season, NHL 12 has you covered.</p>", "deck": "The fundamentals of hockey are polished to a glistening sheen in this tightly focused, if not particularly revolutionary sequel.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-422/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33698/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nhl-12/3030-33698/", "id": 33698, "name": "NHL 12"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-09-21 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-113222/", "id": 113222, "name": "NHL 12"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/burnout-crash-review/1900-423/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1875924-burnoutcrashscreens1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1875924\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1875924-burnoutcrashscreens1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1875924\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1875924-burnoutcrashscreens1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Traffic circle of doom!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><span id=\"internal-source-marker_0.5068531734868884\"><a data-ref-id=\"3010-315\" href=\"/criterion-games/3010-315/\" slug=\"criterion-games\">Criterion Games</a> has spent the past decade perfecting the video game car crash with its smash-happy <a data-ref-id=\"3025-76\" href=\"/burnout/3025-76/\" slug=\"burnout\">Burnout</a> franchise--a series that, much like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-509\" href=\"/nascar/3025-509/\" slug=\"nascar\">NASCAR</a>, is ostensibly about racing, though everyone knows the real draw are the spectacular car crashes, explosively rendered in Burnout with an almost fetishistic care. Even when it\u2019s not the main focus of their attention, such as in last year\u2019s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31698\" href=\"/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/3030-31698/\" slug=\"need-for-speed-hot-pursuit\">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit</a>, Criterion has still been able to deliver satisfyingly crunchy car crashes. With this pedigree in mind, it\u2019s easy to see the potential of Burnout Crash, a downloadable title that retains most of the hallmark mechanics, yet strips clean the racing element, putting the focus squarely on creating as many charred chassis and as much twisted metal on the asphalt as possible. It\u2019s an idea that probably wouldn\u2019t carry a full-size game, yet seems like it could be a good fit for a downloadable title. So why does Burnout Crash feel so underwhelming?</span></p><p style=\"\">In part, it\u2019s because the game struggles with order and chaos, with gameplay that naturally favors pure pandemonium and a contrasting primary gameplay mode that demands nuance where mayhem is in chronically short supply. More fundamentally, though, it\u2019s because this is a trifle of a game, without much meaningful gameplay variety from beginning to end. That\u2019s not to say there aren\u2019t fleeting moments of fun, or that there\u2019s no skill to performing the perfect car crash. Once you\u2019ve cracked the code on how to approach an intersection and when to trigger subsequent explosions, though, it turns monotonous pretty quick, and the game\u2019s attempts to extend the experience with social hooks and bonus objectives ring hollow.</p><p style=\"\">The notion of forgoing any kind of racing pretext and just crashing the hell out of some cars isn\u2019t a new one, even for Burnout. Fans should remember the Crash Mode from pre-<a data-ref-id=\"3030-5648\" href=\"/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/\" slug=\"burnout-paradise\">Paradise</a> Burnout games, a dedicated mode where the player would hurtle into a busy intersection, smashing other vehicles and racking up as much damage as possible. As the cars pile up, your Crashbreaker meter starts to fill, and once it\u2019s charged, you can trigger another explosion with the intent of creating some high-value chain reactions of destruction. In a good run, you could pop the Crashbreaker multiple times, racking up millions of dollars in damage in the process. It\u2019s part <a data-ref-id=\"3045-83\" href=\"/pinball/3045-83/\" slug=\"pinball\">pinball</a>, part ad-hoc <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1820\" href=\"/rube-goldberg-puzzler/3015-1820/\" slug=\"rube-goldberg-puzzler\">Rube Goldberg</a> contraption, and all fiery explosions. That\u2019s the basis for Burnout Crash, which retains the significant Crash Mode mechanics, but switches the action to a top-down perspective, adds the ability to blow up buildings, and introduces a whole host of absurd special-effect vehicles and ridiculous game-ending events that serve to reinforce the whole pinball table vibe.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1875926-burnoutcrashscreens2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1875926\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1875926-burnoutcrashscreens2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1875926\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1875926-burnoutcrashscreens2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Welcome to Crash City: every driving instructor's nightmare.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As a cackling variant in a game already flush with burning rubber and shattered glass, Crash Mode was a fun distraction, but Criterion\u2019s attempts to flesh out the concept for Burnout Crash work against its strengths. There are three ways to play any of the intersections in Burnout Crash, though by default, you only have access to one of them, which wouldn\u2019t be a big deal if the default mode weren't the least compelling of the three. Called Road Trip, this mode features a set traffic pattern progression for each intersection, with special events like explosive gas trucks, tornadoes, meteor strikes, tidal waves, and, uh, lobster monsters appearing at specific crash milestones. All the while, though, you have to be incredibly vigilant and methodical about making sure that no cars make it out of the intersection alive, as the round will end immediately once five cars are allowed to pass through unmolested. Since your ability to move around the intersection is directly linked to your Crashbreaker ability, you have to exercise a lot of restraint, which comes at the direct expense of causing big, awesome explosions. It can be frustrating, particularly when you\u2019re sitting there with no Crashbreaker, helplessly watching traffic ride off into the sunset, and the rounds always feel like they go on for several minutes too long.</p><p style=\"\">Far more engaging is the Rush Hour mode, which ditches the five-strikes limit in favor of a 90-second timer, while also throwing way more traffic at you. It\u2019s more chaotic and less exacting, which makes more sense for both the underlying premise as well as the soft, limited controls you actually have. The Pile Up mode sort of splits the difference between Road Trip and Rush Hour, throwing a predefined number of cars at the intersection before entering a score-multiplied end-game sequence where your multiplier is defined by how many cars you let slip past. It\u2019s a structure that encourages you to try and catch all the traffic you can in the intersection without obliterating it completely until the score multiplier kicks in. It requires less precision than the Road Trip mode while rewarding your restraint with big crazy explosions at the end.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">There are 18 different intersections (read: levels) included in Burnout Crash, and though they often feature different road layouts and surrounding structures that can require a slightly different approach for maximum carnage, the experience doesn\u2019t really significantly evolve from beginning to end.

Sometimes for better (Runner), sometimes for worse (Void), all of the Bit.Trip games are very different, their common thread being a satisfying intersection of music and gameplay.

In this case, the player's musical participation has been largely abstracted. You're aware of the influence your actions are having on the music, but you're laser focused on dots. Lots and lots of dots.</p><p style=\"\">Bit.Trip games benefit from players having a sense of rhythm, but like music games where notes are coming down the screen, it's entirely possible to play these games strictly following patterns. I mean, does anyone really think the kids on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5070\" href=\"/youtube-integration/3015-5070/\" slug=\"youtube-integration\">YouTube</a> beating DragonForce songs are listening to the music?<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The major selling points of Bit.Trip Saga are having every Bit.Trip game in one place in a portable form and experiencing them in <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1204\" href=\"/stereoscopic-3d/3015-1204/\" slug=\"stereoscopic-3d\">3D</a>. The trippy, layered visuals rhythmically pounding over each Bit.Trip game <i>seem</i> natural for 3D, but whether that's a false assumption on my part or if Gaijin Games was simply unable to make it work, 3D is a non-starter here. Not only does the 3D fail to make much of an impression when switched on, in the case of games like Runner, the added effect is horribly detrimental to the frame rate. When the 3D is enabled, regardless of how far the slider's been pushed, the frame rate takes a big hit. In games where timing is everything, this is totally inexcusable, rendering 3D a worthless addition.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7003/1379052-screen_btr_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1379052\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54807692307692\" data-width=\"832\" style=\"width: 832px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7003/1379052-screen_btr_03.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1379052\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7003/1379052-screen_btr_03.png\"></a><figcaption>Runner is easily the highlight, sporting some excellent music.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Even with 3D flipped off, there were moments in Runner where apparently enough is happening to cause the frame rate to drop. I don't remember any frame rate hassles in the WiiWare version. It's truly a bummer, and an unfortunate blemish on a package that includes some truly terrific games known for visual flair.</p><p style=\"\">Elsewhere, the ports hold up. Pong-like Beat and Flux become much easier to play on 3DS, the former especially. Beat stages do not feature a single <a data-ref-id=\"3015-292\" href=\"/checkpoints/3015-292/\" slug=\"checkpoints\">checkpoint</a> (the series didn't <i>have</i> checkpoints until Flux), and the stylus allows for precise movement of the paddle across the screen. You can tap the stylus anywhere else on the screen and the paddle will jump there immediately. Compared to slowly rotating an <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" slug=\"iphone\">iPhone</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" slug=\"wii\">Wii</a> Remote, it's much more effective against the game's sadistic dot patterns. And don't even trying playing with the circle pad; it's far too sensitive and there are <i>zero</i> options to tweak it, another instance of this collection not getting the level of attention these games deserved. The others play as they should, just as god-damn-I-wanna-throw-my-3DS hard as I remember them.</p><p style=\"\">Visual issues aside, Bit.Trip Saga remains a pretty awesome set. Your other option is picking up <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35673\" href=\"/bittrip-complete/3030-35673/\" slug=\"bittrip-complete\">Bit.Trip Complete</a>, which also collects every game with new challenges. These games would set you back $42 on WiiWare, and it's $39.99 on 3DS. It's not the ultimate sendoff for what may very well be the end of the series, but another chance to put my fingers through the Runner gauntlet is worthwhile.</p>", "deck": "A collection of truly great games unfortunately marred by frame-rate-breaking 3D.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-424/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-34946/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bittrip-saga/3030-34946/", "id": 34946, "name": "Bit.Trip Saga"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-09-23 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-110300/", "id": 110300, "name": "Bit.Trip Saga"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/x-men-destiny-review/1900-425/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870734-x_men_destiny___adrian__juggernaut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870734\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870734-x_men_destiny___adrian__juggernaut.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870734\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1870734-x_men_destiny___adrian__juggernaut.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\"><span id=\"internal-source-marker_0.24412503838539124\">For comic book fans, there\u2019s really no shortage of listless, mercenary dreck like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32853\" href=\"/x-men-destiny/3030-32853/\" slug=\"x-men-destiny\">X-Men: Destiny</a>.

This is, more essentially, a beat-\u2019em-up game of limited dimension, populated with repetitious enemy fodder and driven by monotonous three-tap combat where the notion of player agency couldn\u2019t seem more superfluous.

The story continues on this way, tossing around third-string X-Men and springing clandestine plot twists with little explanation.

Beyond simple aesthetics, fostering a sense of consequence and allowing the player to approach the game with different abilities are two of the fundamentals of role-playing in video games, and X-Men: Destiny unilaterally fumbles both.</p><p style=\"\">While the character customization system lets you earn and cultivate a whole host of active and passive powers, many of your choices are redundant, and none of the wildest deviations have that fundamental an impact on how the game is played.

A century after the asteroid strike, you're a cybernetically enhanced member of that program who emerges to find a world that's been rebuilt out of scrap and duct tape, with various bandit clans controlling different parts of the wasteland, a few good-hearted folks trying to eke out a hard-scrabble existence in between, and a cliched, mechanized regime keeping oppressive watch over the whole thing.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969797-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.46.35_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969797\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56003223207091\" data-width=\"1241\" style=\"width: 1241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969797-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.46.35_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969797\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969797-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.46.35_pm_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's a staggering amount of detail packed into the game's environments.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's room even in a familiar premise like this to explore new dramatic ideas, but Rage plays it as straight as possible with its story elements. Every character wears his or her intentions on their sleeves, and there's only one minor wrinkle in the plot that seems like it might go somewhere interesting, but then only seems to set up a potential sequel. The voice cast, featuring <a data-ref-id=\"3040-3583\" href=\"/john-goodman/3040-3583/\" slug=\"john-goodman\">John Goodman</a> leading a legion of familiar-sounding voiceover pros, at least does an admirable job bringing character to the people you interact with, and even if the things they're saying are usually bare justification to get you to the next action stage, it's at least a joy to watch them say it. Every line of dialogue in the game has a unique animation routine attached to it; the characters gesticulate and emote with the kind of detail that suggests a bunch of animators poring over every dialogue recording and mimicking the final output in a mirror to get those subtle human movements just right. Oddly enough, that detail actually goes a long way toward bringing the world to life and drawing you in. It's a minor point, but it also helps that the small number of characters in each friendly town have a habit of moving around a lot between missions. You don't really notice how odd it is that most video game characters stand in the exact same spot for the duration of an entire game until you see them break free and actually go stand in a different place once in a while.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969798-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.42.27_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969798\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56129032258065\" data-width=\"1240\" style=\"width: 1240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969798-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.42.27_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969798\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969798-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.42.27_pm_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969798-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.42.27_pm_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Rage's driving combat is loose and fast-paced.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Anyway, aside from the initial setup, Rage is not Fallout. In fact, it's almost Fallout's direct opposite, strong in the areas where Fallout falters--fast action, lush visuals--and weak at doing what Fallout does well, which is character customization, exploration, and storytelling. You get the first hint of this the second you step out of your capsule and into the wasteland. Remember exiting <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1230\" href=\"/vault-101/3035-1230/\" slug=\"vault-101\">Vault 101</a> and slowly panning across the vast landscape, and all the potential for adventure it held? Here, you're not outside 30 seconds before John Goodman is shooting a mutant off of you and yelling at you to get in his buggy so he can whisk you away to your first proper mission. The game takes a similarly fast-paced, streamlined approach to the weapon lineup (essentially the same one you've come to expect from all id games) and the crafting and looting, which respectively have you building useful combat items out of the component parts that are useful, and selling all the junk that isn't. It's not a bad thing these systems are so simplified, it's just the focus of the game to keep things moving expediently from one action sequence to the next without leaving you bogged down in menus.</p><p style=\"\">Nearly all of id's games have <i>just</i> been shooters--run forward, blast everything that gets in your way, repeat in next level--and that sequence of events still forms the backbone of Rage. But instead of merely presenting a linear chain of levels joined end to end with loading screens, those levels are now connected more dynamically with a wasteland hub environment that you traverse in your <i>Mad Max</i>-style dilapidated vehicles. In between the story levels--which still roll out in one specific order--you can do some quick circuit races to earn upgrades for your cars, pick up some mercenary jobs from a bulletin board, or play a diverse little assortment of cash-generating minigames that includes a surprisingly complex, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-493\" href=\"/magic-the-gathering/3025-493/\" slug=\"magic-the-gathering\">Magic: The Gathering</a>-style card battler that ties into cards you collect throughout the game. Out in the wasteland, there's not much to discover outside of the places the main and side missions send you, though there's satisfying combat to be done with the local bandits, and there are a few trick jumps to hit here and there. Many, though not nearly all, of the side missions yield benefits like new item recipes that help flesh out the gameplay a bit.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969799-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.41.52_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969799\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56083803384367\" data-width=\"1241\" style=\"width: 1241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969799-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.41.52_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969799\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969799-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.41.52_pm_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969799-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.41.52_pm_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Would you believe the minigames are actually a lot of fun?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I'm glad these diversionary activities are there, because they're all just entertaining enough to cleanse your palate if you want a break from the shooting missions. But still, shooting stuff is your primary activity, so it's a good thing Rage's combat hits as hard as it does. Par for an id game, all the weapons have a heavy, powerful feel, made a lot more pronounced by the varied, over-the-top ways enemies react to getting hit by them. The game has some of the best <a data-ref-id=\"3015-118\" href=\"/ragdoll-physics/3015-118/\" slug=\"ragdoll-physics\">ragdoll physics</a> in recent memory; the spindly lesser mutants will flip head over heels from a squarely placed shotgun blast, while the human enemies will believably go flying over a rail or slam face first into a wall if you hit them right. It's all kind of silly, action-movie stuff that probably won't do much for you if you aren't in the mood for a traditional shooter, but if you are, it's immensely satisfying. I got a lot of entertainment value out of the combat since all the weapons have multiple ammo types that are especially effective in specific situations, and engineering items like stationary turrets, a spider robot straight out of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14537\" href=\"/doom-3/3030-14537/\" slug=\"doom-3\">Doom 3</a>, and the boomerang-like bladed wingstick give you a lot of options to play with. A lot of thought clearly went into the best interface to manage all of these weapons, ammo types, and gadgets. If I told you that you use both shoulder buttons, both analog sticks, and the d-pad to do so, you'd be justified in thinking it might be unwieldy. But it's actually quick and elegant. Most of the missions ultimately boil down to you shooting your way to the end of a map to hit a switch or pick up an item, but at least getting there is a lot of fun.</p><p style=\"\">It's good at what it does, but Rage isn't without flaws. It lacks a modern checkpoint system, and only creates an auto-save the last time you loaded into a level, meaning you'll replay an entire mission if you die without saving in the middle. You'll probably only get burned by that system once before you learn to start making hard saves frequently, but man is it frustrating when it happens. Some of the enemy groups are also kind of ridiculous. Each clan of bandits is composed of two or three of the exact same guy, and all of them use exactly one voice actor per group, so you get the same silly British or Russian accent coming from a big mass of enemies that all look the same. The game has the sensibilities of a comic book or, you know, a video game, so that's not really worth getting hung up on, but it stood out to me initially.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969800-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.51.12_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969800\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56083803384367\" data-width=\"1241\" style=\"width: 1241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969800-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.51.12_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969800\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969800-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.51.12_pm_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969800-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.51.12_pm_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alternate ammo types and engineering doohickeys give you a lot of combat options.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Even if Rage were the worst game to come out in a long while, it would still arguably be the best-looking one. The sheer complexity of texture and detail packed into every one of the game's environments is nothing short of staggering, especially in the two town hubs that you'll return to again and again between missions. The vast richness of the wasteland also can't be overstated. This is one of the best-looking games available on consoles, as good-looking as most any Unreal Engine game, yet it runs at double the frame rate of those games. Seeing a game on aging console hardware that looks this good <i>and</i> runs this smoothly is almost surreal. To be fair, in all three versions, there's a noticeable amount of detailed texture pop-in when you quickly look in different directions, but it's only something you really notice when you look for it and try to make it appear; it doesn't stand out much when you're playing the game like you normally would. Setting that one quirk aside, you really need to see this game in motion, in person, to appreciate just how good it actually looks.</p><p style=\"\">All three versions of the game have some sort of technical quirk, unfortunately. The 360 version looks better than the PS3 one and runs at a rock-solid 60 frames per second, but it ships on three discs and dropped me to the dashboard with an error every time I tried to swap them, requiring me to start the new disc back up and load a save to continue. The one-disc PS3 version suffers from a slightly lower (though still fully acceptable) frame rate at times, and the texture pop-in is slower and thus more prominent there. And, mindbogglingly, the PC version launched in a miserable state that rendered it unplayable on ATI cards, though a matter of hours later an emergency set of drivers seems to have things working fine on both brands of GPU. The PC version is naturally the sharpest one (though I saw an inordinate amount of tearing on our office PC setup), and it plays fine with the good old keyboard and mouse, though it's a testament to how good the console versions look and how well they play on a gamepad that the PC version is only marginally better in general.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969801-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.49.42_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969801\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56003223207091\" data-width=\"1241\" style=\"width: 1241px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1969801-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.49.42_pm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969801\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969801-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.49.42_pm_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1969801-screen_shot_2011_10_04_at_5.49.42_pm_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Seriously, just look at this game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You'll probably spend between 10 and 15 hours on the campaign here if you try to do everything there is to do; I ended up on the high end of that range due to obsessively looking for collectibles and, honestly, gawking repeatedly at how damn pretty everything is. There's also a decent two-player co-op mode that mostly repurposes levels from the story mode but changes the enemy distribution and tries to give the missions some context by couching them in light back story from the main game. (One mission tells how three giant stuffed mutant heads came to adorn the wall of the local watering hole, for instance.) There's also a four-player driving mode with a variety of objectives that lets you rank up and unlock new weapons and better cars. Though I had a good time with the driving combat in the campaign, I didn't have much desire to keep doing it against human players, so I didn't spend much time there. The co-op is a bigger draw, at least until you play through the handful of missions available.</p><p style=\"\">Over the first couple of hours, you may find yourself coming to terms with the style of game Rage actually is, rather than the type of game you may have expected it to be based on some of its peripheral design elements. A deep and sprawling experience it's not, but as a focused, directed shooter with a few other things to do between the shooting, it hits the right notes. And damn does it look good doing it.</p>", "deck": "Rage won't set new standards for game design, but if you want to drive and shoot in an incredible-looking wasteland, this is your game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-426/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PC, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20672/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/rage/3030-20672/", "id": 20672, "name": "Rage"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-10-04 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-96872/", "id": 96872, "name": "Rage"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/forza-motorsport-4-review/1900-427/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64290/1966030-getphoto.ashx118sxne.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1966030\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/64290/1966030-getphoto.ashx118sxne.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1966030\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/64290/1966030-getphoto.ashx118sxne.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Autovista mode lets you see some nicely detailed car models and cockpits.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-33400\" href=\"/forza-motorsport-4/3030-33400/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport-4\">Forza Motorsport 4</a> doesn't reinvent the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-199\" href=\"/forza-motorsport/3025-199/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport\">Forza franchise</a>, and given the exceedingly high quality of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24995\" href=\"/forza-motorsport-3/3030-24995/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport-3\">Forza 3</a>, it'd be insane to expect dramatic changes from the sequel. Some new features have slid into place around its periphery, but this is still the same accessible, configurable, and wonderful driving game that it was in 2009. How that bit of info strikes you will largely depend on your feelings about the previous game. The quality and depth offered is practically indisputable--but if you left Forza 3 feeling like you've had your fill, Forza 4's new additions probably aren't going to be enough to make it all feel fresh and exciting.</p><p style=\"\">The structure of Forza 4's career mode has changed on the surface to form a world tour mode. When playing the world tour, the game moves you from one track to the next, presenting multiple events for each track once you get there based on the cars you currently possess. So if you're sitting in a Mazda MX-5 Gen 1, you might get offered a slower E-class race or an event built specifically for Mazda MX-5's. Hop into a 2009 Dodge Challenger and you might see something like the Charger &amp; Challenger Club event, built specifically for those two models to face off. Upgrading your cars also impacts the events you'll see, since plenty of events are built around which class your car is currently in. While this automatically takes you around the game, the world tour is essentially just a guided way to check off boxes on the game's huge event list, where hundreds of different races await. If you'd rather select your own events, the list is available to you at any time.</p><p style=\"\">Forza 4 has an additional Rivals mode, which is a leaderboard-and-ghost focused option that lets you load in the replays of your friends, car club members, or if none of those people have tried the event, you can grab the ghost of a player you don't know. The events, some of which will rotate on a monthly basis, span a lot of different race styles, like simple lap times on empty tracks, full-on races, driving on tracks littered with slow-moving traffic, drift events that score you based on how awesome your drifting is, and so on.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67447/1909437-getphoto_95_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909437\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67447/1909437-getphoto_95_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909437\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67447/1909437-getphoto_95_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It's easy to spend hours just sifting through the storefronts and finding amazing vinyl groups.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Regardless of how you play, after each race you'll earn some amount of driver experience points, credits, and manufacturer affinity points. Driver XP gives you a free car every time you level up. Credits are used to, you know, buy stuff, like cars, vinyl designs, tuning setups, and parts to upgrade your car. But if you can hold off on buying parts for your cars until you clear a few levels of manufacturer affinity, the prices on parts drop lower and lower, eventually becoming free. It'll only take a few races to hit that 100% discount, so it's worth it to stick to one brand of car for a bit, especially at the beginning of the game, where money is harder to come by. If you're impatient (or just plain crazy), you can also buy \"car tokens\" with <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5685\" href=\"/microsoft-points/3015-5685/\" slug=\"microsoft-points\">Microsoft Points</a> and exchange a few of those for any car in the catalog. But the world tour will focus your career on a reasonably gentle speed slope and when you're playing online you get access to a lot of cars for free, so that doesn't necessarily make a whole lot of financial sense.</p><p style=\"\">Online, you can get up to 16 players into a lobby and roll through a ton of different options to configure events to your liking. The basic race types are available, but you can also go custom and create your own weird variants with different types of scoring, team settings, and the like. You can lock out specific car classes or even force everyone in your lobby to use a specific camera setting. And if you're anticipating troublemakers, you can even disable on-track collisions, making the game more of a group time trial than a traditional race. Considering the way this all went down in previous Forza games, turning off collisions might not be the worst idea, as boorish random players seem to always want to bump their way into first place or fly into corners at full speed, using the other racers as cushions to help them make turns, and what have you. If that's how you want to play, fine, but if you're attempting to behave in a civilized fashion, you might want to team up with some likeminded individuals ahead of time. That's where the game's car club feature fits in, letting you build your own racing teams online and struggle on club leaderboards. You can also share cars in your club, letting players pool their resources and build a great, versatile online garage.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Customization has been a huge part of the Forza franchise and it returns intact in Forza 4. You can paint on your cars using primitive shapes, which can result in some startlingly detailed designs. Also, if you bought or made a lot of layer groups in Forza 3, they'll import right into the new game. I'll never be able to put together anything cooler than a bad-looking pixelated <a data-ref-id=\"3025-343\" href=\"/space-invaders/3025-343/\" slug=\"space-invaders\">Space Invader</a>, but a quick search of the game's storefronts turns up all sorts of amazing decal work. Tuning setups and full car designs can also be placed up for sale on a user's storefront, creating a fun little economy that keeps the in-game credits moving around. If you're looking for a new car at a possible discount, there's an auction house that, once again, lets you find all sorts of stuff, including the ultra-rare \"Unicorn\" cars, which get their own tab in the auction house.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67447/1909417-getphoto_339_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909417\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67447/1909417-getphoto_339_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909417\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67447/1909417-getphoto_339_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67447/1909417-getphoto_339_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Top Gear test track offers some quick bowling events.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There are a lot of different ways to play Forza Motorsport 4, and it's tunable enough to let players of any skill level get something out of it. With all of the assists turned on, the game practically plays itself, and all you really need to do is follow the on-screen driving line and occasionally pass the AI racers. But that quickly gets boring. Once you start reducing the assistance level to put more of the car into your hands, the game becomes a lot more exciting. But if you can't handle every single turn by yourself, the game again has a rewind feature that lets you roll back the action when playing by yourself to undo mistakes. This has an impact on how your score enters the leaderboards, but that isn't the end of the world. There are also different control options, with wheel support--including support for the new Wireless Speed Wheel, a goofy little flight yoke sort of controller that's great if you only want to play games that feel like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20645\" href=\"/mario-kart-wii/3030-20645/\" slug=\"mario-kart-wii\">Mario Kart Wii</a> did when you slapped the Wii Remote into the center of that plastic steering wheel attachment. It works as advertised, but doesn't feel like a great way to play the game for long periods of time.</p><p style=\"\">Forza 4 also has <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\" href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" slug=\"kinect-support\">Kinect support</a> in a few of its modes. You can't drive with Kinect in career mode, though. Instead, starting the game with Kinect takes you to a separate menu where you can set up quick, mostly meaningless races or time trials. Steering with Kinect is as simple as holding your arms up in front of you, sort of like Kinect Joyride, though you can drive sitting down, if you like. You don't have any control over your acceleration or braking when playing with Kinect--all you do is steer. As you might imagine, that isn't fun for very long, though perhaps very young children might get a kick out of it. You can use the Kinect camera along with a controller or racing wheel by enabling head tracking. This tilts your view as you move your head from side to side, which feels like a pretty superfluous addition.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67447/1909426-getphoto_30_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909426\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67447/1909426-getphoto_30_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909426\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67447/1909426-getphoto_30_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67447/1909426-getphoto_30_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>GET LOOSE</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You can also use Kinect to \"walk\" around cars and explore them in the new Autovista mode. You can also do this with a controller, and the experience isn't markedly different either way. This isn't really gameplay, it's more like visiting a virtual car museum and taking a tour of some of the game's rarest, most interesting vehicles. As you pop the hood and get up for a closer look at the engine or wheels, specific points on the car pop out and offer a spoken description of that section. You can also get an overview of each Autovista car from <i>Top Gear</i>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3040-100688\" href=\"/jeremy-clarkson/3040-100688/\" slug=\"jeremy-clarkson\">Jeremy Clarkson</a>. I can't imagine anyone spending a lot of time leaning their way around these different car models to hear every single bit of detail. Mostly, it's an interesting feature to try two or three times, and then maybe one or two more times if you're showing the game off to someone else. Maybe if you're an absolute car fiend you'll really want to devour all this information?</p><p style=\"\">It's still a beautiful game and it's probably the world's best driving simulator, at least for consoles, but a lot of Forza 4's changes feel incremental at best. The game includes many of the same tracks found in previous installments, and I found myself getting a very \"annual sports game update\" vibe off of it. With that in mind, it seems like the game's most die-hard fans and people who didn't play the previous Forza will get the most out of Forza 4. It's easy to see that Forza 4 is a great game, but after playing hours of Forza 3 back when it was fresh, it was hard for me to get as much out of Forza 4's largely similar offering.</p>", "deck": "Forza Motorsport 4 is a fantastic driving game, but the improvements over Forza 3 feel pretty incremental.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-427/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33400/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/forza-motorsport-4/3030-33400/", "id": 33400, "name": "Forza Motorsport 4"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-10-07 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-113692/", "id": 113692, "name": "Forza Motorsport 4"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dead-rising-2-off-the-record-review/1900-428/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1814299-2132450677_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814299\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5630081300813\" data-width=\"984\" style=\"width: 984px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1814299-2132450677_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814299\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39947/1814299-2132450677_full.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Frank West, ladies and gentlemen.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-34778\" href=\"/dead-rising-2-off-the-record/3030-34778/\" slug=\"dead-rising-2-off-the-record\">Dead Rising 2: Off the Record</a> makes enough meaningful improvements and additions to the formula of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a>'s hectic, quirky zombie action series that it's easy to call this game the best <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1218\" href=\"/dead-rising/3025-1218/\" slug=\"dead-rising\">Dead Rising</a> to date. So it might sound odd to say that there's also a good chance you should skip this game entirely. Off the Record is billed as a sort of alternate-history version of Dead Rising 2 that replaces the previous hero, the noble but downtrodden motocross star <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12914\" href=\"/chuck-greene/3005-12914/\" slug=\"chuck-greene\">Chuck Greene</a>, with the series' original protagonist, the sleazy but downtrodden photojournalist <a data-ref-id=\"3005-715\" href=\"/frank-west/3005-715/\" slug=\"frank-west\">Frank West</a>. That idea has merit, but it's hard not to be disappointed by the sheer amount of content in this package that's lifted directly from the last game.</p><p style=\"\">Of course, it will only seem recycled to you if you played through Dead Rising 2. I should state upfront that if you missed that game, and you're down for more of the bizarre humor, time-limited mission structure, and mass <a data-ref-id=\"3015-79\" href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" slug=\"zombie\">zombie</a> slaughter this series offers, Off the Record is a great deal at $40, since it has everything in the original along with some nice extras. But that's also the problem with this game. The core storyline of Dead Rising 2, which involves a 72-hour zombie outbreak in the Vegas-like pleasure-dome of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2780\" href=\"/fortune-city/3035-2780/\" slug=\"fortune-city\">Fortune City</a>, remains basically unchanged. A few of the characters' roles in the story are slightly different, and enough of the dialog has been rerecorded to integrate Frank seamlessly into the starring role, but by and large the story beats and even specific cutscenes usually range from slightly modified to essentially identical. As someone who for some baffling reason put at least 25 hours into Dead Rising 2, it was hard to shake the feeling that I'd seen all of this before, and even when things start to diverge a bit later in the game, it all feels too much like a retread. This game would stand more readily on its own if it offered a more unique story for Frank to make his way through.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1872239-dead_rising_2_off_the_record_playstation_3_ps3_1314384918_027.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872239\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1872239-dead_rising_2_off_the_record_playstation_3_ps3_1314384918_027.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872239\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1872239-dead_rising_2_off_the_record_playstation_3_ps3_1314384918_027.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Same zombies, same city, different guy.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That's not to say there isn't <i>some</i> new content here, even for returning players. A new theme park area has been grafted onto Fortune City that offers some silly carnival games and other ridiculous ways to kill zombies. Some of the collectible items like magazines have been moved around a bit, and a good number of the survivor side missions are also now in different places (though they're the same otherwise). And there's a handful of amusing new combo weapons to put together, but then, none of them are as consistently useful as old standbys like the nail bat and knife gloves. And of course, Frank still has his trusty camera, so you can earn extra experience points taking pictures of all the brutal, dramatic, and erotic sights a zombie-infested Fortune City has to offer. Even the DLC costumes from the first game are included on the disc. It's nice that this stuff is in here, but it's not nearly enough to offset how familiar the story progression and core missions are.</p><p style=\"\">Some of the most meaningful additions in Off the Record are actually the ones that take place under the hood. Dead Rising 2 already offered three save slots (up from the original game's one), so you could stagger your save games and roll back to an earlier save if you locked yourself into a spot where you didn't have time to finish the next case file. Off the Record adds checkpoints to this system that trigger when you enter a new area or after you complete major objectives. The checkpoints act as a great safety net that prevents you from losing too much progress if haven't made a hard save in a while, and you happen to unexpectedly die or wander into a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1763\" href=\"/psychopaths/3015-1763/\" slug=\"psychopaths\">psychopath</a> battle without being prepared. It's a minor point, but you can now also drop waypoints anywhere on the map, making it easier to find your way around to specific locations.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1872240-dead_rising_2_off_the_record_playstation_3_ps3_1314384918_028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872240\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1872240-dead_rising_2_off_the_record_playstation_3_ps3_1314384918_028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1872240\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1872240-dead_rising_2_off_the_record_playstation_3_ps3_1314384918_028.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1872240-dead_rising_2_off_the_record_playstation_3_ps3_1314384918_028.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The sandbox mode is a great way to earn experience and mess around without any time pressure.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Finally (and I do mean finally), Off the Record has a sandbox mode that lets you roam the whole of Fortune City with no time limit. There are dozens of challenge missions scattered around the map that have you killing a quota of zombies in a specific way, or racing to a destination in a set amount of time, and so on. These objectives are amplified if you bring a second player in for co-op, and both versions of each mission have a leaderboard attached. Or you could forget about the missions entirely and just go nuts building weapons, killing zombies, and generally messing around. The best thing about the sandbox mode is that all of the experience points, cash, and even collectible things like combo cards that you earn there will transfer right back into the story mode. If you're the type of person who likes to level up your character for more health and inventory space before you really get going through the story, the sandbox offers you a good way to do that without playing the first couple of hours of the game multiple times ad nauseam. Alas, each mission has to be unlocked with a minimum number of zombie kills, so I found myself having to grind out a bunch of kills after I finished each mission, before I was able to take on the next one. That's an unfortunate limitation that slows down your enjoyment of the sandbox mode, but then it wouldn't be Dead Rising without the mechanics arbitrarily impeding your progress once in a while.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1814304-2132450681_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814304\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5630081300813\" data-width=\"984\" style=\"width: 984px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39947/1814304-2132450681_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1814304\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39947/1814304-2132450681_full.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39947/1814304-2132450681_full.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Obligatory shot of new area.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Since the vast majority of the assets here are straight from Dead Rising 2, this game looks almost exactly like that one did, so it's no surprise that the PC version is once again the best one, with a smoother frame rate and faster load times on a modern system (not to mention Xbox Live achievements, if you're into that sort of thing). But at least the console version's awful load times have been noticeably improved from before. That's some consolation when you lead survivors back to the safe room, but it's a shame the developers didn't go further and allow you to just drop them off at the entrance, without making you load into and back out of the safe room at all. Unlike the load times, the performance sadly isn't really improved on console, with the frame rate bogging down pretty badly in open areas with a lot of zombies. It's especially atrocious in that new theme park (cheekily dubbed the Uranus Zone). You'd think there would be more polish applied to the game's one completely new area, but the opposite is true.</p><p style=\"\">Off the Record strikes me as a strange product. There are a lot of reasons to fondly remember Frank West, and it's fun to see him back in action here, even if he's put on a few. But the way this game depicts Frank going through nearly the same story you've seen before sort of cheapens the existence of the original Dead Rising 2. Video games are such a blatantly sequel-driven medium that I'm genuinely impressed any time a franchise makes a move as bold as replacing its protagonist, and moreover, Chuck Greene was a likable guy who did a respectable job with the whole reluctant-hero thing. Off the Record almost feels like it's giving up and saying, \"OK, fine, here's that original guy you were so attached to.\" What this game means for a possible third Dead Rising remains to be seen, but at present, your interest in Off the Record should be directly dictated by how much Dead Rising 2 you've already played, and how much more you're still eager to play now.</p>", "deck": "In some important ways, Off the Record is the best Dead Rising yet.

The NBA season is already delayed, games have been canceled, and in all likelihood, we won't even get a season this year. To that, I say to hell with it all. Real basketball, dramatic as it can be, is filled to the brim with egotistical players, coaches, and owners who bicker endlessly about the direction of a league that can best be compared to the Titanic. Top heavy with talent and encumbered with too many teams, the NBA as it currently exists feels more or less doomed, fated to crash into a David Stern-shaped iceberg the likes of which it cannot possibly recover. Even if it does come back this year, some big changes will have to happen to keep this boat afloat. Frankly, I think the league would be better off sinking, and dredged for salvage parts next year.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18034/1892248-nba_xenon_0847.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1892248\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18034/1892248-nba_xenon_0847.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1892248\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18034/1892248-nba_xenon_0847.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Posting up has never felt better.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I say this with such reckless fervor because of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35564\" href=\"/nba-2k12/3030-35564/\" slug=\"nba-2k12\">NBA 2K12</a>. Without context, that might sound insane, but understand what I mean. With NBA 2K12, a game I can say without even the slightest hint of doubt or discomfort is the best basketball simulation I've ever played, I am constantly reminded of the qualities of the sport of basketball that I fell in love with so many years ago. The athleticism, the flair, the sheer thrill of the game is on display in such tightly constructed, beautifully playable form, that in a weird way, I honestly don't care if there even is an NBA season. The sheer volume of content <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1860\" href=\"/2k-sports/3010-1860/\" slug=\"2k-sports\">2K Sports</a> has included, alongside some of the best pure gameplay you're ever going to find in a sports title, make me forget about all the bitching and bickering of the real life NBA, and bring me back to the essence of what makes the sport so great at its core.</p><p style=\"\">Granted, if you played last year's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31439\" href=\"/nba-2k11/3030-31439/\" slug=\"nba-2k11\">NBA 2K11</a>, the gameplay side of things won't feel wildly different. 2K made huge strides in the last couple of iterations, and this year the tweaks are more subtle, albeit still fantastic. The biggest difference you'll notice is in the post game. Posting up in the paint was always a bit of an awkward situation in NBA 2K games, but here it's been improved drastically. Just tapping the Y/Triangle button puts your player into his post stance, and from there, you can choose from a variety of different, dynamic shots, as opposed to having the computer pick one for you. Defense in the post game is more dynamic now too, but you'll notice the changes more on offense. Whereas before you once felt governed by canned animations, now you can move with greater fluidity and control.</p><p style=\"\">The opponent AI also feels different this time around. 2K11 had moments where you were quite certain the computer had simply decided it was going to win this game and began tossing up crazy alley oops and bizarre passes that seemed completely preordained. While 2K12 occasionally dabbles in this sort of thing, it's far less frequent. When opposing teams go on scoring runs, there isn't often the sense that the computer is suddenly unstoppable. If you lock down your D and play tight, you will be able to get the W.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18034/1917413-lebronhotzones.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1917413\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18034/1917413-lebronhotzones.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1917413\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18034/1917413-lebronhotzones.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Training up your player is actually a lot of fun. The minigames are surprisingly a blast.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Otherwise, this is very much the same amazing game of basketball you've played before. The big difference is that now there are many more ways in which to do it.</p><p style=\"\">Chief among them is the newly upgraded My Player mode. Sports games have been flirting with this idea of creating a total, all-encompassing experience of following a player's career from draft day to retirement, with all the endorsements, controversies, and championships such a thing would (hopefully) entail. Among them, the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-590\" href=\"/nhl/3025-590/\" slug=\"nhl\">NHL</a> series has perhaps gotten closest to actually achieving this idea--at least until now. Without question, NBA 2K12's My Player mode creates the most engrossing version of a unique player identity anyone has attempted thus far. While character customization options are maybe a tad limited, the sheer breadth of events and actions around that character are anything but.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">You begin with a quick pre-draft exhibition game with other top rookies, aiming to showcase your talents to prospective teams. That's followed up by some post-game interviews with interested teams, who gauge your interest in playing for them with insanely detailed questions. 2K knows the NBA, and knows the makeup of the league. When the Wizards interview your prospective point guard, they're frank about the fact that they already have their point guard of the future in John Wall, and are mainly looking at you as a depth player. How you answer these questions affects both your draft status, and your own persona.</p><p style=\"\">That's the really interesting thing about My Player: you actually <i>have</i> a persona. The mode is far more than a series of sometimes incoherent menus that feed you statistical data and let you sim to the parts where your player actually gets on the court. The mode includes tons of great ways to keep you playing, from a teammate rating that goes up and down depending on how you perform on the court, to a series of drills designed to help you upgrade your stats (that must be performed in between paychecks), and even post-game press conferences, where your answers to reporters' questions will affect your chemistry with your teammates, as well as your standing throughout the league, and with your local fans.</p><p style=\"\">You can also play a version of this mode using any player in the league, be he superstar or scrub. However, it's way more interesting to craft your own superstar and put him through the paces of the league. If you want to be a diva, demanding trades and generally invoking the wrath of the fans for financial gain, you can do so. If you're a total team player that doesn't mind giving up minutes for a solid sixth-man status, you can do that too. It's detailed in all the right ways, and feels far less sterile than nearly all other attempts to do anything like this.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18034/1917418-sunscamera.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1917418\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18034/1917418-sunscamera.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1917418\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18034/1917418-sunscamera.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18034/1917418-sunscamera.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>On the court, NBA 2K has never looked more authentic than it does this year.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Sterility is simply not something you could accuse NBA 2K12 of in any facet of its game. Unsurprisingly, it looks great, animates brilliantly, and with the broadcast camera turned on, looks as close to a real game of basketball as you could possibly hope for with polygonal players. Even better is the commentary, a feature so often treated as a cheap bullet point by other developers, is given an almost absurd amount of tender loving care here. The addition of Steve Kerr as a third commentator is a welcome one, as he adds a nice boost to the flow of the dialogue and actually offers up some informative tidbits as games go along. More impressive, however, is just how tight it all feels. When a player throws down a massive dunk, or hits an insane three-pointer, the commentary stops dead in its tracks to react, making a big point to highlight what has just transpired. Then, in most cases, the commentators will actively pick back up where they left off, transitioning naturally to their previous exchange. I don't know how 2K's editors managed to edit all this together without it sounding like a herky-jerky nightmare, but they did it.</p><p style=\"\">The commentators are especially informative in the new NBA's Greatest mode. Building off the good feelings earned from the inclusion of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6213\" href=\"/michael-jordan/3005-6213/\" slug=\"michael-jordan\">Michael Jordan</a> in last year's game, 2K went kinda nuts this year, including 30 classic teams (as well as a couple of pre-order bonus teams) from 15 noteworthy rivalries and feuds from the many years of NBA history. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6541\" href=\"/bill-russell/3005-6541/\" slug=\"bill-russell\">Bill Russell's</a> Celtics, Michael Jordan's Bulls, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6543\" href=\"/magic-johnson/3005-6543/\" slug=\"magic-johnson\">Magic Johnson's</a> Lakers, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6538\" href=\"/julius-erving/3005-6538/\" slug=\"julius-erving\">Dr. J's</a> 76ers are among the many options here. Even better, the full rosters for both teams are included, so when you take <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6542\" href=\"/larry-bird/3005-6542/\" slug=\"larry-bird\">Larry Bird's</a> Celtics into battle against the Atlanta Hawks, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6551\" href=\"/dominique-wilkins/3005-6551/\" slug=\"dominique-wilkins\">Dominique Wilkins</a> and crew are all there to fight back as they should be.</p><p style=\"\">During these match-ups, the commentary team delivers ample history as well as play-by-play, outlining the historical significance of the rivalries and the players involved. It's a great, dynamic history lesson for anyone whose basketball knowledge doesn't extend beyond the day Lebron James got drafted. These sequences are also presented with correct rulesets, and visual filters meant to represent classic broadcasts. '60s games are in straight up black and white, while each successive decade moves from washed-out color to increasingly crisp picture.</p><p style=\"\">Regrettably, the legendary teams aren't available online, presumably because the '85-'86 Celtics would just destroy everyone. However, you can take the Association mode--NBA 2K's version of the franchise mode--online this year for the first time, with up to 29 other friends.

Be it lag, connection drops, or whatever other manner of weird glitch, something in this game's netcode has been infected by angry, malicious goblins who hate basketball and/or you. NBA 2K12 is, at best, a slight improvement on this. Save for a couple of connection drops, I mostly found myself unblocked when attempting to get into games. However, in a game this focused on well-timed shots and ball-handling, any amount of lag is a real problem. And there is most definitely still <i>any</i> amount of lag. I played in one game that felt close to the offline experience, and that player ended up dropping halfway through. I don't know if it was on purpose, but I'm presuming not, since I was down 15 at the half.</p><p style=\"\">Were it not for the online issues, NBA 2K12 would be the closest thing to a \"perfect\" video game basketball experience we have yet come to. In fact, it still probably is. This is one of those rare sports games where the offline content nearly made me forget about the online component. There is just so much to do, see, and mess around with, that I almost forgot playing online was even an option. NBA 2K12 is an easy game to lose one's self in, a perfect remedy for the NBA-lockout blues. Let the players and the owners haggle over profit splits and broken contract systems. With NBA 2K12 around, you'll hardly even miss the real thing.</p>", "deck": "2K's latest hoops simulator isn't without issue, but those few problems barely register compared with the sheer volume of incredible content contained within this package.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-429/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35564/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/nba-2k12/3030-35564/", "id": 35564, "name": "NBA 2K12"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2011-10-14 07:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-113340/", "id": 113340, "name": "NBA 2K12"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/spider-man-edge-of-time-review/1900-430/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870700-spider_man_eotpax01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870700\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5640625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870700-spider_man_eotpax01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870700\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1870700-spider_man_eotpax01.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\"><span id=\"internal-source-marker_0.4149615140631795\">There have been plenty of highs and lows for <a data-ref-id=\"3025-576\" href=\"/spider-man/3025-576/\" slug=\"spider-man\">Spider-Man</a> video games over the past decade-plus that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a> has held the license.

It\u2019s a Spider-Man team-up where Spider-Man is inessential to much of the experience, and it's not hard to imagine an alternate reality where Edge of Time doesn\u2019t feature <i>any</i> Spider-Men.</p><p style=\"\">It all starts when the clearly evil CEO of the clearly evil conglomerate Alchemex--voiced by a clearly phoning-it-in <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89951\" href=\"/val-kilmer/3040-89951/\" slug=\"val-kilmer\">Val Kilmer</a>--travels back from the year 2099 to the late 1970s to jump start the dastardly company's rise to power, affecting the realities of both present-day webslinger Peter Parker and his 2099 counterpart Miguel O'Hara in the process. Tapping into some ill-explained 2099 tech, O'Hara is able to communicate across time with the time-distorted Parker--now an Alchemex employee, though the rest of his reality as Spider-Man is inexplicably unchanged--and the two proceed to do what they can in their respective time frames to reverse the damage.

It's just as easy to introduce overly complicated logic as it is to whitewash any paradoxical dead-ends you might find yourself in, and Edge of Time manages to fall victim to both pitfalls. The idea of a character\u2019s actions in one timeframe having an instant impact on the reality of another is promising, particularly from a gameplay perspective, but all of those turns in the story here are completely pre-scripted, eliminating any sense of player agency in how things unfold. Even Spider-Man himself vocalizes his concerns about the dubious \u201cquantum causality\u201d effect that Edge of Time uses as a lazy catch-all whenever it needs a new obstacle for its heroes.</p><p style=\"\">In the game\u2019s earliest example, Spider-Man 2099 is faced with a giant robot he has no hope of defeating, so Amazing Spider-Man dismantles the giant robot before it can even be finished. Everyone involved, including both Spider-Men, assume this will erase the robot from existence, but instead, it\u2019s replaced with a similarly marauding gang of smaller robots. It\u2019s the first sign of many that \u201cquantum causality\u201d is just a paper-thin way of saying \u201crandom things happen because the writer wanted them to.\u201d The timeline might not be linear, but your path through the game most certainly is.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Narrative clarity isn\u2019t helped by the fact that both characters are traipsing around the same drab building for the whole damn game. Even if the game didn\u2019t deliberately revisit certain interiors, which it does frequently, there\u2019s never a terrific sense of place in Edge of Time, just one dark, vaguely high-tech room after another. Other than a single, relatively open-air greenhouse environment, this game takes place mostly within narrow corridors, which, in addition to adding to the monotony, really marginalizes Spider-Man\u2019s web-swinging ability. Flinging Spider-Man through wide-open spaces has been one of the greatest pleasures of past Spider-Man games for me, and the risky, improvisational feel of his particular style of traversal can represent a great shorthand for the character\u2019s persona. Here, the traversal feels clumsy and cramped, and the game ultimately leans on its beat-\u2019em-up combat for its five-or-so hours more than anything else.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870702-spider_man_eotpax03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870702\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5640625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870702-spider_man_eotpax03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870702\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1870702-spider_man_eotpax03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1870702-spider_man_eotpax03.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">So, you go back and forth between playing as Parker and O\u2019Hara as the story sees fit, bashing squads of jackboot thugs or faceless robots, respectively. Both Spider-Men share a number of fundamental abilities, and even though the game tries to differentiate them with unique skill trees, the practical differences in combat feel pretty negligible. The key exceptions are the free-fall sections that are played exclusively with Spider-Man 2099, which themselves rely on too much trial-and-error to provide particularly satisfying respite from the repetitive and mashy combat. In a better game, Edge of Time\u2019s in-line combat and the traversal challenges that pop up during the game (and which are easily revisited after the fact) could be a compelling reason to come back for more, but this game already overstays its welcome as it is.</p><p style=\"\">I suppose some slack should be given to developer Beenox, which had roughly a year to turn around from its last Spider-Man game. But that\u2019s not really material to the player, who is expecting, if not a great game, at least a great Spider-Man experience.

Instead of just competing with (and crushing) all of the other licensed games that we wade through on an annual basis, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29443\" href=\"/batman-arkham-city/3030-29443/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-city\">Batman: Arkham City</a> is the follow-up to an inventive and often-amazing Game of the Year contender. In the face of whatever pressure that creates, Arkham City doubles down on what worked in the previous game. This isn't a dramatic reimagining of the things that made <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-asylum\">Arkham Asylum</a> so great. Instead, it expands the scope a bit by giving you a larger area to explore and enhances the things that worked previously, giving you new combat options to toy around with while you get to the bottom of a pretty exciting story.</p><p style=\"\">The story starts with a bang, but doesn't really do much to set up the current state of the world. How, for example, did anyone buy into the idea of walling off a large part of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-111\" href=\"/gotham-city/3035-111/\" slug=\"gotham-city\">Gotham City</a> and turning it into a mega-prison? And who the hell signed off on putting <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16295\" href=\"/hugo-strange/3005-16295/\" slug=\"hugo-strange\">Hugo Strange</a> in charge? These are things that are explained in a bit more detail as you proceed, and as Batman, you'll need to make your way through this prison full of super villains. Some of these guys, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5818\" href=\"/the-penguin/3005-5818/\" slug=\"the-penguin\">Penguin</a> or the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-952\" href=\"/the-joker/3005-952/\" slug=\"the-joker\">Joker</a>, are major thorns in your side for large parts of the game. But as in the previous Arkham release, there are plenty of villains making what amount to cameo appearances via the game's side missions. Some of the side mission arcs--like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2948\" href=\"/the-riddler/3005-2948/\" slug=\"the-riddler\">The Riddler</a>'s--will probably take more time than completing the main story does. But others, like finding a gadget upgrade that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5866\" href=\"/mr-freeze/3005-5866/\" slug=\"mr-freeze\">Mr. Freeze</a> left lying around in the Steel Mill, get checked off almost immediately. The game's map and mission screen is well-designed, which makes keeping track of all that stuff nice and easy.</p><p style=\"\">There are plenty of things to do and see in Arkham City, but the main story missions are just as linear as the previous game's were. You aren't presented with a multitude of primary tasks that you can complete in any order. Instead, the story has you move from one location to the next, with great-looking cutscenes breaking up the action. A deadly sickness coursing through Batman's veins provides a little suspense, and you'll make an uneasy alliance or two by the time you're finished. If you decided to blaze right through the story, you'd see most of what the game has to offer from a gameplay variety perspective, but the 10 hours or so it'd take you to complete the game goes up quite a bit if you get into the side missions. For the most part--I could really do without the extra set of \"fly through these rings\" glide training side missions--the missions are quite good, and certainly worth seeing.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1970846-screen_shot_2011_10_06_at_1.01.23_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1970846\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.50483271375465\" data-width=\"1345\" style=\"width: 1345px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1970846-screen_shot_2011_10_06_at_1.01.23_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1970846\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48227/1970846-screen_shot_2011_10_06_at_1.01.23_pm.png\"></a><figcaption>The Batsuit. Seems like you might want to put this on. Fast.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Despite the appearance of a big, open city, Batman: Arkham City isn't really an \"open world\" game. In fact, much of it is extremely similar to the previous one, though the various enhancements eventually add up to a lot. The combat isn't dramatically different, but you can pull out more of your gadgets in a quick-fire fashion, letting you work them into the middle of your combos. If multiple enemies attack, you can tap the counter button multiple times to repel all of the incoming attacks at once. The flow of fighting is as good as it's ever been, and the additions are definitely welcome. Traversing the big-looking city is made easier by glide and dive-bomb mechanics that make it feel like you're hang-gliding around the world. You can get from one end to the other in a minute or two, once you've gotten good at gliding, floating, and grapple boosting off buildings to gain altitude. It's a simple trick, to be sure, but all these abilities mean that simply moving around the environment is fun. You'll also have new items to use, both to solve puzzles and to fight enemies. Freeze grenades, for example, serve a dual purpose. When you see pipes emitting hot, deadly steam, you can plug them up with a freeze grenade. If you bust it out in combat, you can root enemies to the ground, giving you time to saunter over and beat the living crap out of them.</p><p style=\"\">The enemies have found more ways to deal with the Batman, too. There aren't as many situations where you find yourself in a room filled with gargoyles or other similar high perches, but when you do find yourself swinging from one safe position to the next, enemies equipped with infrared goggles will see you in the dark, unless you acquire a specific upgrade designed to neutralize their advantage. You'll also see some enemies with transmitting backpacks that prevent you from entering detective vision, preventing you from keeping track of your enemies until you've disabled the backpack. Enemies with blades, stun guns, and shields also appear, forcing you to mix up your tactics. Lastly, you'll occasionally see that one enemy in a pack of bad guys glows green. This denotes that he is an informant for the Riddler.

Most of these are hidden in plain sight around the city. There are also security cameras and other breakable objects around the city for you to destroy, giving you hundreds upon hundreds of little, repetitive things to complete if you want to see everything. I... didn't do this. It's a bit extreme. At least the game gives you ways to mark these objects on your map, so it's less about hunting them down and more about just going to the spots and finding the items. Once you've completed the game, you're dropped back into the city to mop up any side missions and collecting. Or you could just jump right into <a data-ref-id=\"3015-150\" href=\"/new-game-plus/3015-150/\" slug=\"new-game-plus\">New Game Plus</a>, which is a harder setting that removes the counter icons (making combat more challenging) and mixing up the enemy placement to give you tougher enemies earlier in the game. Any trophies you've found stay collected in New Game Plus, so you won't be repeating everything your second time around. If you like Batman's combat a lot, playing through this way is a great way to get a second, tougher dose of it.</p><p style=\"\">Arkham City's story features a second playable character, but there's a catch. Yes, you can play as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-654\" href=\"/catwoman/3005-654/\" slug=\"catwoman\">Catwoman</a> in four different chapters that pop up at specific points in the story. But these sequences only happen if you've entered a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5244\" href=\"/new-purchase-incentives/3015-5244/\" slug=\"new-purchase-incentives\">code</a> included with new copies of the game or if you purchase access. Locking away relevant main story content--her story intertwines with Batman's--feels especially despicable. Maybe you can just chalk it up to the changing face of the video game industry as it tries to find ways to curb used sales, but it's a fairly annoying way to handle the situation.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That said, the main difference between Catwoman and Batman is that Catwoman isn't nearly as interesting to use in combat. Most of the skills carry over in a very direct fashion--her <a data-ref-id=\"3055-327\" href=\"/whip/3055-327/\" slug=\"whip\">whip</a>, for example, is used in the same way that Batman's cape is, allowing you to briefly stun enemies. And she only has a couple of items to use. Caltrop spikes can be used to trip and knock over enemies from a distance, and bolos can be used to... trip and knock over enemies from a distance. Her story sequences, however, are reasonably interesting, and there are also Riddler trophies that can only be collected by Catwoman, forcing you to do a little exploring as both characters if you truly want everything. It's not a world-ender either way, but if you like to buy games used, consider yourself informed.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1917340-243_harley_bats_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1917340\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1917340-243_harley_bats_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1917340\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1917340-243_harley_bats_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1917340-243_harley_bats_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Harley's out there, making sure Mr. J's in good health and ready for anything.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Outside of the main story, you can opt to replay Catwoman's four chapters (again, only if you have the required components) or jump into the challenge rooms. The challenge rooms, which appear as a part of \"Riddler's Revenge,\" give you a chance to flex your combat or predator muscles in rooms that are unlocked as you collect Riddler trophies in the main game. Some of these rooms come right out of the campaign. Speaking of campaigns, the challenge mode now has a mini-campaign mode that lets you string three challenge rooms together, with modifiers that force you to change up the way you play. So, in some cases, you might be forced to start with less health, a stricter time limit, and so on. Some are positive, like electric batarangs that eliminate enemies in one shot. The game provides several campaigns of its own, each with an individual leaderboard, but you can also string any of the levels together in a custom campaign, if you like.</p><p style=\"\">If you want to be reductive about it, Arkham City is more Batman, and if you want more Batman, there's no question: you should play this game. But there's more to it than that. In the two years since Arkham Asylum, there hasn't really been anything like it until now. Getting another chance to use Batman's considerable combat talents as you engage in one of the best fighting systems going today is a joy. The city looks terrific, like it's one step away from just bursting into flames as criminals crawl across every single surface doing... whatever it is that criminals do when they're locked in a city-shaped prison. The interior areas look just as good, giving you a sense that, again, this is a realistic place that's been overrun. The voice acting, featuring plenty of the same cast members that performed so perfectly last time around, is incredibly sharp, with writing that fits what you'd expect from most of the different characters you face. But to sum it all up, it's hard to imagine any fan of action games coming away from Arkham City disappointed. It might not rewrite the book on Batman video games, but when you're building off of such a strong position--and you're only shipping the second game with such similarities, rather than a third or fourth--it's hard to bicker too much about what changes the developers did or didn't make.</p>", "deck": "Gaming's greatest melee combat system gets even better with a few key improvements, while the rest of Arkham City gives the existing Batman formula some extra size and scope to keep things interesting.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-431/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29443/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/batman-arkham-city/3030-29443/", "id": 29443, "name": "Batman: Arkham City"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2011-10-14 06:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-98633/", "id": 98633, "name": "Batman: Arkham City"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/trackmania2-canyon-review/1900-432/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62561/1908989-trackmania2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1908989\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/62561/1908989-trackmania2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1908989\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/62561/1908989-trackmania2.png\"></a><figcaption>You can skin your cars using the in-game editor, if you like.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You drive cars in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28194\" href=\"/trackmania-2-canyon/3030-28194/\" slug=\"trackmania-2-canyon\">TrackMania 2: Canyon</a>, but it's not really something that I'd call a racing game. Actually, it's sort of hard to pin down what, exactly, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-642\" href=\"/trackmania/3025-642/\" slug=\"trackmania\">TrackMania</a> is. I suppose it's a time trial, really. Rather than racing against cars, wheel-to-wheel, it's primarily about getting the best lap times you possibly can--even if you're doing it on a server filled with up to 200 players, that really just means you're connected to a chat room full of other people doing the same thing, and you can see their racing ghosts as you all try to best one another before time expires. It's also a predominantly online game with a weird, vibrant community that's pumping out so many new tracks that you might not ever see the same one twice. It's quirky and does an awful job of explaining itself to new players, which might make it practically impenetrable, but the core of it is astounding and exciting fun that's perfect for sucking up whatever free time you happen to have available at any given moment.</p><p style=\"\">There's a single-player component to TrackMania 2 as well as an online side, and between them you end up with a few different (and sometimes confusing) ways to measure progression. Offline, you can race on the game's official tracks. By default, there are three different ghosts to choose from, which gives you a visual representation of the track's bronze, silver, and gold times. But you can also turn to the game's online leaderboards and download the (way faster) ghosts of the speediest strangers in the world. After beating the gold medal time, you'll be offered the chance to set an \"official\" time on a track. This is the one that gets sent up to the game's centralized leaderboards, and depending on how you do, you'll earn a number of \"skill points,\" which in turn gives you an overall ranking for your offline performance. If you totally crap it up on your official run, you can try again--but you'll have to wait five minutes before you're allowed to try again. You could probably use the extra practice time, anyway. This has been a somewhat controversial change amongst the game's community, as in the previous game you could simply try your official run again right away after sending in a nominal amount of your in-game currency. Personally, I think they're sort of freaking out about nothing, but maybe that's because I don't put a lot of stock in the game's single-player side to begin with.</p><p style=\"\">But if you <i>do</i> care about the single-player side of TrackMania, you should know that Canyon is reduced compared to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10362\" href=\"/trackmania-united-forever/3030-10362/\" slug=\"trackmania-united-forever\">TrackMania United Forever</a>. Part of that is made obvious by the name. This is strictly a Canyon environment, and not a collection of seven different tile sets, like United was. But on top of that, many of the modes and level styles found in the previous game are simply missing. So if you liked Platform, Stunts, or Puzzle, you'll be disappointed with the solo portion of TM2. The game also seems as if it doesn't track stunts at all, yet stunts is still listed as a game mode in multiplayer. Again, this isn't something that's really dragging me down, as the Canyon environment is quite good and the time trials and online racing is the part about the game that really gives TrackMania its staying power. But it's a little odd to see a sequel cut so many features.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/121/1883536-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1883536\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56235294117647\" data-width=\"850\" style=\"width: 850px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/121/1883536-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1883536\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/121/1883536-1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The default Canyon car can be skinned however you like, but they all drive the same.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That Canyon environment is probably the biggest change in TrackMania 2, since it provides both the look of the game and the way the car handles. Yeah, I said car. In TrackMania, all cars are created equal on a per-environment basis. So there are multiple skins to choose from, and you can find a handful of user-created 3D models online, but the car will always handle and drive the way it was designed to handle and drive. The Canyon look gives the game a Southwestern vibe, with plenty of plateaus and caverns surrounding the tracks. The car handling feels sort of similar to the Island environment from the previous TrackMania. The car's capable of super-fast speeds and it's very easy to kick the rear end out into a drift, in case you need some help making some corners. Figuring out when you can take a turn at full speed and when you'll need to drift around a turn is one of the keys to keeping your lap times low.</p><p style=\"\">But maybe I'm beating around the bush. The best part about TrackMania is that it's <i>weird</i>. The block-based track editor makes it relatively easy for folks to construct their own tracks, and thousands of tracks have already been created. So if you get online and start hopping around the various servers, you'll usually be able to find a ton of tracks you've never seen before. Some are designed to be \"full speed\" tracks, where you never need to take your finger off of the gas once you've lined up the right angles for all the corners. Others get more technical, requiring you to think about when to drift and how to line up and handle tricky sets of curves. Some are just ridiculous, gimmicky tracks built around figuring out and exploiting some little secret. You'll start to recognize a lot of the various blocks used to make tracks almost immediately, but the best track authors are putting the blocks together in crazy ways. The amount of variety, as you might have guessed, is what gives TrackMania its replayability. But it'd sure be nice if it was easier to see all this stuff.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1989895-cher-believe-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1989895\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.70381231671554\" data-width=\"341\" style=\"width: 341px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1989895-cher-believe-1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1989895\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1989895-cher-believe-1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1989895-cher-believe-1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>How'd this get here?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">TrackMania's community is extremely dedicated. They'd have to be, because TrackMania 2: Canyon's cooler options and features feel hidden below the surface. You can import a lot of user-created content, from new car models and skins to tracks, horns, avatars, and so on. The game has a built-in system of user-created minisites that let users hawk their wares for an exchange of in-game currency. But this system feels buried and is poorly explained, leading to a better alternative: community websites built to distribute tracks, modes, and other in-game information. Via the server software's plugin system, users have created mods that sit on top of the server and add music players, better chat options, widgets that let you vote on if you like or hate tracks, a unified records system that tells you the fastest times on a given track, regardless of which server the time was set on, and so on. Much of these plugins were created for the previous TrackMania, and it's kind of insane that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2201\" href=\"/nadeo/3010-2201/\" slug=\"nadeo\">Nadeo</a> hasn't worked to integrate more of these now-crucial features directly into the game itself. Out of the box, a TrackMania 2 server simply tells you what place you're in at that moment. It's great that the community has filled in the gaps, but in some ways it's disheartening that so little has changed.</p><p style=\"\">That's the only major problem here. The main change in Canyon is the new environment and a new, higher standard for graphics. When you turn it all the way up, it's a great-looking game. But it's surrounded by an awful UI that feels like it wasn't designed to be used by actual humans and, due to a serious lack of an instruction manual for this digital-only release, it's not easy for new players to figure out what, exactly, is going on. It all holds TrackMania 2: Canyon back a little bit. A streamlined front-end and more clearly spelled-out progression would probably go a long way. But if you're up for digging around and find the idea of a driving game that's a little left-of-center exciting, TM2 is kind of incredible.</p>", "deck": "TrackMania 2: Canyon is a weird, wonderful driving game, but everything surrounding the game itself feels like it's actively trying to discourage you from playing at all.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-432/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-28194/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/trackmania2-canyon/3030-28194/", "id": 28194, "name": "TrackMania\u00b2 Canyon"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-10-17 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-106243/", "id": 106243, "name": "TrackMania 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/ratchet-clank-all-4-one-review/1900-433/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863294-ro418919a4owigwump01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863294\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863294-ro418919a4owigwump01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863294\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1863294-ro418919a4owigwump01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Screen-filling bosses are the norm, requiring focused fire.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There aren\u2019t many big studios making <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1206\" href=\"/combat-based-platformer/3015-1206/\" slug=\"combat-based-platformer\">platformers</a> anymore, but like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-411\" href=\"/ratchet-clank/3025-411/\" slug=\"ratchet-clank\">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> has proven a mostly reliable companion for the platforming fan, especially if you also love shootin\u2019.</p><p style=\"\">If you haven\u2019t yet played 2009\u2019s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25673\" href=\"/ratchet-clank-future-a-crack-in-time/3030-25673/\" slug=\"ratchet-clank-future-a-crack-in-time\">Ratchet &amp; Clank: A Crack in Time</a>, you\u2019re missing out on a truly great platformer, one filled with terrific action, clever puzzles and gorgeous visuals.

This is a much different Ratchet &amp; Clank.</p><p style=\"\">All 4 One is a multiplayer take on the Ratchet &amp; Clank series, a prospect that sounds rather fantastic on paper, especially given how well <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> was able to adapt its premiere platforming series into a maniacal, sometimes <i>too</i> crazy four-player bonanza in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26841\" href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-wii/3030-26841/\" slug=\"new-super-mario-bros-wii\">New Super Mario Bros.

The mechanics driving Mario and friends are pretty basic, however, which is not necessarily the case for Ratchet &amp; Clank, a series that\u2019s deceptively simple.</p><p style=\"\">To go into All 4 One thinking it\u2019s just another Ratchet &amp; Clank that happens to have multiplayer is a mistake--you should know that up front. If you won\u2019t play All 4 One with one or more people, there\u2019s not much for you here. All 4 One ditches the exploratory aspects of previous Ratchet &amp; Clank games in favor of a very linear, focused experience. In single-player, the game spawns an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-994\" href=\"/ai-construct/3015-994/\" slug=\"ai-construct\">AI</a>-controlled Clank to ensure the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-108\" href=\"/cooperative-play/3015-108/\" slug=\"cooperative-play\">co-op</a> parts are playable. While the AI is certifiably competent, it\u2019s not a very fun solo game--the action is fairly straightforward, with weapon choice meaning little and puzzles staying simple.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">All 4 One\u2019s hook relies on having a blast because things are becoming totally insane around you, by virtue of four people and a million enemies running around at once. The times where I\u2019d actually play with four people, it would become nearly impossible keep track of everything, as explosions would constantly fill the screen to the point of obscuring your view entirely. All 4 One doesn\u2019t have a particularly punishing death mechanic, however, so when the combat causes the screen to implode into a series of indecipherable fireworks, it\u2019s not a big deal. Players can be quickly resurrected without consequence by another player, and the group only goes back to a previous checkpoint if everyine is unconscious at once, which isn\u2019t common.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/91798/1732085-ratchet3d313.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1732085\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5622641509434\" data-width=\"530\" style=\"width: 530px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/91798/1732085-ratchet3d313.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1732085\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/91798/1732085-ratchet3d313.jpg\"></a><figcaption>As with previous games, the dialogue is actually pretty funny.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I don\u2019t really recommend four players if you\u2019re looking to actually play the game--it\u2019s mostly dumb goofiness, like New Super Bros Wii. Two people seemed like the sweet spot here, learned while working through most of All 4 One with a friend by my side.</p><p style=\"\">For most of All 4 One, the pacing is fast, frenetic and enjoyable, with transitions from standard combat to quick puzzles at a rapid pace, typically punctuated with a variety in the form of a rail grinding, strapping on a jetpack, piloting a space ship or maneuvering a boat. Even with two people, trying to coordinate movement is mostly impossible, which usually resulted in a room full of laughs as disaster ensued.</p><p style=\"\">Insomniac Games must also be commended for fixing a problem that\u2019s plagued co-op platformers. So many casual game fans struggle with platforming, and waiting for one person to make it through a section you finished minutes ago is not only frustrating, it\u2019s actually lead to annoying arguments I'd rather not repeat. With All 4 One, you can tether yourself to another player by tapping Triangle, which means the less skillful participant(s) can follow another\u2019s lead without having to communicate anything. It works perfectly.</p><p style=\"\">In fact, All 4 One managed to avoid co-op frustration until the game\u2019s slightly-too-long campaign starts to near its conclusion, where an increase in challenge is achieved through endless waves of repetitive, powerful enemies. Suddenly, ammunition management becomes a real worry, and progression becomes a cycle of moving from room to room and holding down the R1 button until stuff stops blowing up. This goes on for hours, transforming combat from wild (in mostly a good way) to tedious and grindy.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863293-ro418918a4ojetpack01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863293\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863293-ro418918a4ojetpack01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863293\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1863293-ro418918a4ojetpack01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1863293-ro418918a4ojetpack01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You should probably avoid touching the glowing things.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps more of an affront to traditional Ratchet &amp; Clank fans is how weapon choice means far less in All 4 One. Besides how upgrading has been relegated to store purchases rather than rewards for actual use, it doesn't really matter which weapon you're picking so long as it's firing, and the game strongly emphasizes players picking the same weapon, which causes damage multipliers when fired at once. Sure, some weapons are more powerful than others, but the end result usually means two or more people firing the same thing at the same dude, rather than picking the \"right\" weapon. Enemies don't require much strategy in All 4 One. Especially towards the end, crowd control demands the game boil down to endlessly cycling between rockets and grenades. Yawn.</p><p style=\"\">Somewhere else, this might not be a big deal, but in a Ratchet &amp; Clank game, it just feels...off.</p><p style=\"\">Ratchet &amp; Clank with multiplayer works--mostly.

To be more accurate, Payday is basically The Best Part of <i>Heat</i>: Done as a Game With Middling Results. Payday is about heists, often heists very similar to those seen in Michael Mann's <a data-ref-id=\"3035-490\" href=\"/los-angeles/3035-490/\">Los Angeles</a> crime classic. Four players get together, take down a bank, or a jewelry exchange, or a cash-flush meth lab, fending off waves of cops and rival criminals while achieving specific, randomly-generated objectives. It's a neat idea that could be amazing were it more rich in atmosphere, storytelling, and excitement. Sadly, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7623\" href=\"/overkill-software/3010-7623/\">Overkill Software's</a> game is lacking in all of these things. There are moments of multiplayer thrill to be had here, but they're infrequent, and sometimes tough to get to.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1969175-paydayslaughterhouseheistscreenshot3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969175\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1969175-paydayslaughterhouseheistscreenshot3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1969175\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1969175-paydayslaughterhouseheistscreenshot3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Based solely on the concept, Payday: The Heist should be the best game ever made...</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">First and foremost, understand this about Payday: The Heist: this is a multiplayer game. Offline play exists, albeit in a form similar to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3025-1342/\">Left 4 Dead's</a> own single-player mode. It's there if you want it, but there's no conceivable reason why you'd want it. The accompanying A.I. is radically inferior to just about anyone you could possibly scrape together for an online match, and the total disconnection of the action from anything resembling a story means that there's no real progression here. There are six heist missions. You do them entirely independently of one another. The only constant is the characters, who are less characters, and more differently-accented voice actors who are solely there for player differentiation purposes.</p><p style=\"\">With this in mind, also understand that it is not the easiest process in the world to get into a game of Payday: The Heist. A couple of days after its launch, only a handful of players seem to be online at any given time, and I found myself running into a variety of strange \"this lobby has already been filled\" errors, even for lobbies that only appeared to have a single player in them. Getting into a game proved far more of a chore than it arguably had any right to be, considering the meager number of players seemingly hitting the servers.</p><p style=\"\">But let's presume that you do manage to navigate potential errors and a dearth of players, and find your way into an actual game of Payday, and let's also presume that the players you're in a game with are competent, collected individuals who know how to follow instructions and patiently follow the progression of a map. If all these various things prove to be true, you will have some fun with Payday: The Heist.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The missions are varied in style and objectives; some involve straight money-heisting, while others involve revenge plots, and even a prison break that plays like a weird reference to the opening scene of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3724\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iii/3030-3724/\">Grand Theft Auto III</a>. All of this stuff seems referential in one way or another, though most of those references are directed toward the aforementioned <i>Heat.</i> From the bank job that uses a musical score almost identical to the one in <i>Heat</i>'s iconic bank heist, to a mission literally called \"Heat Street\" where you run around shooting up cop cars, it seems that Overkill's crosshairs were aimed squarely at Mann's movie when developing this game. There's even a hacky reference to Tom Sizemore's \"For me, the action is the juice\" line shoved into one of the loading menus.</p><p style=\"\">I wish I could say that any of Payday's content was anywhere near as compelling as Mann's film, but frankly, it's not even as compelling as most modern shooters. Overkill has liberally cribbed from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\" href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374/\">Valve</a>'s Left 4 Dead methodology, building missions around a lengthy series of objectives--kill the alarms, set up saws and drills to break into various things, find a guy who has a key for something, and so on--that sometimes employ randomized locations to keep things fresh. There are even horde-like waves of SWAT cops and FBI agents that periodically show up to try and derail your mission in aggressive fashion. Again, pointing to that ideal scenario where everyone knows exactly what they're doing, these missions can be quite fun. Heists are lengthy and full of fast-paced combat and strategy that keeps you on your toes. If you and your cohorts can communicate, there's a good bit to like here.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1844427-632713_20110714_790screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1844427\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.6253164556962\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1844427-632713_20110714_790screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1844427\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57793/1844427-632713_20110714_790screen004.jpg\"></a><figcaption>...Unfortunately, the final product doesn't quite make good on all that potential.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you can't, you're boned. All it really takes is one or two associates with a Waingro mentality to completely screw up a mission. You have to know what objectives each of you are taking on, and when to stick together. A heist can still be successful so long as one of you survives, but the waves of cops that Payday tosses at you are so hefty that it's damn difficult for anyone to survive if even one person decides to freelance. A tight challenge is a good thing, but the action itself is not necessarily thrilling enough to want you to keep coming back time and time again to try these missions should you end up with some regularly lousy players.</p><p style=\"\">Part of that comes from the weirdly antiquated feel of Payday. It looks okay, but often feels like a game out of time, like something that should have popped out around the early 2000s, back when a game could sort of ride on controversy over gameplay. The shooting is fine, but there's something Counter-Strike-mod-feeling about the action that makes it feel kind of...fake. Like one of those fake video games some writer on <i>Law &amp; Order</i> would have conceived for an episode in which real bank robbers used the game as a road map for a real robbery, and Jack McCoy is up in arms and wants to charge the developers as an accessory or something. Except Payday is real, and feels a few years past when it might have actually made some kind of impact.</p><p style=\"\">Ultimately devoid of impact as it is, Payday is a game that does manage to offer a few hours of entertainment. Its spartan slate of features and atmospherically lackluster missions fail to give it the kind of addictive quality so important to a game like Left 4 Dead's lasting appeal, but for those who just feel like mowing down some cops, heisting some loot, and reminiscing about how damned good a movie <i>Heat</i> is, Payday is serviceable enough across the board.</p>", "deck": "Bank heists meet Left 4 Dead in this sometimes exciting shooter.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-434/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35520/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/payday-the-heist/3030-35520/", "id": 35520, "name": "Payday: The Heist"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-10-20 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-113583/", "id": 113583, "name": "Payday: The Heist"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/uncharted-3-drakes-deception-review/1900-435/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2005243-london_deal_cutter_drake_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005243\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2005243-london_deal_cutter_drake_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005243\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2005243-london_deal_cutter_drake_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hey, look who it is!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If I were to tell you <a data-ref-id=\"3010-827\" href=\"/naughty-dog-inc/3010-827/\" slug=\"naughty-dog-inc\">Naughty Dog</a> has just delivered another superb <a data-ref-id=\"3025-957\" href=\"/uncharted/3025-957/\" slug=\"uncharted\">Uncharted</a> game, would you be the least bit surprised?

But it certainly does match them. There's a slight sense of \"been there, done that\" in the way this game hews so closely to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22420\" href=\"/uncharted-2-among-thieves/3030-22420/\" slug=\"uncharted-2-among-thieves\">Uncharted 2</a>'s masterful blend of puzzle-solving, parkour, and dizzying action scenes. I was more than ready to continue being there and doing that the moment the last game ended, so I'm thrilled just to play another sequel that hits all those right notes, even if they're the same notes, with such precision. And you probably will be too.</p><p style=\"\">By now, you should know if you're onboard with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-162\" href=\"/nathan-drake/3005-162/\" slug=\"nathan-drake\">Nathan Drake</a>'s smirking brand of globe-trotting adventure or not. If you are, you could just stop reading here, because anyone who enjoyed the previous games should play Uncharted 3, full stop. The storytelling is certainly familiar; our hero visits numerous far-flung locales, invokes some ancient explorers, twiddles a few antique cartographer's instruments, and gets shot at with disturbing frequency on his way to rediscovering a long lost land of supernatural significance. At least you're seeing some brand new sights, with memorable levels set in places as wide-ranging as an ancient stronghold underneath London, and a brutal desert that seems to go on forever. In a slight tonal shift, this third game replaces the series' overtly evil mercenaries and warlords with... <a data-ref-id=\"3005-18258\" href=\"/katherine-marlowe/3005-18258/\" slug=\"katherine-marlowe\">an old lady</a>. But that old lady has a smoldering inner malevolence of her own, and she's got ties to the pasts of Drake and his cigar-chomping mentor <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1833\" href=\"/victor-sullivan/3005-1833/\" slug=\"victor-sullivan\">Sully</a>, to boot. One of Uncharted 3's quieter joys is getting to see a glimpse of the history between these two, what drives them to risk life and limb in the pursuit of ancient wealth that always seems just out of reach. This game provides back story and context in a way the previous games didn't.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2005250-syria_marlowe_match_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005250\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2005250-syria_marlowe_match_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005250\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2005250-syria_marlowe_match_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>By Uncharted standards, Marlowe is an understated sort of villain.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In a lesser game, there's a good chance you wouldn't even care. It's true that Uncharted presents a by-the-book action-movie milieu populated by characters who fit into tidy genre archetypes, but even in this third game it's still a little startling that they aren't all boringly one-dimensional. The primary credit for that belongs to the dialogue and voice work, which remain as snappy and artful as they've always been. I don't know if it's more remarkable that the game seems to have a pithy remark ready for every conceivable occasion, or that so many of them are actually funny and natural without being cheesy. But there are also a few moments with emotional range, in between all the swashbuckling, where you realize there's a toll taken on Drake and the people close to him in exchange for his driving obsession with the past. This is still an action-movie storyline, but it's a damn good one, with people who feel relatable and real.</p><p style=\"\">The basic act of playing Uncharted--the shooting, the climbing--hasn't changed at all, though a few things feel improved here and there. You'll see some neat touches in the hand-to-hand fighting where Drake will contextually grab nearby objects and incorporate them into the brawl. And I felt like the stealth gameplay, though entirely optional, worked a little more smoothly than in the last game. Enemies still soak up a few too many bullets--you've decided by now how bothersome that is--but for a game that offers so much variety, it's impressive that the combat is as intense and challenging as it sometimes can be, especially on harder difficulties. And like the last game, Uncharted 3 also excels at letting you interact with its lushly detailed environments in unexpected ways. It's still genuinely impressive how an organic-looking scene in a village or old temple or even a capsized cruise liner can break down into a logical series of handholds for you to climb and jump across, nevermind how conveniently placed those handholds are.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21654/1970742-310881_219096294821152_124203117643804_621761_867568277_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1970742\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/21654/1970742-310881_219096294821152_124203117643804_621761_867568277_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1970742\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21654/1970742-310881_219096294821152_124203117643804_621761_867568277_n.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/21654/1970742-310881_219096294821152_124203117643804_621761_867568277_n.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The part where you play the game is as great as it ever was.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The core game is familiar, but Naughty Dog continues to have plenty of fun within those confines, even managing to insert some meta-humor in a couple of places that pokes fun at the very mechanics that drive the game. And though the shooting and the climbing occupy the vast bulk of your time, one of my favorite things about Uncharted is the occasional foray into an ancient temple or crypt. This series is especially good at offering puzzles that blend into the level design, making you reference your in-game notes and really look closely at everything around you to see how it all fits together. Some of my favorite moments in these games are the ones when you slide some clockwork mechanism into place and, stone grinding against ancient stone, the truth is revealed. Those are the instances where you feel like you're actually touching a small part of the long-forgotten, mystical past Drake is so eager to recover, and there are several great moments of that sort in here.</p><p style=\"\">And then there are the set pieces. Man, those set pieces. Think back to Uncharted 2, and the first things you remember are that building collapsing, or the fight on top of the speeding train. Uncharted 3 has its own healthy list of action sequences the likes of which you've never seen in another game... except Uncharted 2. Do you want to dangle a hundred feet above a roaring inferno as an entire castle collapses around you? How about fist-fighting a seven-foot strongman on the lowered ramp of a soaring cargo plane? Maybe shoot an RPG at a speeding convoy from horseback? (Who wouldn't?) The way the game frequently transitions almost seamlessly from gameplay to cinematic cutscene back to gameplay in short bursts is just as exciting as it was when you'd never seen it done before. There's still nothing else quite like it.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2005245-planetarium_floor_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005245\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2005245-planetarium_floor_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005245\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2005245-planetarium_floor_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2005245-planetarium_floor_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Discovering ancient stuff is one of this game's primary joys.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's a danger, though, to meticulously hand-crafting your action sequences the way these games do, with all the fixed camera angles and split-second timings. Some of the game's more tightly scripted action sequences, particularly the ones where you're running somewhere at breakneck speed, can fall apart if you don't do exactly what the designer wanted you to do exactly when they wanted you to do it. When you're running toward the camera from a giant wall of water and can't really see where you're going, one split second's hesitation or missed jump means you're going to repeat everything you just did, which is a detriment to the frenetic way these games move. This isn't at all troublesome from a gameplay standpoint, since the game liberally checkpoints your progress. It's more about maintaining the momentum of these fast-moving segments which depend on the action never stopping. When you miss your cue, it stops, and suddenly the excitement is gone. But the benefits of this kind of design are worth the occasional collapse, and moreover, this style of sequence tends to work more often than not. And when it works, it <i>works</i>.</p><p style=\"\">Actually, the other danger of such a tightly scripted experience is that you only get to play it for the first time once. There might be more and better thrills per minute packed into this game than any competing one, but once you've seen it, you've seen it. So it's a good thing that there's as robust a multiplayer component in Uncharted 3 as you could possibly want, once you've gone through the eight-to-10-hour storyline. Both the cooperative and competitive elements are incrementally improved over the similar modes in the last game, with a rich progression system that ties them together and offers more ways to customize your weapons and appearance than most players will probably ever unlock.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2005244-lost_desert_day_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005244\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2005244-lost_desert_day_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005244\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2005244-lost_desert_day_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2005244-lost_desert_day_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game does some great stuff with its playable camera angles.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The competitive multiplayer still feels a bit like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War</a>, not just because you snap to cover but also due to the relatively slow movement and aiming speeds. There are plenty of interesting modes here to keep you busy, and some interesting things going on within the matches, such as a random bonus that's sometimes granted to the currently losing team. There's plenty on the cooperative side as well. The standout is a five-chapter adventure mode that has three players fighting through a coherent storyline set in a variety of the story maps, with some light dialogue and cinematics added in for context. There's even an appearance by some old familiar faces in there. Then there's Hunters, which feels like a nod toward <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3025-1342/\" slug=\"left-4-dead\">Left 4 Dead</a> since it pits two fully equipped player characters against two other, weaker human players who are joined by a bunch of AI guys.

It\u2019s an issue that you\u2019d hope would be addressed as the series transitions to the technically superior <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\" href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" slug=\"kinect-support\">Kinect</a> with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35553\" href=\"/just-dance-3/3030-35553/\" slug=\"just-dance-3\">Just Dance 3</a>, and while it\u2019s an improvement, it still falls well short of the platform standards set by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-648\" href=\"/harmonix-music-systems-inc/3010-648/\" slug=\"harmonix-music-systems-inc\">Harmonix\u2019s</a> Kinect launch title, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31705\" href=\"/dance-central/3030-31705/\" slug=\"dance-central\">Dance Central</a>. Which is a real shame, because there\u2019s a ton of songs featured in Just Dance 3 that--were the game\u2019s motion detection able to keep up with the choreography--would be a lot of fun to dance to, as well as some ambitious multiplayer and community features that, quite frankly, deserve a better game.</span></p><p style=\"\">If just dancin\u2019 is all you\u2019re interested in, you can hop straight from the main menu into a big list of songs, all playable from the get-go. Just looking at this list, it\u2019s easy to get excited, assuming you\u2019ve got a taste for popular dance songs from the past 30-plus years of pop music, with an emphasis on the past decade or so. Current artists include The Black Eyed Peas, Cee Lo Green, Katy Perry, and LMFAO, and the hits stretch all the way back to Aretha Franklin, Earth, Wind &amp; Fire, A-ha, and C+C Music Factory. It\u2019s a populist playlist with lots of one-hit wonders, but it would seem that the first step in getting players dancing is giving them plenty of songs they already know. As with previous Just Dance games, the dancers you\u2019ll be imitating are digitized videos of actual dancers, usually in thematically appropriate wardrobe, and everything\u2019s been pushed through a glowing neon filter to give it a weird candy-raver vibe.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1886045-jd3screenshotdynamitekinect.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1886045\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1886045-jd3screenshotdynamitekinect.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1886045\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1886045-jd3screenshotdynamitekinect.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Squeezing four players into the frame compounds the sloppy move detection.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Some songs feature choreography that supports more than one player at once--up to four, depending on the song--and these group routines often have unique moves for each player, as well as interaction between multiple players. Regardless of the number of players you actually have, the choreography can be pretty ambitious. Though you can always choose to play on either easy or normal--which requires you to move either just from your waist up or your whole body--and each song comes with an intensity rating, you have to sift through the big list to find the easier stuff, and once you\u2019re in a song, you\u2019re not given great direction on the upcoming moves. That learning a full dance routine takes some repetition shouldn\u2019t be too surprising, I suppose, but Just Dance 3 does a rotten job of easing you into it, providing minimal feedback if you\u2019re doing it wrong. There seems to be very little crossover in dance moves from one routine to another, which makes each routine rather unique, but it also means that what you learn in one routine rarely caries over to the next, like you\u2019re starting from scratch every time.</p><p style=\"\">The real fundamental problem, though, is that the dance routines are just too complex for the Kinect to keep up. You might expect that this means the game has trouble registering your moves correctly, and that definitely does happen, but more often, it will just give you a pass, so long as you\u2019ve got the basic idea. Actually, even \u201cthe basic idea\u201d is being generous, as I managed to score decently on songs doing The Carlton the entire time, or just sitting on my couch, waving my arms around. It\u2019s far too lenient, stripping what little motivation you might have to learn the actual routine. It\u2019s even apparent from the game\u2019s twitchy menus that the developer was still wrestling with how to get the most out of the Kinect when it shipped Just Dance 3.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1886048-jd3screenshotgonnamakeyousweatkinect.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1886048\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1886048-jd3screenshotgonnamakeyousweatkinect.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1886048\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1886048-jd3screenshotgonnamakeyousweatkinect.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1886048-jd3screenshotgonnamakeyousweatkinect.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>With better motion detection, recording your own routines would've been a game-changer.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That's kind of a shame, because outside of the fundamentals, there are some promising ideas in the game\u2019s Just Create section.

You can also record yourself dancing one of the game\u2019s predefined routines, which, upon playback, the game will then superimpose on the regular dancer, with the notion of providing you with some insight into how you can improve your routine, though I didn\u2019t find this mode particularly useful.</p><p style=\"\">The Just Dance series feels like it\u2019s headed in the right direction with Just Dance 3, but it still has a long way to go.

While this certainly speaks in part to the paucity of great experiences the Kinect has produced since then, it doesn\u2019t take away from the fact that Dance Central did for shakin\u2019 your rump what <a data-ref-id=\"3025-289\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\" slug=\"guitar-hero\">Guitar Hero</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">Rock Band</a> did for making you feel like a rock star. Even if you\u2019ve got two left feet and you\u2019d never survive on an actual dance floor, you can still feel like a lock-poppin\u2019 bad-ass in your living room, working up a decent sweat in the process. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35532\" href=\"/dance-central-2/3030-35532/\" slug=\"dance-central-2\">Dance Central 2</a> doesn\u2019t reinvent this particular wheel, but it improves upon it with new features that range from using simple voice commands to queue up your favorite tracks to two-player simultaneous play. Dance Central 2 doesn\u2019t feel as ambitious as the original Dance Central, though that\u2019s admittedly asking a lot, since it still manages to fully replace its predecessor in every meaningful way.</span></p><p style=\"\">Keeping with the Harmonix ethos of treating its games like platforms to be built upon, existing Dance Central players can seamlessly use any existing <a data-ref-id=\"3015-329\" href=\"/downloadable-content/3015-329/\" slug=\"downloadable-content\">DLC</a> they\u2019ve purchased in Dance Central 2, and for a $5 fee, they can import all of the songs from the first game as well. Even if you haven\u2019t already indulged in DLC, or this is your first Dance Central, the 44 tracks included on the disc are ample enough. Although it\u2019s a fresh group of songs, the makeup of the Dance Central 2 playlist doesn\u2019t stray too far from the tone established by the first game, with a distinct focus on modern club hits, and enough recognizable, older dance hits to keep the mix accessible. For every Donna Summer or Bobby Brown song, there\u2019s a gaggle of David Guetta, Pitbull, and Usher tracks, but even if you don\u2019t know the songs, they remain highly danceable.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1862849-dancebattle02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862849\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1862849-dancebattle02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862849\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1862849-dancebattle02.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dancing with a friend cuts the awkwardness of pretending to know what you're doing.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is partially because Harmonix has chosen a collection of really catchy tunes, regardless of era, but most of the credit has to go to the intuitive instruction and constant feedback of DC2\u2019s dancing system, inherited almost whole-cloth from the first game. The idea is simple--you square up with a digital avatar, mimicking their moves with the help of a set of constantly rotating flash-cards--the flash-cards giving you the basic idea of what the next move will look like, and the avatar filling in the rest. If you\u2019re not quite hitting your marks, the offending body parts will light up with a red outline, making it easier to adjust as is necessary. It feels roughly as responsive and accurate as it did in the original Dance Central, which may sound like faint praise, but without the strength of the game\u2019s motion-recognition and its ability to provide you meaningful feedback in the moment about what you need to adjust in order to really kill it, the rest of the package would be meaningless.</p><p style=\"\">Dance Central 2 builds on this strong base with some new features that seem so fundamental--like support for two-player simultaneous play, and the structured crew challenge story mode that introduces you to the game\u2019s colorful collection of dance crews--it\u2019s kind of hard to believe they weren\u2019t in the original Dance Central to begin with. There are other additions, like the ability to use voice commands to quickly queue up a track; the ability to build your own custom playlists of songs; the improved flexibility of the instructional Break It Down mode, which makes it easier to single out specific moves in a routine that might have been giving you trouble; or the choice to make the interpretive freestyle sections of a song optional. These only come through iteration, but still have a meaningful impact on the experience. The whole thing feels more complete, and just a little bit slicker, with even flashier presentation, and more personality for the neon-futuristic dance crews.</p><p style=\"\">Dance Central 2 is better than Dance Central, though that margin will vary significantly depending on how dissatisfied you were with the original\u2019s lack of two-player support or a structured story mode to ease you into the experience.

Trappings aside, it was an old-fashioned, by-the-books zombie shoot, with all the pop-up zombies, blind corners, and carpal-tunnel-aggravating gunplay that entails.</span></p><p style=\"\">The guts of the thing remain unchanged in House of the Dead: OVERKILL Extended Cut, but swapping out the Wii Remote for the remarkably more responsive <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4669\" href=\"/playstation-move-support/3015-4669/\" slug=\"playstation-move-support\">PlayStation Move</a> controller makes all the difference in the world. (The game can, theoretically, be played with a standard DualShock controller, but come on. If that\u2019s how you\u2019re going to be, I\u2019m done trying to talk to you like a reasonable person.) OVERKILL is still a fundamentally shopworn experience, but it\u2019s a game you can now cruise through to savor the grit and gristle of the sights and sounds.</p><p style=\"\">Sure, OVERKILL owes just about every profane, mutilated ounce of personality it\u2019s got to the Quentin Tarantino/Robert Rodriguez <i>Grindhouse</i> double feature, from the lint-lashed policy trailers and lurid XXX warnings to the crass characterizations of rule-book-burning renegade cops and revenge-fueled strippers--hell, even the narrator, whose guttural delivery makes every forced alliteration sound lewd. But the very fact that OVERKILL hits so many of those little details with such perfect pitch makes it work. That said, OVERKILL\u2019s characters--and indeed, certain machinations of the plot itself--are scaldingly misogynistic and foul-mouthed. Were the tongue not planted firmly in cheek, it might be genuinely offensive. Even as it stands, the hail of \u201cfucks\u201d and \u201cmotherfuckers\u201d has a numbing effect within the first few levels.

The game\u2019s overall structure is established in the first level--cutscene, shooting, cutscene, boss fight--and then adhered to slavishly for the eight subsequent levels.

There\u2019s a trio of minigames that are good for about one play a piece. A fistful of bulletpoints differentiate the Extended Cut from the original release of OVERKILL, including a couple bonus levels, some new weapons, and a handful of oddball gameplay modifiers, though some of that content is oddly buried. The most significant differences are inherent to the shift from the Wii to the PlayStation 3, with the visuals and the controls receiving a noticeable bump in fidelity. This is clearly the better version of OVERKILL, but I\u2019m not convinced that it\u2019s better enough to warrant a second purchase for those that already played it on the Wii.</p><p style=\"\">House of the Dead: OVERKILL Extended Cut so relishes wallowing in its own filth, that at a point it\u2019s easy to start questioning whether the stuff that\u2019s terrible about it is that way on purpose.

It\u2019s the most shameful of guilty pleasures, brain-dead and proud of it, best suited for those with a lust for the minutiae of cinema's seedier side.</p>", "deck": "Snappy support for the PlayStation Move makes it easier to appreciate the loving grindhouse aesthetics stitched over this otherwise familiar light-gun shooter.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-438/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23425/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-house-of-the-dead-overkill/3030-23425/", "id": 23425, "name": "The House of the Dead: OVERKILL"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-10-26 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114091/", "id": 114091, "name": "The House of the Dead: Overkill - Extended Cut"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/battlefield-3-review/1900-439/", "description": "<p style=\"\">It took more than five years for the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-51\" href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" slug=\"battlefield\">Battlefield franchise</a> to move from 2 to 3, but that's not to say there haven't been plenty of other battlefields to visit in that time. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17828\" href=\"/battlefield-2142/3030-17828/\" slug=\"battlefield-2142\">Giant mechs</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21220\" href=\"/battlefield-heroes/3030-21220/\" slug=\"battlefield-heroes\">cartoonish heroes</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1215\" href=\"/battlefield-bad-company/3025-1215/\" slug=\"battlefield-bad-company\">comedic misfits</a> have all gotten their chance to duke it out in traditional, download-only, and free-to-play versions of the series. For good or bad, almost all of them operated on the belief that the Battlefield you knew needed to be changed in some fundamental way. Battlefield 3 instead feels like a return to the series' roots, with most of the effort put on the large-scale multiplayer action and impressive visuals that made the series popular in the first place. And that's totally OK, because Battlefield done this well is still a total blast to play.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/46777/2006452-bf32011-10-2508-50-09-fuj7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2006452\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/46777/2006452-bf32011-10-2508-50-09-fuj7.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2006452\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/46777/2006452-bf32011-10-2508-50-09-fuj7.png\"></a><figcaption>You'll spend a decent portion of the campaign in bad QTEs.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That's not saying Battlefield 3 doesn't make any mis-steps of its own. A mediocre, me-too single-player mode feels overly serious and almost feels bolted onto the side of another, better multiplayer game. It doesn't help that the six-hour campaign plays like a direct reaction to the popularity of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1258\" href=\"/modern-warfare/3025-1258/\" slug=\"modern-warfare\">Modern Warfare</a> series, emulating that game's tone and pacing. Heavily scripted sequences are the focus here, and you'll spend a good bit of your time unable to do much but watch the game play itself. This happens in both a number of on-rails levels and a disturbing number of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">Quick Time Events</a> that often begin and end with the press of a single button. The QTEs happen so often that when even a rat in a sewer pipe triggers the mechanic, you'll begin to wonder if the developers at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1978\" href=\"/dice-co-ltd/3010-1978/\" slug=\"dice-co-ltd\">DICE</a> were purposefully making fun of themselves.</p><p style=\"\">The actual plot involves a small group of American and Russian soldiers trying to prevent nuclear attacks by a group of terrorists called the People's Liberation Resistance and a man named Solomon. The events unfold through a series of globe-trotting flashbacks as the main character, Staff Sergeant Henry Blackburn, is interrogated by a good-cop-bad-cop intelligence duo after the fact somewhere in New York. The writing is easy to follow, but the high drama and always-on-the-go pacing feels a little tired when compared to its modern military peers. It doesn't help that Battlefield 3's campaign very much wants you to go where it wants you to go, providing warnings anytime you stray too far off course. This can be annoying when you think a side street might offer a better flanking position or when you try to get the jump on enemies before the scripted sequences begin. Still, the action flows fast throughout and introduces you to the weapons and vehicles you'll encounter in the hectic multiplayer modes.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130533/1973125-battlefield3october6v9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1973125\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130533/1973125-battlefield3october6v9.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1973125\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130533/1973125-battlefield3october6v9.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Taking off from a carrier is one of the campaign's biggest thrills.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">What Battlefield 3's main campaign does well is show off the game's beautiful, varied level design and set pieces. You'll fight through city streets, jungles, corridors, deserts, open skies, and office buildings with very little motive other than for DICE to show off how impressive its <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1095\" href=\"/frostbite-engine/3015-1095/\" slug=\"frostbite-engine\">Frostbite 2.0</a> engine is. Early in the game you'll walk out onto the deck of an aircraft carrier in choppy seas and seconds later move seamlessly into a cloud-filled sky as a jet pilot. It's gorgeous stuff and feels like a noticeable step forward in terms of graphical realism on both the console and the PC. Of particular note are the lighting, rain, and fog effects, which give these environments a real sense of depth. Your surroundings are lit up with the addition of realistic flashlights that not only pick up the dense air around you, but can be used quite effectively to blind your assailants. You'll also find streetlights and lamps that, depending upon the angle, can either hurt or help you. Combined with the engine's destructible environments, this provides an ever-changing landscape that play a little differently depending on how the battles continue.</p><p style=\"\">This sense of realism transfers over to the multiplayer maps, which are inspired by the campaign but seem grander because of their immense scale and the removal of invisible walls. Previous Battlefield level design always felt a little sparse to me, letting fast vehicles do much of the work to hide the often empty areas between contested zones. By contrast, Battlefield 3 feels saturated with minute detail. You'll find giant radio antennas that peak out of hilly outcroppings and crowded Parisian streets that run parallel to rushing waterways, to mention just two examples. One map called Damavand Peak even features a thrilling base-jumping portion where the attacking team skydives off a cliff into the opposing team's stronghold. You'll find yourself waiting until the last possible moment in a 10-second freefall to deploy your parachute before enemy players shoot you down. That feeling of naked vulnerability is a constant throughout the multiplayer, and the brief relief of cover and shade becomes your chief strategy as you try to outposition your opponents. You'll also lose visibility if the sun is low and in front of you. At night, the opposing team's flashlights are either a dead giveaway from afar, or a deadly strategy up close.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The multiplayer modes themselves are nothing terribly new, and are instead refinements and tweaks of the previous games in the series. While most players will jump straight into Conquest mode with its 64-player (or 24-player for consoles) point-to-point action, the attack-and-defend Rush mode from <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1215\" href=\"/battlefield-bad-company/3025-1215/\" slug=\"battlefield-bad-company\">Bad Company</a> returns and feels the most improved. Teams can no longer destroy stations with brute force and must now physically place charges when outside vehicles. That gives the mode the tension it previously lacked, and provides for longer firefights where the defenders have just a bit of an advantage. Small changes like this abound and are mostly for the better. Battlefield commanders are gone, making the game more squad-oriented and easier to grasp. That's good, because most players will only bring one or two buddies into their matches and just want to be able spawn and support each other without having to worry about completing objectives.</p><p style=\"\">The four-class system has also received a bit of a makeover in a few key ways. The medic has merged with the assault class and can now deploy health packs. Sniper-based scouts have to deal with scope sway, and will give of glint from their scope if they sit in a position for too long. While that glint does help identify campers, the large areas of engagement still tend to reward patient players who attack from cover. The addition of secondary scoring and bonuses for spotting enemies helps with obscure enemies, and gives players a real incentive to keep their teammates aware of incoming or obscured attackers. With these tools, a group of even two voice-chatting opponents can really dominate the battle if they work together and provide spotting for each other.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103922/1816216-bf3_tank_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1816216\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56242615202836\" data-width=\"2539\" style=\"width: 2539px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103922/1816216-bf3_tank_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1816216\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/103922/1816216-bf3_tank_03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/103922/1816216-bf3_tank_03.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The smoke effects really stand out in the desert maps.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Vehicles are still a big part of the large battles, and you'll normally spend about half your time cruising in a tank, boat, plane, helicopter, or whatever else spawns near your base. Tanks can now be disabled, which gives you a few quick moments to exit before certain doom. That doesn't always do you much good, since you're most certainly in bigger trouble by the time your tank explodes, but it beats the instant deaths that were so common in the previous games. I won't lie, I still find the helicopter and jet mechanics a tad tricky, especially when using a mouse, but this seems more a fault of my own as my teammates were more than willing to take the driver's seat as I took over the guns. You can also unlock abilities for your vehicles similar to the way you unlock accessories and weapons for your base soldier class.</p><p style=\"\">Outside the team-based multiplayer, two-player co-op provides a third mode of play for those willing to take on missions with a friend, and I'd highly recommend you communicate with mics if you want to get through these quickly. The co-op missions are substantially harder than the campaign mode and usually require some level of teamwork to get things done. There are six scripted missions that unlock in order and usually require multiple playthroughs to learn the scripted events. The \"Drop Um Like Liquid\" level seems to suffer from this the most, where you have to snipe several targets with a buddy extremely quickly before hostages are killed. Since the spotting mechanic will often target two enemies when grouped together instead of one, you and your teammate might get confused on who's attacking who. With no checkpoints, that means patient gamers will need to replay the 15-or-so-minute levels a few times to learn exactly when certain scripting triggers are going to happen. Other than the repetition, the co-op levels are pretty exciting and provide a much better experience than the campaign missions they support.</p><p style=\"\">In addition to the PC, I played through the campaign on the PS3 version, and it seemed to be a smooth experience that mostly mirrored the high quality and visuals of my beefier home PC. The console version does come with a slight bit of pop-in for the larger levels, but is certainly still a looker. The difference between the versions then mostly lies in the online and social networking <a href=\"http://battlelog.battlefield.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Battlelog</a> service that the PC version requires to play. Although your console and PC soldiers will both display stats and info on Battlelog similar to something like <a href=\"http://www.bungie.net/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bungie.net</a>, the PC version actually does its matchmaking, party management and voice control through the browser itself. I went into Battlelog worried and a little confused at this different approach, but after a half dozen hours of online play I'm now convinced it's an altogether better way to manage your game sessions. Although I did have some problems importing my friends list from other services, once I got Battlelog running it was pretty seamless to start up games with friends and chat with buddies. The best advantage to the system is that you spend less time looking at connection screens and can instead peruse your own stats and snoop on other platoon members between games.</p><p style=\"\">Battlefield 3 is exactly what Battlefield fans most likely wanted: a chaotic, gorgeous multiplayer game with small, but important tweaks to what already worked in past games. That it includes a short, somewhat mediocre solo campaign and some hit-or-miss co-op action does not detract from the fact that, online, this is the best Battlefield game yet. The PC version's online matchmaking tools are way ahead of the curve and a good example of how to do social networking in video games the right way. For those who didn't enjoy Battlefield before, the extra features likely won't be enough to bring you over, but those who just want to play a much-improved Battlefield--mixed-up, crazy, \"I can't believe that just happened\" Battlefield -- should feel right at home.</p>", "deck": "A short, derivative campaign does little to get in the way of the best version of multiplayer Battlefield yet.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-439/", "platforms": "PC, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27006/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/battlefield-3/3030-27006/", "id": 27006, "name": "Battlefield 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-10-27 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-107839/", "id": 107839, "name": "Battlefield 3"}, "reviewer": "Dave"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/infamous-festival-of-blood-review/1900-440/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2008894-_home_secure_media_fob_launchscreens_cole_elite_concert.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2008894\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2008894-_home_secure_media_fob_launchscreens_cole_elite_concert.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2008894\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2008894-_home_secure_media_fob_launchscreens_cole_elite_concert.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Plenty of new enemies to stick a stake in.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Maybe it was too much time spent watching <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6151\" href=\"/charlie-brown/3005-6151/\" slug=\"charlie-brown\">Charlie Brown</a> holiday specials in my youth, but I find something fundamentally appealing about seasonally-themed games.

Your old pal <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10861\" href=\"/zeke-dunbar/3005-10861/\" slug=\"zeke-dunbar\">Zeke</a> is at a bar spinning a yarn to some comely lass, about that one time legendary electro-guy <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6399\" href=\"/cole-macgrath/3005-6399/\" slug=\"cole-macgrath\">Cole MacGrath</a> became a vampire for one night. That gives the game carte blanche to get as crazy as it wants with undead monsters overrunning the city during a booze-soaked nocturnal celebration known as Pyre Night, which dresses Infamous 2's <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3467\" href=\"/new-marais/3035-3467/\" slug=\"new-marais\">New Marais</a> up in some attractive seasonal decorations. The city also feels more alive than Infamous 2 did, with more and better ambient sounds, and street parades and revelers almost everywhere you look. The crux of the story here is Cole's transformation into a minion of the sly vampiress <a data-ref-id=\"3005-21091\" href=\"/bloody-mary/3005-21091/\" slug=\"bloody-mary\">Bloody Mary</a>. You've only got until dawn to kill Mary and break your enslavement, and the game does a great job of indicating the passage of time by reminding you at certain points during the story how many hours you have left, and subtly changing the world by lightening the sky to give the sense that time is in fact running out.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2008898-_home_secure_media_fob_launchscreens_ped_mask_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2008898\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2008898-_home_secure_media_fob_launchscreens_ped_mask_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2008898\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2008898-_home_secure_media_fob_launchscreens_ped_mask_001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>New Marais' seasonal makeover helps establish the mood.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Festival of Blood is built on the Infamous 2 engine and assets, which is to say it feels almost exactly like Infamous 2 (which in turn felt a lot like the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20599\" href=\"/infamous/3030-20599/\" slug=\"infamous\">Infamous</a>). That means a lot of dodging and rolling in between hurling bolts of lightning and electric grenades and rockets at enemies. Since the game is still Infamous 2 at heart, it's worth noting that the same combat issues are here--mainly, it's easy to get ganged up on at inopportune times, or occasionally stick to a piece of the level design when you're trying to dodge. There's one meaningful new ability in here--the power to turn into a cloud of bats and soar right over all those buildings you had to climb up slowly in the previous game--that really changes the feel of how this game plays. It's incredibly fast to get around the city now, so fast that you might have a hard time going back to Infamous 2 after this. Festival of Blood reminds me of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20827\" href=\"/bioshock-2/3030-20827/\" slug=\"bioshock-2\">BioShock 2</a>'s masterful <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3357\" href=\"/minervas-den/3035-3357/\" slug=\"minervas-den\">Minerva's Den</a> in the way it accelerates the progression of your abilities over a compressed timespan; you start out with basic Infamous powers at the beginning and quickly advance to more powerful weaponry by completing combat challenges. The game works the vampiric theme into the gameplay pretty well, since you're fighting (and staking) other vampires almost constantly, and you get a \"vampire vision\" sort of mode that lets you reveal disguised vampires walking among the populace, as well as some nifty hidden collectibles.</p><p style=\"\">It's those collectibles that add a little bit of meat to what is otherwise a pretty lean experience. You could burn through the story missions alone in a couple of hours here, especially since the flight ability makes it so quick and easy to get from place to place. But there are 100 items scattered around that increase the length of your flight time, as well as 10 invisible glyphs painted onto building walls that reveal some voiceovers from Mary about her past, stretching all the way back to Colonial America and even earlier. Those voiceovers do a surprisingly good job of fleshing her out as a character, and I found myself seeking them out not just to earn a trophy but because I wanted to hear everything she had to say. The glyphs are also fun to hunt for, since slipping into your vampire vision will show you ghostly arrows that point in the general direction of more arrows that will eventually lead you to a new tale.

There's a nice upgrade to the editor that lets you pose character models in specific positions and then take still images of them, then overlay comic book-style talky bubbles on the image to create a little narrative to go along with your mission. I long ago made the life choice not to create my own content with these sorts of tools, but I could see people creating some decent stories if they put some work in. You can play as many user-made levels as you want after the game ends, though I tend to think open worlds feel a little lifeless once you've completed the storyline that runs through them.</p><p style=\"\">Anyway, the game is $10. In my mind, that throws any quibbles about how long it is right out the window, especially since it contains the visual fidelity and gameplay of a full retail title. Sucker Punch made a laudable decision taking Festival of Blood standalone, rather than casting it as an add-on that requires Infamous 2. As a result, you've got a three-gigabyte download to chew through, but that opens this game up to anyone who didn't bite (ha!) on the previous game.

Yes, it features giant <a data-ref-id=\"3055-9\" href=\"/hamburger/3055-9/\" slug=\"hamburger\">hamburgers</a> that must be assembled via repeated, unsanitary stompings, and it has a multitude of enemies you must dodge that range from enraged hot dogs to particularly pissed-off pickles. But beyond the core conceit, World Tour is virtually unrecognizable compared with the arcade classic that spawned it. Unfortunate as that is, the truth is that BurgerTime: World Tour actually isn't a half bad game on its own merits, particularly in multiplayer situations. Just don't go in expecting the BurgerTime you fell in love with lo those many decades ago, and you might even have some fun.</p><p style=\"\">In order to update <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4702\" href=\"/burgertime/3030-4702/\" slug=\"burgertime\">BurgerTime</a> for the modern era, developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7297\" href=\"/monkeypaw-games/3010-7297/\" slug=\"monkeypaw-games\">Monkeypaw Games</a> made some fairly significant changes to the formula. Where the game once existed in a single, flat, pixelated plane, each stage in World Tour has been blown out into a 2D/3D hybrid that extends the playing field significantly. In addition, the radical and controversial concept of \"jumping\" has been added. This on its own may sound like blasphemy to those who enjoyed the original BurgerTime. The arcade game and its subsequent ports offered no such option to its heroic, playable chef. Dodging enemies was, instead, a game of intense, stressful ladder climbing that resembled the sort of evasive antics of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-463\" href=\"/pac-man/3025-463/\" slug=\"pac-man\">Pac-Man</a> ilk. Now you can hop over enemies in addition to climbing around them, a concept that will no doubt boil the bile of every BurgerTime superfan out there.</p><p style=\"\">As for the rest of you, probably not so much. As I said, World Tour is a fairly different beast from its original namesake. The gameplay is generally less stressful, and a bit faster-paced. Yes, you are still assembling comically oversized hamburgers that have been separated into various pieces across many different platforms, and you are still required to run across those various burger ingredients to drop them down a platform and eventually put them all together, but playing World Tour feels a lot more like a modern platformer, shrunk down into bite-sized levels, than anything remotely similar to the arcade original.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">And again, that's fine. BurgerTime: World Tour's gameplay might not resemble its predecessor too terribly much, but it's decent enough at what it does. The single-player is a bit lacking, in that there are only a few worlds to plow through and you'll likely do so in a mere couple of hours. The tacked-on boss fights don't do much to vary things up, nor do the added power-ups. Gadgets like rocket boosters and invincibility-giving energy drinks don't do much to break up the core flow of burger assemblage, and apart from a few weapons like pepper shakers and bludgeoning spatulas, there isn't much combat to speak of in the game, meaning you'll be jumping and avoiding enemies more often. That's generally fine, though the lack of enemy variety and meager amount of level variation does make things wear thin a bit quicker than you might like.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1830347-burgertime_hd_playstation_3_ps3_1301515170_005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1830347\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1830347-burgertime_hd_playstation_3_ps3_1301515170_005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1830347\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1830347-burgertime_hd_playstation_3_ps3_1301515170_005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>...but as its own piece of multiplayer silliness, it ain't half bad!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Fortunately, BurgerTime fares a good bit better in multiplayer. Up to four players can jump into a match, all competing to create an ever-regenerating series of burgers within a specific time limit. While the enemies and level traps remain, where BurgerTime: World Tour's multiplayer stands out is in your ability to screw with your opponents. All the attacks you can launch against in-game enemies you can also toss at your opponents, allowing for a constant stream of antagonistic tomfoolery through each match. It's a good bit of fun that's only handicapped by the relatively small number of multiplayer maps, and the aforementioned lack of gameplay variety. It's the sort of thing you can totally play for an hour or so with some friends (as it works both offline and on), but it's unlikely you'll find yourself too terribly addicted to it.</p><p style=\"\">If you can accept that BurgerTime: World Tour is something fairly different from the arcade classic you may remember, there's a good chance you'll find some enjoyment in it.

It doesn't make grand changes to the things that have worked in the past, though it does make some smart additions that some will certainly appreciate. But if you've finally reached your limit on the scripted campaigns and COD's specific style of multiplayer, none of those changes are going to pull you back in. It probably doesn't take a genius to figure all that out, but if that's all you want to know about this year's Call of Duty, well... now you know, I guess.</p><p style=\"\">There's more to say about Modern Warfare 3, of course. Let's start with the game's single-player campaign. The action picks up moments after the conclusion of 2009's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24713\" href=\"/modern-warfare-2/3030-24713/\" slug=\"modern-warfare-2\">Modern Warfare 2</a>, with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-23\" href=\"/john-soap-mactavish/3005-23/\" slug=\"john-soap-mactavish\">Soap</a> in bad shape as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-330\" href=\"/captain-price/3005-330/\" slug=\"captain-price\">Captain Price</a> and Nikolai get him to the chopper and away to relative safety. The members of Task Force 141 have been entirely disavowed by the government, but that's not going to slow them down much as they link up with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5799\" href=\"/nikolai/3005-5799/\" slug=\"nikolai\">Nikolai</a>'s posse and continue the hunt for the ultranationalist Russian, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10832\" href=\"/vladimir-makarov/3005-10832/\" slug=\"vladimir-makarov\">Makarov</a>. Meanwhile, the war that Makarov started when he shot up that Russian airport back in MW2 is still in full swing, so you'll mainly switch between Price's globetrotting crew and a Delta Force squad as they attempt to push the Russian army off of American soil, though some other factions and playable characters pop up when appropriate. The early part of the game is something of a mess. It's paced like you're running through an explosion factory, and after the first act I sat down, tried to put together where the story had gone up to that point, and had trouble remembering anything other than a handful of vehicle or mounted gun moments that felt more like a shooting gallery than a first-person shooter.</p><p style=\"\">That's one of my big problems with the game's campaign. It feels like a large chunk of your time is spent as a passenger in a vehicle or as part of a fixed-position sequence, whether it's the long-past-cliched \"jump into a helicopter and shoot its gun for a few minutes\" section or a \"hold this position by firing this mounted gun until a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-361\" href=\"/helicopter/3055-361/\" slug=\"helicopter\">helicopter</a> arrives\" shootout. The rest of the time, the game demands that you follow another soldier who is helpfully marked with the word \"follow\" right over his head, in case you forget. This, obviously, isn't that different from past campaigns, but the structure's over-reliance on sections where they don't even trust you to walk on your own combined with a general lack of new ideas makes the campaign pretty dull from a gameplay perspective.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1793680-mw3_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1793680\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.563\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1793680-mw3_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1793680\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57793/1793680-mw3_3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Gas masks, eh? Well, better safe than sorry.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The weird part is that even if it isn't much fun to play, the always-on nature of the script makes the campaign pretty interesting to watch, almost as if it was developed specifically to provide strong footage for trailers and commercials. It starts with constant explosions that seem to be taking out everything around you, from a tank that you happen to be sitting in to huge monuments that may or may not fall right on top of you as they collapse. While the engine might start to show a bit of age when you're sitting still, the game doesn't deal in quiet moments very often. And in motion, the smooth frame rate that has become one of the franchise's hallmarks still holds up its end of the bargain. Also, as the story begins to come together, it starts to get pretty interesting. It's not going to win any awards for its writing, but if you've been following Price and Soap for the past three games, seeing this journey come to an end is pretty fulfilling. Modern Warfare 3's campaign deals out more closure throughout its five-or-so hours than just about any other game released so far this year.</p><p style=\"\">After watching the credits roll, the game funnels you into Special Ops mode, which returns from Modern Warfare 2 with 16 new two-player encounters, a new variant, and a version of the player progression that's found in the proper multiplayer. I guess I should say \"up to two players,\" but playing these missions by yourself isn't much fun. As in MW2, some of the Spec Ops missions are more interesting than others, with some merely having the two players make their way through an environment that appeared in the single-player campaign while others force the two players to do more than simply shoot their way from start to finish. The more interesting missions tend to split the players up, with one player covering the other from an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-667\" href=\"/lockheed-ac-130/3055-667/\" slug=\"lockheed-ac-130\">AC-130</a> or a set of remote turrets. Another has one player running around in a juggernaut suit disarming bombs as the other player provides cover from above via a sniper rifle or occasional Predator missiles. Two obstacle courses are here, too, for those of you who miss the timed runs from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2133\" href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare\">COD4</a> and MW2. As you play, you'll earn experience points that unlock additional tiers of missions as well as new gear in the new survival variant.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The survival side of Spec Ops is a mostly traditional <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\" href=\"/horde/3015-3021/\" slug=\"horde\">wave-based survival</a> mode similar to what you'd expect out of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War</a>'s Horde mode or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2\" href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" slug=\"halo\">Halo</a>'s Firefight. You and another player (again, it's not much fun by yourself) take on waves of increasingly difficult enemies with 30 seconds of downtime between fights to give you time to regroup. The enemies start out stupid and fairly weak--slow-moving men with shotguns, typically--but quickly escalate to include helicopters, juggernauts, and dogs strapped with <a data-ref-id=\"3055-896\" href=\"/c4/3055-896/\" slug=\"c4\">C4</a> that explodes when the dog dies. Forget the \"you might be offended by this\" moment in the campaign--exploding dogs might actually be the most messed up and awesome thing in all of Modern Warfare 3. That between-round break is a perfect time to rearm yourself. As you fight, you earn money that can be spent buying and upgrading your weapons, buying armor, airstrikes, or even perks as you attempt to prolong your life as long as you possibly can. Survival works pretty well and gives you an opportunity to get used to the multiplayer maps, but it's a bit of a shame that it's still limited to two players.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2022713-resistance_domination.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2022713\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2022713-resistance_domination.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2022713\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2022713-resistance_domination.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2022713-resistance_domination.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Juggernaut suits pop up in multiplayer a lot more than they used to.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There are 16 of those multiplayer maps and they vary in size and theater, giving you the standard array of war-torn environments including a Wall Street-based level that reminded me a lot of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26754\" href=\"/crysis-2/3030-26754/\" slug=\"crysis-2\">Crysis 2</a>'s New York sequence. On these maps you play the standard array of Call of Duty multiplayer game modes across multiple playlists. The basic action remains largely unchanged--Headquarters Pro is still Headquarters Pro. You can still shoot down <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3022\" href=\"/uav-17-hawk/3055-3022/\" slug=\"uav-17-hawk\">UAV</a>s and other air support with launchers or concentrated fire from other weapons. It still makes that cool little thwip-thwip-thwip noise whenever you hit a target. It still lets you go prone... but you can no longer dive to prone like you could in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26423\" href=\"/call-of-duty-black-ops/3030-26423/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-black-ops\">Black Ops</a>. Rocking guitars come in to let you know that, yes, you've gained a level. And you'll probably be hearing that noise a lot more now, because in place of the currency system from Black Ops, the developers of MW3 have simply added more bars to fill across, like, every single object in multiplayer. The guns themselves now level up as you use them, and unlocking camo patterns, attachments, and new weapon-specific proficiencies is done by using the same gun for a long stretch of time. The weapon proficiencies are essentially a perk for that specific weapon. Kick, for example, reduces recoil. Flagging a weapon for dual attachments is also done using this weapon perk, which is nice because it frees up more room on your custom classes for the game's mixture of new and old perks.</p><p style=\"\">Most of the perks in Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer are designed to create the same sorts of scenarios found in previous games. So if you want to be completely invisible to enemy radar and silent when you move and shoot, there's a way to build a class that accomplishes that task. Reloading more quickly, becoming immune to fall damage, making it a bit easier to call in air support, and more are all possible with the perk system. New perks include Recon, which paints targets for your team if you hit them with explosive damage. If you do that enough, Recon upgrades to Recon Pro, which paints targets if you hit them with bullets, as well. By and large, though, a lot of it feels like a light remix of what's been available in previous Call of Duty games.</p><p style=\"\">More interesting are the changes made to the killstreak system, which has evolved into a \"strike package\" setup that lets you choose three different styles. Assault is the old system--kills for streaks and it resets upon your death. Most of the options available on that tree are the same sorts of air strikes and other offensive-minded bonuses. Support doesn't reset when you die, but most of its abilities are more tactical, like advanced UAVs or a duffel bag full of tactical vests that your team can equip for extra damage protection. Specialist tosses out all of the support bonuses and instead gives you additional perks as you reach specific kill targets. Having six perks at once can, unsurprisingly, make a huge difference, but you lose those bonus perks and your streak resets after every death. You can earn points for doing team-minded things like capturing flags, which gives players an additional incentive to \"play properly.\" You can set your strike package on a per-class basis, giving you a lot more to configure and try as you try to find setups that match your personal play style. These changes will probably feel fairly minor to casual players of the game, but the additional of the Support tier means that those middling players will get to use a lot more of the fun stuff during multiplayer matches. And if you're any good at all, calling in an EMP--one of the top items on the Support tier--becomes nearly trivial. When you combine that with Hardline Pro, which gives you a point towards your streak for every two assists that you get, players will be racking up those point streaks in no time. It's a very smart addition to the game.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2022714-gas_mask.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2022714\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/2022714-gas_mask.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2022714\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2022714-gas_mask.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/2022714-gas_mask.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>More gas masks. That can't bode well.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But more XP bars and a redesigned streak system isn't all that's new. There are two new variants on Team Deathmatch, as well. Kill Confirmed shifts scoring from the act of the kill itself to collecting dog tags that pop out when a player goes down. Collecting enemy tags earns points for your team, and you'll want to collect tags from your own teammates, too, if only to deny the enemy those points. Team Defender plans one flag on the map and the team that currently controls it gets double points. These slight shifts of focus make the games feel different from the standard TDM setup. The private match section has also been expanded. Gun Game and One in the Chamber, both found in Black Ops, return in MW3 along with a handful of other types that place some or all of the players in juggernaut armor. You can further configure and tweak these modes--you can opt to disable one-hit kills in One in the Chamber, for example, if you want to totally ruin that mode--to allow for a variety of custom games. These tweaks can be saved and shared via the game's vault section, but all of the private match games lack any sort of matchmaking. Maybe this says more about the way I play games and the people I keep on my friends list more than anything else, but this essentially makes all of the private match games completely worthless. You'll have to scrounge up a list of likeminded folks and coax them into a lobby before you can see any of it. Matchmade One in the Chamber and Gun Game matches were one of the cool high points in Black Ops' take on Call of Duty multiplayer, and it's unfortunate to see them crippled.</p><p style=\"\">Perhaps being a social Call of Duty player will be easier this year now that <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7004\" href=\"/call-of-duty-elite/3015-7004/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-elite\">Call of Duty Elite</a> is upon us. This is a largely free service that adds a layer of Halo-style heat maps and other statistical data to every game you play. So if you want to see where everyone died in a specific match, you can get on the web site and see it. There's an on-console application that launches separately and also lets you scrub through the data and check in with your clan and groups. The groups are hashtag-based, so if you want to start a tag for \"St. Louis Citizens That Love Coldplay,\" you could start that up and players can join as they see fit. Actually, that's probably over the character limit. Anyway, you get the idea. It's mostly a mashup of the stats services provided by Halo and Steam's group system, albeit without any sort of real admin controls over the groups. If you want to keep it private and kick out idiots, you'll need to join a clan. Clan calendars and other data can be updated on the site and pushed directly into the game. If you already have a social network that you're into--and that social network happens to be Facebook--you'll also appreciate that the game can take your Facebook friends list in, as well. Lastly, there is also a paid tier for Elite that gets you access to a year's worth of downloadable content as well as contests and original video programming. None of that content was available prior to the game's launch, but former wrestling lady <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2247\" href=\"/stacy-keibler/3005-2247/\" slug=\"stacy-keibler\">Stacy Keibler</a> will be hosting one of the shows. I'm sure her KDR is much better than yours.</p><p style=\"\">When I take a step back and total it all up, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 is still one of the best first-person shooters of the year. The multiplayer changes are just interesting enough to make me want to configure classes all over again, and it has a lot of good maps to choose from. The amount of closure in the campaign--I can't imagine they'll call a game \"Modern Warfare 4\" at this point--makes it worth seeing, even if it isn't always exciting to play. And Spec Ops has always been more exciting to me than Zombies. But the whole thing feels old at this point. The new tricks feel more like a distraction designed to make you forget how revolutionary Call of Duty 4 was. I will certainly buy and play a copy of Modern Warfare 3, but there's nothing here that makes me want to shut off the rest of the world and obsess over it anymore. It makes you wonder if the franchise's best days are truly behind it and where <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1526\" href=\"/infinity-ward/3010-1526/\" slug=\"infinity-ward\">Infinity Ward</a> and/or <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6917\" href=\"/sledgehammer-games/3010-6917/\" slug=\"sledgehammer-games\">Sledgehammer</a> go from here, let alone <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1488\" href=\"/treyarch/3010-1488/\" slug=\"treyarch\">Treyarch</a>, who will presumably iterate on Black Ops in 2012.</p>", "deck": "Modern Warfare 3 feels split between the great excitement of its time-tested multiplayer and the feeling that this whole style of game has just gotten old.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-442/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35129/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3/3030-35129/", "id": 35129, "name": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-11-08 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-110839/", "id": 110839, "name": "Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-review/1900-443/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024712-stormatronach_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024712\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024712-stormatronach_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024712\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024712-stormatronach_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>I didn't even see this yet!

It's simply because, like <a data-ref-id=\"3010-786\" href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" slug=\"bethesda-softworks\">Bethesda</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3025-174\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls/3025-174/\" slug=\"the-elder-scrolls\">Elder Scrolls</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-183\" href=\"/fallout/3025-183/\" slug=\"fallout\">Fallout</a> games before it, Skyrim offers a fantasy world so rich and expansive that to describe other games in those terms after playing this one would just feel hollow. The sheer amount of content packed into the game is a true marvel of video game production; it's even more marvelous that all of it is so well executed that you want to see and do everything, and better still that you're free to play it all in whatever way you want. Unsurprisingly, Skyrim isn't perfect in a technical sense, but it gets close enough to fulfilling the potential of this specific role-playing format that the experience it offers is absolutely essential.</p><p style=\"\">Bethesda has famously explored a different province of its fantasy world <a data-ref-id=\"3035-92\" href=\"/tamriel/3035-92/\" slug=\"tamriel\">Tamriel</a> in each Elder Scrolls game, and this fifth entry turns its attention northward to the frozen Nordic land of the game's title. Skyrim is literally Nordic in that it's the homeland of Tamriel's hearty, honor-bound people the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1015\" href=\"/nord/3015-1015/\" slug=\"nord\">Nords</a>. But Skyrim's design is also heavily influenced by real Nordic artwork and traditions. It's pretty much all Vikings, all the time; everything is all longships and mead halls and the exaltation of battle as a conveyance to the glorious Nord hereafter of Sovngarde. There's a great coherence to Skyrim's cultural identity that makes it feel like a grounded and believable place, if a fantastic one. But it's also as diverse as any land in Tamriel, and you'll frequently bump into members of every one of The Elder Scrolls' factions, from snooty high elves to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-953\" href=\"/argonian/3015-953/\" slug=\"argonian\">Argonian</a> lizardmen. Skyrim's nine capital cities are especially memorable, to say nothing of the sprawling lands between them: one, a mining center, is hewn right out of a mountainside, while another rises defiantly on a hilltop in the middle of a vast plain. From end to end, this is a wonderful and endlessly intriguing land to explore.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024719-whiterunnight_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024719\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024719-whiterunnight_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024719\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024719-whiterunnight_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Skyrim is a fine-looking game when it wants to be.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's a <i>lot</i> going on here, but the crux of this game is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-551\" href=\"/dragons/3015-551/\" slug=\"dragons\">dragons</a>. After an absence so long that most of Skyrim's residents suspect they never really existed at all, the villainous wyrms have returned to scorch the countryside and terrorize its populace. As the first Dragonborn warrior to appear in an age, you're the only one around who can permanently kill a dragon, and thus the person responsible for discovering why they're back and what can be done to stop them. That quest forms the backbone of Skyrim's core storyline, and it's a story well worth seeing through to the end, with genuine twists, intrigue, and momentum that drive it forward in a way Bethesda's past games really haven't. For reference, I found <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\" href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" slug=\"fallout-3\">Fallout 3</a>'s main storyline mostly forgettable and only finished it from a sense of obligation, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20238\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion/3030-20238/\" slug=\"the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion\">Oblivion</a>'s I hardly touched at all. I suspect Skyrim's story will prove more engaging for most players; I know it was for me. And in contrast to the disappointing finality of the last two Fallout games, the way Skyrim's main story \"ends\" is also wholly appropriate for a game as open and non-linear as this one. After the events of the final quest play out, you're simply left standing there, free to continue exploring or marauding or whatever it is you want to do. The only way to view the credits is from the title screen. That struck me as a really elegant way to handle things.</p><p style=\"\">If you've played one of Bethesda's RPGs before, you know that main storyline is only a small part of what the game offers, and it's a part you're free to completely ignore in the interest of just roaming around, looking for other stuff to do. And there is so, so much other stuff. Even if there were no dragons, Skyrim would be a chaotic place with a lot of social and political turmoil going on. There's a civil war brewing, between the Imperials (from the previous game's province of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-127\" href=\"/cyrodiil/3035-127/\" slug=\"cyrodiil\">Cyrodiil</a>) who want to keep a tight rein on the indigenous populace, and a growing band of rebels led by Ulfric Stormcloak, the would-be king of the Nords. There's tension between different races squeezed into cramped living quarters. There's religious oppression, ethnic displacement, feuding families, betrayal, and plenty of murder. Even Tamriel's mischievous demigods of all bad things, the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1826\" href=\"/daedra/3015-1826/\" slug=\"daedra\">Daedra</a>, continue to meddle with mortal affairs whenever the notion strikes them. Maybe it's unfair to compare this to games that have a small fraction of the time to work with, but Skyrim builds up a rich and interesting narrative backdrop like no other game in recent memory.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024707-ratway_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024707\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024707-ratway_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024707\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024707-ratway_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024707-ratway_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Thieves' Guild will gladly take you in, if you can make them some coin.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The point is, all these dynamics make for an enormous number of interesting quests. You're free to choose one side or the other in Skyrim's civil war, with a different sequence of quests associated with either side--though I love that it's tough to decide who to support, since neither side's hands are especially clean. Old favorite quest lines like the Thieves' Guild and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2307\" href=\"/the-dark-brotherhood/3015-2307/\" slug=\"the-dark-brotherhood\">Dark Brotherhood</a> are well represented, and though the Fighters' and Mages' Guilds remain back in sunny Cyrodiil, there are respectively a ragtag group of mercenaries and a prestigious magic college in their place. Completing all the stories and quests for any one of those groups will occupy you for hours all by itself, to say nothing of the staggering number of one-off quests and minor objectives you can pick up wherever you go. Merely stepping into a new major city for the first time will expose you to more new quests and activities than you'll know what to do with. It's overwhelming in the best possible way, since each new distraction sounds interesting enough that you'll want to try to do everything. In a couple of cases, even a miscellaneous directive to check out something like a random excavation led me to an unexpected, hour-long underground ruin with its own self-contained storyline. You never know when adventure will present itself; you only know it will happen all the time, and it will pretty much always be worth undertaking when it does.</p><p style=\"\">One of the reasons it's so appealing to follow every objective you find is that the quality of the game's dungeons is greatly improved over those in Oblivion, and feels like a further evolution of the sort of combat areas in Fallout 3. Gone are the lone cave and Elven ruin repeated ad nauseam across the landscape. Every dungeon and temple and tomb I explored felt distinctive in some way, which is not to say they don't share basic textures and other artwork. But they do have unique layouts, puzzles, and often storylines that are told through characters or journals or other elements you find there. (In general, the quest designers are especially good at making you feel like you've stumbled into a series of events that was already happening before you got there.) There are a lot of deep places to delve in Skyrim, from tunnels carved out of pure ice to decrepit dwarven ruins where magic-powered automatons still stalk the hallways. After burning out on all those identical dungeons in Oblivion, it was refreshing to actually enjoy exploring them again here.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024726-skyrim_skill_trees.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024726\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024726-skyrim_skill_trees.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024726\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024726-skyrim_skill_trees.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024726-skyrim_skill_trees.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The perks system gives you a hands-on way to build a unique character.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">More refreshing than anything is the freedom to just do whatever the hell you want for as long as you want. Like its predecessors, the real magic of Skyrim lies in its matrix of interconnected systems that govern character behavior, object manipulation, the passage of time, and the ways your own abilities develop as you use them. That generalized framework for creating an enormous world and letting you explore it at your whim is as robust as it's ever been. You can talk to, pickpocket, or kill practically any character you see. Farmers and townspeople go about their daily business with little regard for your presence, unless you interfere with them. You can pick up and carry practically every item, from the finest mace to the dirtiest junk. And you've still got complete, unadulterated freedom to improve your skills in a wide variety of categories like one- and two-handed melee combat, archery, sneaking, shield blocking, multiple schools of magic, alchemy, and armor. The list goes on. Skyrim lets you dabble in all of these disciplines or focus on just a few, so you can organically create a full-on rogue who stabs people in the back, or an exceptionally powerful mage, or a guy who demolishes everything with a simple sword and shield. About halfway through, I transitioned from a combo of melee and destruction magic to one-handed melee and a shield since that fit my style better. You're never really locked into any of these choices, with the exception of the perks you pick, so you can change it up at any time.</p><p style=\"\">About those perks, the way you build your character has been dramatically streamlined, so you're no longer dumping an allotment of points into a dozen categories and waiting for the effects to trickle down to your real-world performance. Now, when you level up you simply choose whether you want to increase your health, magic, or stamina, then you're granted one perk from any of those skill categories, though each perk comes with a minimum skill requirement before you can unlock it. It was initially tempting to look at this system as removing control from the player, but the way the perks are laid out still lets you create exactly the sort of character you want to play, just with a more descriptive upgrade path and more immediate, tangible benefits. If you want to play a mage, you're going to use more magic, increase your magicka more often, and unlock perks on the magic trees. Simple as that. The game does a good job of making your character options more accessible without dumbing down or removing those options outright.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024724-windhelmthrone_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024724\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024724-windhelmthrone_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024724\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024724-windhelmthrone_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024724-windhelmthrone_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Ulfric's got a bone to pick with those damn dirty Imperials.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Combat is still not The Elder Scrolls' strongest aspect, but the feel of it has also improved significantly. Attacking with a melee weapon and blocking with a shield is a bit more tactile, though there are cases where enemies won't visibly react to an attack because they're in the middle of an attack animation of their own. In general, it's a bit easier to tell how close you need to be to connect with an enemy, but there's still some sense of flailing around blindly with your weapon. The addition of a new set of extra-powerful magic spells called shouts (derived from the ancient language of dragons) gives you some nice additional options for dealing with combat scenarios, too. There's no equivalent of the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1807\" href=\"/vault-tec-assisted-targeting-system/3015-1807/\" slug=\"vault-tec-assisted-targeting-system\">VATS</a> system from Fallout, but the third-person kill camera has made its way over from that game, giving you some awfully dramatic attack animations from time to time when you drop an enemy. Some of these look better than others, but when the camera angle and animations really line up, they're worthy of exclamation. Nothing shows how far this game has come since Oblivion better than the dragon fights, though. The first time one of those awful beasts swoops down overhead and plucks a soldier from the ground, flings him a hundred feet into the air, then circles back around to strafe you with its flame breath is a legitimately jaw-dropping moment.</p><p style=\"\">The interface, which is elegantly streamlined and clearly designed around the needs of a controller, is fantastic. Everything (with the exception of the perks screen and map) appears tastefully overlaid on top of the game world, and you can get to your inventory, perks, and map with a quick four-way pop-up menu that will get you to what you're looking for in a matter of seconds. Within your long list of stuff, you can add any item or magic spell as a \"favorite\" that you can then access from a quick list in combat, which makes it a lot easier to switch between multiple magic spells, weapons, and a shield if you want to play a hybrid class. The PC version... uses the exact same interface, but it actually works quite well with a mouse and keyboard. That's mainly because that four-way menu and the list of items and spells are all easily navigable with WASD, and even when you want to equip a highlighted item, you only need to click the mouse button you want to map it to, regardless of where the cursor is. The PC version seems like the clear winner here, since even if you don't like the default interface, you can be sure mods will come along to change not only that aspect of the game but every other one as well, in ways you and I haven't even thought of yet. The PC version also naturally looks by far the best and was able to tax even our fairly powerful office machine in the outdoor areas.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024714-tavern_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024714\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2024714-tavern_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2024714\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024714-tavern_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2024714-tavern_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Viking-like Nords give Skyrim a unique cultural flavor.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">On both PC and 360, Skyrim looks utterly fantastic in its broad strokes. The sheer variety and grandeur of the landscapes and interiors in the game is breathtaking when you stand back and behold them. There are some spots on the periphery that look less than fantastic up close, though, such as rocks clearly built out of very few polygons. Some of the textures are noticeably low-resolution on the console as well. I mention this mostly to allay any concerns that the game somehow looks bad, though; if you're stopping to examine single rocks or stare at wall textures filling your screen, you're missing the point of this game. While we're nitpicking, the voice acting is generally quite good, though I guess I would be remiss not to mention that yes, a handful of voice actors are repeated a little too often. And though Max Von Sydow does a fantastic job with his work as a wizened old dragonslayer, an obviously different voice actor recorded a few additional lines for that character. When you get the same character alternating Von Sydow and other guy in quick succession, it really sticks out. At least the game now has a more natural way of engaging your perspective with the people you're talking to. Instead of comically zooming the camera in on their faces, the game just lets them stand there and chat with you. Imagine that!</p><p style=\"\">Like me, you may have hoped Skyrim would be the game that finally allowed Bethesda to shed its reputation for making games that nearly collapse under their own complexity. It isn't. But things have gotten better. On the raw technical side, I experienced four lockups and one minor cave where the frame rate inexplicably became unplayable, and some dragon skeletons in particular tended to spawn halfway into the ground from time to time. A patch for the Xbox version of the game was released halfway through my reviewing process, so it's impossible to say how many of those issues (if any) would be mitigated by starting a new game with that patch applied. Within the boundaries of the game logic, NPCs occasionally act a little strangely in the way they move around the environment, in a manner that ought to be familiar to veterans of Bethesda's RPGs. Sometimes minor characters will wander between you and the character you're talking to, or walk up and loudly proclaim that they're training to be a blacksmith while a central story character is trying to get all expository. It's mostly harmless stuff, though it doesn't hurt to save often, since you can save anywhere. (It's nice that the game keeps your last three autosaves, so you'll never get stuck in a situation where you can't roll back if you end up in a fix.)<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">You'll probably have your own set of stories about the crazy things that happened during your many hours in Skyrim, including a horse fighting a dragon, and a conjurer who raised a slain chicken as her undead minion during a battle. Those both happened to me, by the way. Aside from the infrequent hard lockups and such, the oddities that tend to pop up in Bethesda's games have almost become part of the charm for me, though you know yourself how much those things detract from your own experience. But it hardly matters. No other game I know of operates with this many moving parts to create such an immense world filled with this much choice in how you engage its excellent, endless fiction. It's one thing when a game offers dozens of hours of gameplay; it's quite another when that gameplay is good enough you'll want to live in its world for that long.</p>", "deck": "Bethesda's latest, seemingly endless fantasy role-playing experience is unmissable, technical flaws be damned.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-443/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33394/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394/", "id": 33394, "name": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2011-11-10 05:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-105774/", "id": 105774, "name": "The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-review/1900-444/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1976416-zelda_skyward_1007_screen_42_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1976416\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5615763546798\" data-width=\"812\" style=\"width: 812px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1976416-zelda_skyward_1007_screen_42_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1976416\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1976416-zelda_skyward_1007_screen_42_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>An early boss brutally teaches you to avoid telegraphing attacks.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26934\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/3030-26934/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword\">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a> is <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a>\u2019s closing argument on motion controls with <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" slug=\"wii\">Wii</a>, especially as it relates to traditional games. It seems fitting that saving the world alongside Link will, for many of us, act as the first and last time we spend dozens of hours with a game inside our Wiis.</p><p style=\"\">And boy, how far we\u2019ve come. It takes only minutes with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19467\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess/3030-19467/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-twilight-princess\">Twilight Princess</a> again to understand how tacked on those motion mechanics were, and Skyward Sword\u2019s evolutionary leaps only compound the idea that we should have played Link\u2019s last adventure with a <a data-ref-id=\"3045-23\" href=\"/gamecube/3045-23/\" slug=\"gamecube\">GameCube</a> controller in both hands. How you come into Skyward Sword partially depends on how you took to Link the last time. Top to bottom, I found Twilight Princess painfully boring, which is, perhaps, a fate worse than bad. My reaction was fueled by a combined indifference to the game\u2019s uninspiring world, characters, and gadgets, and the tepid, half-hearted implementation of motion to make the mechanics more physical.</p><p style=\"\">Especially as it relates to the last point, Skyward Sword could not be more different. It\u2019s not just the added fidelity from <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3338\" href=\"/motion-plus-required/3015-3338/\" slug=\"motion-plus-required\">Motion Plus</a> that makes the difference, it\u2019s that your physical actions are truly meaningful when it comes to engaging in just about every combat scenario in Skyward Sword. The very first enemies in the game will beat your ass to the ground if you\u2019re not reading their moves, and Skyward Sword quickly teaches players that \u201cwaggle\u201d will not work here--period. To be successful in combat, reacting to the placement of each enemy\u2019s hands is of utmost importance, and while one becomes extremely adept at taking out the early combatants after a few hours, from start to finish, Skyward Sword asks much of your wrist. When the credits rolled, my hand ached, and it felt great.</p><p style=\"\">Combat never becomes difficult, but remains <i>challenging</i>, as you\u2019re constantly tasked with reacting to enemy actions (i.e. placing their sword to the left) with your own (i.e. slashing your sword to the right). Early on, the enemies are very blatant about showing weaknesses. That's less true later, forcing you to spend several failed encounters sussing out various \u201ctells.\" In one case, a lizard appears to be hiding its weak arm on the left, when in reality you must swing around from the right--a sleight of hand. Furthermore, for him to even show off that weak point, you must swing away a few times and force him into a defensive posture. The most satisfying encounters are when enemies swap tells over and over, asking players to be extraordinarily quick with a response, and this becomes more demanding over time. The game is always reading your sword in relation to the enemy, and if you telegraph an attack, enemies will smack back.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/107718/1909616-link.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909616\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.49507389162562\" data-width=\"812\" style=\"width: 812px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/107718/1909616-link.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1909616\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/107718/1909616-link.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Get to know your sword well, as it's basically a living companion.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Link\u2019s sword is front and center here, with only a few of the gadgets playing into combat. Mastery of the sword is of utmost importance. It\u2019s strange to spend so much time talking on and on about combat in a Zelda game, but it\u2019s no longer about smashing on the attack button anymore. Quite literally, you are <i>part</i> of combat, and motion controls, done well, provides a satisfaction that wouldn\u2019t be possible any other way. This is the finest example yet.</p><p style=\"\">One facet of modern games Nintendo\u2019s dodged is overcomplicated design, focusing on a simplicity that appeals to a larger audience. The Zelda series has always been described as an \u201caction RPG,\u201d but in light of what the RPG has become with games of immense depth like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33394\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394/\" slug=\"the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim\">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>, Zelda has become more RPG lite. And that\u2019s fine! Nintendo can contently stay in its corner, while <a data-ref-id=\"3010-786\" href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" slug=\"bethesda-softworks\">Bethesda</a> tackles another. But Skyward Sword takes steps to address the gap and falls short. The game includes a forgettable element of potion-<a data-ref-id=\"3015-934\" href=\"/crafting/3015-934/\" slug=\"crafting\">crafting</a> and item-upgrading, a case of good ideas that don\u2019t go far enough. Providing such a tiny amount of customization that\u2019s also built upon the same grinding mechanics of other crafting systems (prepare to catch lots of bugs, and read descriptions of what those bugs are every single time!) meant I only ended up upgrading when I just happened to have the right materials, and never bothered the rest of the game. It doesn\u2019t help that Skyward Sword\u2019s isn\u2019t particularly tough, which isn\u2019t outright a bad thing, but in the context of creating upgrade desire, not dying more than once or twice didn\u2019t create much motivation.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Some depth would have gone a long way here, especially if players could have any customization of Link's sword, the weapon he spends the most time with in the game. The sword's path is all story-driven, and that makes it difficult to forge a unique identity through upgrades. It ends up feeling like you\u2019re working way harder for upgrades that would have been found naturally in a dungeon in any other Zelda game.</p><p style=\"\">It\u2019s hard to overlook other areas where Skyward Sword doesn\u2019t play catch up, too. It\u2019s unacceptable now that Link doesn\u2019t have access to any catch-all quest log. Sure, the replacement for <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1176\" href=\"/navi/3005-1176/\" slug=\"navi\">Navi</a>, the robotic Fi, will provide you hints on where to go next, but that only relates to the primary goal, and she does not keep a database of side quests stumbled upon while exploring Skyloft. Characters have conversation icons above their heads if they have anything to say, but it\u2019s contingent upon you to either resolve a side quest when you encounter it, or make a note of and come back. Mostly, I just never came back.</p><p style=\"\">There\u2019s plenty to keep you busy, however. Even if you don\u2019t touch anything but the main storyline, Skyward Sword will take you well over 30 hours to complete, and if you want to see everything, that number could easily double. It\u2019s a packed journey, and while it\u2019s one that plays with some of the same tropes the series has become known for--Link, Zelda, evil, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-18\" href=\"/triforce/3055-18/\" slug=\"triforce\">Triforce</a>, forest, desert, volcano--the world of Skyloft, situated in the clouds, feels genuinely refreshing. What\u2019s old feels mostly new again, thanks largely to some truly devious, changing dungeon design. None of the dungeons are particularly long, there\u2019s not a single \u201cbad\u201d one, and the more active combat provides a welcomed contrast to puzzle barrage.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1976409-zelda_skyward_1007_screen_28_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1976409\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5615763546798\" data-width=\"812\" style=\"width: 812px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1976409-zelda_skyward_1007_screen_28_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1976409\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1976409-zelda_skyward_1007_screen_28_copy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1976409-zelda_skyward_1007_screen_28_copy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>When in doubt, take a deep breath and look around for clues.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">An early puzzle asks you to recreate a specific motion that wouldn\u2019t be possible without Motion Plus, and it took me over 20 minutes to come up with the solution, purely because I\u2019d never encountered something like it before. You\u2019re constantly doing new <i>everything</i> here, and it\u2019s the moments when the designers most daringly break from the past (ironic, given the game\u2019s \u201cbirth of a legend\u201d branding) that Skyward Sword makes the game worth playing, even if you\u2019ve grown tired of Zelda at this point. My favorite dungeons involved playing with time, where Link will move from room to room, switching between the past and the present to solve puzzles and avoid enemies. Creatures spawn in and out of reality in real-time, so rather than having to fight them, you can move time objects out of their vicinity--and poof! You\u2019re forced to think about the environment in entirely new ways, and ways that often don\u2019t feel very Zelda-like.</p><p style=\"\">And that\u2019s one of the weird things about playing a Zelda game, as it\u2019s impossible to play a Zelda game without acknowledging it exists in a large vacuum of other Zelda games. It\u2019s not unlike what has happened to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a>, in which many devoted players are simply looking for more Call of Duty, rather than a complete reinvention. Coming to terms with the latest game becomes a nostalgic balancing act of understanding the latest game in relation to itself, where it's come from and everything surrounding it.</p><p style=\"\">Skyward Sword doesn\u2019t do itself any favors in taking its sweet time getting started, and longer before introducing you to some of its most creative highlights. Designer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-614\" href=\"/shigeru-miyamoto/3040-614/\" slug=\"shigeru-miyamoto\">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> once said \u201cthe first 30 minutes of a game is the most important,\u201d and Skyward Sword fails to pass that test. It takes several hours before you\u2019re given any sense of real freedom, which is too bad, as the game manages to merge the sublime openness of the sea from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18508\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/3030-18508/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker\">Wind Waker</a> (without the Triforce madness!) with the directed fun of most other games, as it's easy to just keep moving forward without much fuss. And by the time you start seeing what the designers really have in store for you (wait until you get to the pirate section, where your boat is able to...well, you\u2019ll see), you actually don\u2019t want it to stop, even if you\u2019re able to constantly, cynically predict when the game will ask you to find just One More Thing before it's all over.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2010179-zeldaskywardsword102816.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2010179\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.565625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2010179-zeldaskywardsword102816.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2010179\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2010179-zeldaskywardsword102816.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2010179-zeldaskywardsword102816.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Good luck skydiving, one of the game's most frustrating bits.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps the most surprising disappointment is how little control players have over the game\u2019s central instrument, a harp. If you\u2019re going to call back to one of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time\">Ocarina of Time</a>\u2019s most memorable features within a game that makes such exquisite use of the new options afforded by Motion Plus, you\u2019d think the designers would come prepared with something altogether unique. That\u2019s not the case. Though Link learns several songs for the harp over the course of the game, you have no choice over which one to play, and playing anything involves haphazardly waving the Wii remote back and forth.</p><p style=\"\">Even in Skyward Sword\u2019s lowest of lows (don\u2019t get me started on a late sequence involving swimming underwater and collecting musical notes for 30 minutes), the game benefits from the prettiest art direction since Wind Waker. The game seamlessly transitions between various degrees of an impressionistic painting, based on where objects are in the foreground and background. And while I detest the meme \u201cit\u2019s good for a Wii game,\u201d at the point where we\u2019re beginning to gripe about the limitations of our high-definition consoles, it\u2019s a testament to the art direction that I immediately forgot the hardware's aging technology after a few minutes of play. Skyloft is an extraordinarily pretty place to explore.</p><p style=\"\">Skyward Sword is simultaneously a very good Zelda game and a rather great adventure game. It has some of the most inventive dungeons the series has ever known, sports the most impactful changes to the combat since <a data-ref-id=\"3015-416\" href=\"/lock-on/3015-416/\" slug=\"lock-on\">Z-targeting</a>, introduces wrinkles to the Zelda mythology that will force fans to rethink the entire series, and will have you gawking at it constantly, 480p 'n all. But the series finds itself facing an identity crisis, as it flirts with expanding what has defined the series without abandoning its charming but waning simplicity. Zelda doesn\u2019t need to become something else to maintain relevance, but at a certain point, when \u201ca brand-new great Zelda game\u201d isn\u2019t enough, there\u2019s reason to pause.</p>", "deck": "For mostly better and only a little bit worse, Skyward Sword is the best Zelda game in years, and makes a strong case for motion controls when done right.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-444/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26934/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword/3030-26934/", "id": 26934, "name": "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-11-11 03:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101735/", "id": 101735, "name": "The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword (Limited Music CD Edition)"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/saints-row-the-third-review/1900-445/", "description": "<p style=\"\">There was a time when you could reasonably call <a data-ref-id=\"3025-386\" href=\"/saints-row/3025-386/\" slug=\"saints-row\">Saints Row</a> just another <a data-ref-id=\"3025-6\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto\">Grand Theft Auto</a> clone.

Not in sense of humor, mind you (very much the contrary there), but simply in confidence, wisdom, and overall comfort in being very much its own thing. Whatever similarities Saints Row: The Third might have to the GTA series at this point are purely mechanical. In truth, it has more in common with the imaginary game every obnoxious parent group, pandering state senator, and hack activist lawyer <i>believed</i> Grand Theft Auto was during those tumultuous <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7120\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto-san-andreas/3030-7120/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto-san-andreas\">San Andreas</a> years. It's Grand Theft Auto filtered through the mind of a fucking lunatic, pushed to boundaries of ludicrousness that make things like giant dildo clubs and man-launching cannons seem altogether reasonable compared with much of the other batshit nonsense going on in here. In a sense, Volition has succeeded in making the mayhem and murder simulator that Rockstar never even tried to make in the first place, and it's hard to argue that we, the video gaming public, aren't better off for it.</p><p style=\"\">Whereas Saints Row 2 had a bit of trouble marrying its plot to the previous edition of the game, Saints Row: The Third defeats that problem by simply refusing to care. Yes, there is a story involving your gang (the titular Saints) and an encroaching United Nations of gang violence from a nearby town called Steelport. Headed up by a Karl Lagerfeld-esque Belgian dandy and a pair of twin sisters in turtlenecks (at least one of whom is voiced by former porn actress and now sort-of real actress <a data-ref-id=\"3040-100738\" href=\"/sasha-grey/3040-100738/\" slug=\"sasha-grey\">Sasha Grey</a>), the Saints are delivered an ultimatum: turn over 66% of their profits to the evil Syndicate, or get smoked. Unsurprisingly, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1484\" href=\"/johnny-gat/3005-1484/\" slug=\"johnny-gat\">Johnny Gat</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8327\" href=\"/shaundi/3005-8327/\" slug=\"shaundi\">Shaundi</a>, and your own nameless \"boss\" character aren't having that, leading to an insane gunfight inside of a cargo plane flying over Steelport that results in multiple bouts of shooting while parachuting, at least one sequence involving crashing through the windshield of the aforementioned plane just to shoot one dude, and a few pleasantly racist Belgian jokes.</p><p style=\"\">All of that, plus a delightfully in-jokey bank robbery sequence inside of the opening 30 minutes. There is plot explained in there somewhere, but most of it is lost amid the genuinely funny throwaway one-liners and endless gobs of insane action thrown directly at your eye sockets. And if you have any intention of playing through all of Saints Row's various story and side missions, you've got about 16 more hours of that kind of crazy coming your way, multiplied by several orders of magnitude.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">I'm not trying to dismiss Saints Row's story out of hand--it just isn't important in the grand scheme of things.

There's a number of good parodies of annoying video game tropes over the last few years (the modern war on terror, and zombies, just to name a couple), not to mention a few older ones (it's best if you discover those for yourself). But understanding of the plot isn't a requirement toward enjoying Saints Row: The Third. It doesn't matter if you've ever played one of these games before. All that matters is that you enjoy unadulterated chaos--specifically, causing lots of it.</p><p style=\"\">Saints Row: The Third is generally at its best when you're blowing up, shooting, or delivering running clotheslines to just about anything. As an open world, Steelport is probably the worst place you could possibly live in America, what with the preponderance of purple-clad assholes running around dropkicking you in the back of the head and beating your skull in with depressingly over-sized dildos. The sheer variety of stupid, <i>stupid</i> weaponry Volition has laid at your feet in this game is nothing short of a gift for destruction junkies everywhere. Ever wanted to explode a bad guy into a cloud of bloody vapor with a single blast of a sonic boom? Ever had the itch to incinerate random citizens with a futuristic laser/flamethrower shot from a goddamn future jet? Ever said to yourself, \"Man, beating people with my fists is awesome, but wouldn't it be so much more awesome if they exploded for absolutely no reason when I did it?\" Then friends, does Volition ever have a video game for you.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/1994624-uifp5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994624\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/1994624-uifp5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1994624\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/1994624-uifp5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You may take over the city, but make no mistake: In Saints Row: The Third, it's chaos that reigns.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">One of the best things about Saints Row: The Third is that it actually manages to fuse the incoherent violence into its story remarkably well. Story missions, as well as many of the various side ventures, actually require you to lay waste to all that stands before you, only this time it's with a purpose, and not just for morbid giggles. Mayhem missions, insurance fraud (where you essentially turn yourself into the human version of the Showtime mode from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5648\" href=\"/burnout-paradise/3030-5648/\" slug=\"burnout-paradise\">Burnout Paradise</a>), and helicopter assaults all play directly into your takeover of Steelport while also being completely bonkers.</p><p style=\"\">Story missions obviously have a bit more structure to them, but are no less insane for it. The writers at Volition have done a great job beefing up Steelport's rival gangs into ridiculous, out-sized caricatures that not only deserve the hot blasts of dildo-oriented death coming their way, but also lend themselves to particularly great boss fights and specialized levels that range from <a data-ref-id=\"3025-258\" href=\"/tron/3025-258/\" slug=\"tron\">TRON</a>-esque cyberspace battles to a straight-up pay-per-view wrestling match that's...well, again, it's better if you discover it for yourself.</p><p style=\"\">Even outside of missions, every piece of terrible destruction you rain down on the citizens of Steelport contributes to your respect meter, which is more or less your earned experience throughout the game. Leveling up unlocks new bonuses that range from simple ability upgrades, to gang-oriented bonuses that earn you more cash and/or respect. Cash lets you upgrade additional things, like your various strongholds around the city, as well as your weaponry. You'll definitely want to, as the upgraded guns are far more fun than the base-level ones. You ain't lived until you've juggled a lifeless corpse in upwards of 30 seconds with your level four dual-wielded silver pistols.</p><p style=\"\">Volition touts Saints Row: The Third as its most ambitious game, both technically and from a gameplay perspective, and in truth, the end product shows exactly that. Without getting too tech-speaky about it, The Third is easily the best-<i>feeling</i> Saints Row game yet, and arguably one of the best-feeling open world games I've ever played. The combat is remarkably tight, both in gunplay and in melee combat. I often find melee combat in games like this a terrible afterthought, but here it's actually a delight. Vehicles also feel pretty great, mixing absurd physics with a relatively tight handling that makes driving around Steelport a joy, rather than an abject chore.</p><p style=\"\">That said, not everything on the technical side works quite as it should. Saints Row: The Third is not devoid of bugs, even after installing an early patch on consoles. Crash bugs during loading screens I experienced effectively stopped after the patch, but glitches during missions continued to pop up, especially during side missions after restarting them. On a few occasions, enemy/compatriot AI would simply cease to function, allowing me to just kill a bunch of dudes without even trying. Elsewhere, I ran into a pair of weird instances where the game's world streaming simply ceased, and I found my character dropping through roads into some kind of abyssal void where world textures and nothingness combined into a kind of modernist hodgepodge of crashy craziness. The good news is that Saints Row: The Third autosaves often, so you rarely lose much progress when stuff like this occurs. And hey, if you're the sort that finds these kinds of glitches <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9l_YN-yRCVY\" rel=\"nofollow\">the video game equivalent of performance art</a>, you're in for a treat.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2006261-5691sr3_furries_gone_wild_10062011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2006261\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/49445/2006261-5691sr3_furries_gone_wild_10062011.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2006261\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2006261-5691sr3_furries_gone_wild_10062011.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/49445/2006261-5691sr3_furries_gone_wild_10062011.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>No words. None.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I haven't even gotten into the multiplayer aspects of Saints Row: The Third yet, largely because they're the least-compelling facets of the game. Competitive multiplayer is pretty much out altogether, and in its place comes the Whored Mode. Awful, <i>awful</i> title aside, this is essentially the Horde mode from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12231\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3030-12231/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War</a>, with waves of zombies, luchadores, sexy nuns, weaponized furries, and whatever the hell else coming at you in various rounds of combat. It's a perfectly fine distraction that can be played online or locally with friends, but it's not really the sort of thing you'll keep coming back to long after the campaign is complete. Instead, you might opt to go back and play through the campaign again in co-op. This works functionally as it did in SR2, and despite the fact that the story never really acknowledges that there are now two players instead of one, it's still great to blow things up alongside a friend.</p><p style=\"\">With all of these things in mind, I respect that Saints Row: The Third might not be a game for everyone. Specifically, those who do not find joy in the act of inflicting terrible, fiery, dildo-y pain on whatever innocent polygonal creature happens to wander too close to their personal blast zone will probably not get much out of Saints Row's unrelenting dedication to preposterous anarchy. It is a game specifically designed for annihilation junkies, those who can embrace the idea of an infantile playground of seemingly infinite obliterative pleasures. For those who prefer their games a tad less absurdly--perhaps <i>needlessly-</i>-violent, any number of other games this fall will likely suit your fancy just fine.</p><p style=\"\">As for the rest of us?

It's not that it's a poorly made game or anything--it's actually a great-looking, colorful game that controls well and makes good use of its platform's unique 3D abilities. It's just that it was easy to a fault, almost like it was made primarily for people who don't play a lot of video games. Most of my deaths in the first few worlds came from my own carelessness rather than any sort of tricky gameplay. But just as I was starting to get bored, the game started ramping up. So don't be alarmed by its slow start. Between some tricky moments in the later worlds and a whole \"second quest\" sort of situation that opens up once World 8 is complete, Super Mario 3D Land handily overcomes its early game doldrums and turns into a more engaging set of levels.</p><p style=\"\">Hey guys, spoiler warning over here, but <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">Bowser</a> has kidnapped the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">Princess</a> again. Crazy, I know. That's the only real impetus you'll get to go traipsing through another set of decidedly <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1\" href=\"/mario/3025-1/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a>-esque levels, but by this point, that's more than enough. The level design is what's truly special. Though you can run in any direction with full analog control, the game works from a set of fixed camera perspectives that, at times, look like the old 2D sidescrollers with a little bit of Z-axis movement in them. Occasionally you'll get a top-down view of the action, which enables the developers to create a quick homage to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11949\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3030-11949/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda\">The Legend of Zelda</a>. And some spots play around with perspective as it relates to the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-117\" href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" slug=\"nintendo-3ds\">3DS</a>' 3D abilities by placing platforms in spots that would look easily reachable if your 3D slider is turned all the way down, but when you flip it up to 3D, you'll catch that things aren't quite what they seem. It's worth noting that, in these specific cases, the game has a platform you can stand on that rotates the room a bit so you can see the illusion for what it is--useful if you're unable to process the 3D at all. The levels span the typical assortment of lava levels, fields, underwater zones, and the like, and they bring back enemies and concepts from more than a few different old Mario games. You'll see some <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16094\" href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3030-16094/\" slug=\"super-mario-galaxy\">Super Mario Galaxy</a> in here, but you'll also try to hop on top of a flagpole at the end of nearly every level, just like the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15544\" href=\"/super-mario-bros/3030-15544/\" slug=\"super-mario-bros\">Super Mario Bros.</a> did.</p><p style=\"\">The optional-but-not-really-optional goal for each level is, once again, to collect three star coins along the way. Some of these are plainly visible and easily accessible. Others are stashed away behind secret walls that you might only find if you're really paying attention or running behind objects in the world as you search through every little area you can think of. Later on, they just start to get devious. I've always been more of a fan of the Super Mario World-style secret exit concept than any of this coin business, but they both serve a similar purpose by getting you to do more than blast through every level as quickly as possible. Some optional levels have coin requirements, and you'll need 100 coins to see the game's first \"final level.\" The second set of eight worlds that opens up afterwards has even higher requirements. At some point, this means you'll probably have to return to earlier levels to mop up some stars you ignored the first time around. If you're a completionist, you'll probably enjoy that aspect of the game. For me, I mostly just wanted to see the exciting new levels and the harder twists on existing levels, so the backtracking was a real momentum-killer.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1972414-3dssupermario3dlandoct618.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1972414\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:120.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1972414-3dssupermario3dlandoct618.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1972414\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/13/135472/1972414-3dssupermario3dlandoct618.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The bottom screen lets you get at a stored item.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game makes the most of a few buttons, using one to jump, another to run and shoot <a data-ref-id=\"3055-120\" href=\"/fireball/3055-120/\" slug=\"fireball\">fireballs</a> (or <a data-ref-id=\"3055-76\" href=\"/boomerang/3055-76/\" slug=\"boomerang\">boomerangs</a>... or spin your <a data-ref-id=\"3055-38\" href=\"/tanooki-suit/3055-38/\" slug=\"tanooki-suit\">tanooki</a> tail), and a trigger for butt stomps and crouching. This version of Mario doesn't punch or kick, but he can wall jump or crouch to charge up higher backflip jumps, giving you more than enough mobility to handle your business. The tanooki suit gives you the ability to flip your tail for a gentle glide, which is great for simply drifting over obstacles instead of dealing with them directly. If you run into a level that's too tough for you, a golden tanooki suit will appear at your respawn point, and this makes you invincible to everything other than falling off of a level. Think of this as your \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-4045\" href=\"/super-guide/3015-4045/\" slug=\"super-guide\">Super Guide</a>\" equivalent. It's... kind of useful in a few levels. No shame over here. Look, I used it a few times, just for the review, OK? Stop <i>judging</i> me! Point being, the control is tight in the ways you'd expect from a Mario game.</p><p style=\"\">The game makes good use of the 3D effects both in its level design and with a few little camera tricks that remind you \"hey, this is in 3D, remember?\" The camera tricks are things like caves that have you heading back into the background of a stage, only to be chased out by a sea monster that's swimming directly at the camera. Fire blasts that pop up out of the lava and launch platforms into the air also look really great, and the 3D provides you with information that isn't conveyed quite as well in 2D. Yup, it's a game that wouldn't be quite as cool anywhere else. The audio is also warm and memorable in that classic Mario way. You'll get a lot of remixes of existing material, and most of it's great. I thought the remix of the \"you got a star and dude, you're totally invincible now\" music was kind of weak.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Everyone seems to keep asking if this is the game that makes the 3DS worth owning, as if they're waiting for one single game to send them off to the store so they can invest in a new platform.

True to series form, Origins' dialogue and storytelling plays second banana to the gameplay and visuals. There's stuff involving nymphs, collectable Electoons, and a bunch of angry monsters, but truth be told, none of it really matters. The dialogue is still made up largely of gibberish with occasionally helpful subtitles, and really, all you need to know is that Rayman's on a mission, and many a jerk chicken, cantankerous fish, and malcontent monster will suffer should they get in his way.</p><p style=\"\">And they do. Often, in fact. To combat these vile forces that have imprisoned those smiling, cooing Electoons (they're basically purple dots with faces and ponytails), Rayman will need a smorgasbord of different abilities to best them, ranging from wall-running to deep-sea diving, with plenty of standard combat in-between.</p><p style=\"\">One of the smarter decisions Origins' designers made was to space out the period between acquiring these abilities. The first five worlds each tend to revolve around a specific ability, whereas the remaining worlds after tend to utilize them all willy-nilly. It gives you ample time with each new mechanic before giving you a series of levels that force you to use several of them at once in rapid succession. Trust me when I say it balances out the challenge in a way that becomes sorely necessary as the game goes along.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's weird to say it, but Origins is easily one of the more challenging platformers I've played in a good long while. Note that I did not say \"difficult\" or \"hard,\" but rather \"challenging.\" Toward the end of the game, things do get quite difficult, but by the time you get there, you've already bested so many different obstacles and crazy, timing-based levels that you pretty much know what you're in store for. It's an immaculately-paced campaign that builds you up bit by bit before throwing the hammer down on the player. Moments of frustration are there, especially in some of the treasure hunting side levels, where you're forced to chase a runaway treasure chest while navigating obstacles purely on adrenaline and reflex, leading to more trial-and-error than one might prefer.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864418-rohdgcfloatingfun.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864418\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864418-rohdgcfloatingfun.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864418\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864418-rohdgcfloatingfun.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Provided your cohorts are up to the challenge, co-op is definitely the way to play.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Then again, trial-and-error is kind of platforming 101, alongside double-jumping, cartoonish bad guys, and levels that revolve around lava, ice, water, and jungles. Origins has all of those things too, but I assure you it uses them with greater creativity than most other genre forebears. Each level in Rayman: Origins feels painstakingly crafted and unique. Yes, certain mechanics and pitfalls are used mutliple times throughout the game, but no two levels ever feel like a riff on one another. There is this great sense of variety as each world opens up, and that feeling never tapers off.</p><p style=\"\">It also bears mention that Origins' control scheme is damn near perfect. Nothing kills a platformer like unresponsive controls, or mechanics that are too difficult to pull off. Ubisoft's Montpelier team has found a fantastic balance of goofy animation and moves that are responsive and generally pretty easy to pull off. Sure, you might periodically mis-time a wall jump or inadvertently overshoot a platform, but thankfully, the game's checkpoint system is exceptionally good at making sure you don't have to traverse a million previously bested traps over again, thus keeping frustration at a minimum.</p><p style=\"\">The only downside to Origins' general challenge level is that it makes it tough to stop and take in the scenery. You'll want to, as Rayman: Origins is about as beautiful a 2D platformer as I've ever seen. The game's art style is as close to an interactive cartoon as we've seen to date, with phenomenal, hand-painted-looking character and world art that blends seamlessly across multiple art styles. The moments you do get to take in are often hilarious and transfixing, goofy and gorgeous all at once. While you might periodically wish for the game to slow down a moment and let you soak it all in, odds are you'll be having too much fun to really care.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1800890-ss_preview_0016_raymanorigins16.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800890\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1800890-ss_preview_0016_raymanorigins16.jpg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800890\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57793/1800890-ss_preview_0016_raymanorigins16.jpg.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57793/1800890-ss_preview_0016_raymanorigins16.jpg.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Even when it's trying to be ugly, Rayman: Origins looks beautiful.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Odds are your friends will be too, should you opt to include them in on the fun. Co-op play for up to four players is available, and though the levels don't alter with additional players, the game experience most certainly does. Adding additional players definitely ups the frantic factor by a significant margin, albeit not in a detrimental way. The co-op mode is simply a laugh riot, full of unexpected silliness and absurd attacks that often involve screwing with your friends as much as helping them.

Brotherhood allayed these concerns with meaningful additions to both the gameplay and the story, and a general sense of cohesion that you might not expect from a game of such scope turned around in just one year\u2019s time. Now we have <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34975\" href=\"/assassins-creed-revelations/3030-34975/\" slug=\"assassins-creed-revelations\">Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations</a>, the third game in the series in as many years. The production values are as strong as ever, and it retains most of the tricks that kept Brotherhood from feeling like an also-ran, like the ability to build your own assassin\u2019s guild and a surprisingly engaging suite of multiplayer modes. The additions Revelations makes on top of those features, though, don\u2019t feel quite as essential to the experience, sometimes adding complication just for the sake of it. Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations, the name alone, suggests a certain amount of closure, but the greater Assassin\u2019s Creed story feels like it\u2019s starting to spin its wheels.</span></p><p style=\"\">Let me just say right now, if you\u2019re not current with the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-38\" href=\"/assassins-creed/3025-38/\" slug=\"assassins-creed\">Assassin\u2019s Creed</a> series, or if this would be your first Assassin\u2019s Creed game, you should probably stop reading here and get yourself caught up. Though it tries gamely with a quick-cut \u201cpreviously on...\u201d montage to get folks up to speed, the story of Revelations is so intrinsically tied to the previous games that it makes for a series introduction that\u2019s confusing at best. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-305\" href=\"/desmond-miles/3005-305/\" slug=\"desmond-miles\">Desmond Miles,</a> the seemingly mild-mannered bartender whose genetic memory has been the stage for the Assassin\u2019s Creed series up to now, is in a bad way after the events of Brotherhood. Left catatonic, with his mind fragmented between his own experiences, and those of his ancestors <a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"/altair/3005-48/\" slug=\"altair\">Altair</a> and Ezio Auditore, Miles has been jacked back into the Animus as a sort of mental life support. Inside the Animus loading program he meets Subject 16, or at least what\u2019s left of him, who lays out the plot pretty simply: Desmond needs to see Ezio and Alta\u00efr's stories to their conclusion if he ever hopes to wake up.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1859084-acr_mp_sc_05_antioch_wanted.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859084\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1859084-acr_mp_sc_05_antioch_wanted.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859084\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1859084-acr_mp_sc_05_antioch_wanted.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Templars come in all shapes and sizes.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Even though the entirety of Revelations takes place inside Desmond\u2019s mind, he\u2019s barely a guest star here, with the focus primarily on Ezio, and, to a lesser extent, Alta\u00efr. There is a peculiar set of optional side levels--abstract, awkward, first-person puzzles--you can load up from inside the Animus that offer some insight into Desmond\u2019s back story, albeit in a shockingly dry, casual manner. Most of the time, though, you\u2019re playing as Ezio, now a bearded, weathered old man, whose dogged campaign against the Templars has led him to Constantinople, where he hopes to find a set of five keys necessary to open Alta\u00efr\u2019s library back in Masyaf before the Templars do. There are major subplots in Constantinople concerning political maneuvering within the local Sultan\u2019s family, as well as Ezio\u2019s growing affection for a local book dealer who is assisting him in his search, but other than the typical, largely anonymous Templar forces working against him, there\u2019s not much of a central conflict here--just a task that needs doing.</p><p style=\"\">The keys to Alta\u00efr\u2019s library, it just so happens, are made from the same material as the Apple of Eden, and with each key Ezio finds, he\u2019s given a brief glimpse into Alta\u00efr\u2019s life. (This means that Desmond\u2019s experiences as Alta\u00efr here are twice removed, though the game never gets all <i>Inception</i> with exploring the layering of reality.) Unlike Ezio, who has the full run of Constantinople, the episodes where you play as Alta\u00efr are highly constrained, taking place almost exclusively in and around the guild castle at Masyaf from the first Assassin\u2019s Creed. These sequences aren\u2019t much to play, and though they provide some insight into snippets of Alta\u00efr\u2019s life after the events of Assassin\u2019s Creed, their implications for the fiction at large seem limited. Yes, we know more about Alta\u00efr\u2019s family and his turbulent relationship with his guild, but it all goes by so quickly that it\u2019s hard to get terribly invested. Generally speaking, Revelations is more interested in filling in back story than it is in maintaining forward momentum. There is an ironic paucity of revelations in Revelations.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1859086-acr_mp_sc_09_constantinople.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859086\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1859086-acr_mp_sc_09_constantinople.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859086\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1859086-acr_mp_sc_09_constantinople.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1859086-acr_mp_sc_09_constantinople.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\"Dude, let go of my fannypack!\"</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It\u2019s much easier to like Revelations if you\u2019re not here for the story, as the fundamental action of dynamic urban traversal and timing-based combat that\u2019s both lightning-quick and thick with arterial spray still feels terrific. With a few, minor exceptions--like the ubiquity of horses--Revelations brings back nearly all of the bells and whistles that helped make Brotherhood so good, such as the ability to cultivate your own assassin\u2019s guild, send assassins out on international assignments, buy up local business for added income, take over Templar strongholds, and take on missions for the local mercenaries and thieves guilds.</p><p style=\"\">On top of all this, Revelations piles on a few of its own systems. Ezio has had one of his standard hidden blades replaced with a locally sourced hookblade, which mostly just makes climbing up sheer buildings a bit faster and allows you to make use of Constantinople\u2019s plentiful, conspicuous ziplines, though it also serves some minor combat and evasion purposes. The combat generally still moves at the same bracing speed as it did in Brotherhood, though you\u2019ll eventually encounter enemies that require slightly more strategy and patience to take down--assuming you don\u2019t just call in your guildmates to finish them off for you. Ezio also gets introduced to the craft of bomb-making, which allows you to combine different types of reagents you find, buy, or steal for different explosive results, which I regularly found quite handy.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Revelations makes a certain effort to unify some of its disparate systems, though by creating interdependencies between the assassin\u2019s dens you establish in Constantinople, Ezio\u2019s current \u201cheat\u201d level with the Templars, and the experience levels of the assassins you\u2019ve been training, it\u2019s more difficult for you to dabble in one while ignoring the others. Basically, if you don\u2019t protect your dens, the Templars can try and steal them back. In order to retain control, you have to play through what is essentially a brief tower defense scenario, placing different types of assassins on rooftops and barriers in the streets to fend off waves of Templar attackers. Or, if you find the tower defense stuff as tedious as I did, you just let the Templars take over, then just sweep back in, murder the Templar captain, and take control again.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1859083-acr_mp_sc_06_constantinople.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859083\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1859083-acr_mp_sc_06_constantinople.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1859083\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1859083-acr_mp_sc_06_constantinople.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1859083-acr_mp_sc_06_constantinople.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Sooner or later, everyone gets stabbed.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If there's one area that Revelations makes some unequivocal improvements over Brotherhood is in the multiplayer, which features more maps, more modes, more playable characters, and more customization options as you level up. Subtle tweaks make it easier to defend against an attacker, and the choice in certain modes to remove the directional radar in favor of a simpler, less explicit proximity meter means you have to pay closer attention to make sure the person you're following is your intended target. If there's a critique, it's that some of the modes can seem a little complicated at first blush, though a training room allows you to familiarize yourself without drawing the ire of Internet Teens.</p><p style=\"\">For the most part, what was great about Assassin\u2019s Creed: Brotherhood is still good in Assassin\u2019s Creed: Revelations, but the new stuff doesn\u2019t do much to improve the experience, and all the best moments just feel kind of familiar. Even though the game takes place in an entirely new city, the old-world aesthetic isn\u2019t that radically different. This is probably overstating the shortcomings of Revelations, but when I finished the game I was left concerned about the future of the Assassin\u2019s Creed franchise. Ubisoft seems completely intent on making Assassin\u2019s Creed an annual franchise, and at this rate, I\u2019m afraid it will have exhausted its goodwill before we get to see a proper Assassin\u2019s Creed III.</p>", "deck": "The laws of diminishing returns have started to affect Assassin\u2019s Creed, and while Revelations doesn\u2019t quite live up to the promise of its subtitle, there\u2019s still plenty to like about what may be Ezio Auditore\u2019s final adventure.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-448/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-34975/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed-revelations/3030-34975/", "id": 34975, "name": "Assassin's Creed: Revelations"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-11-15 19:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-112611/", "id": 112611, "name": "Assassin's Creed: Revelations"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/need-for-speed-the-run-review/1900-449/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/1989413-el_camino_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1989413\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5525641025641\" data-width=\"780\" style=\"width: 780px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/56742/1989413-el_camino_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1989413\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/56742/1989413-el_camino_1.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">At the center of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34943\" href=\"/need-for-speed-the-run/3030-34943/\" slug=\"need-for-speed-the-run\">Need for Speed: The Run</a> is a fantastic idea. Maybe it's just because I've always been a big <i>Cannonball Run</i> fan, but the mere thought of a cross-country race is enough to get me going. So with that in mind, it probably wouldn't surprise you to hear that I was kind of pulling for The Run. But it's disappointing on almost every level. Aside from some occasionally nice graphics and audio, there aren't too many worthwhile things to be found in this year's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-483\" href=\"/need-for-speed/3025-483/\" slug=\"need-for-speed\">Need for Speed</a>. It squanders its terrific concept by saddling it with poor handling, insanely inconsistent off-road and crash behaviors, and straightforward, race-only multiplayer that isn't good enough to keep you coming back. If you want to play this type of light, arcade-like driving game, stick to last year's <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31698\" href=\"/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/3030-31698/\" slug=\"need-for-speed-hot-pursuit\">Hot Pursuit</a>.</p><p style=\"\">The setup for your cross-country race has you playing a driver named Jack. On the run from the mob, Jack needs to win this big race earn a high-enough stack of money to make those problems vanish. He starts in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-191\" href=\"/san-francisco/3035-191/\" slug=\"san-francisco\">San Francisco</a> and the race takes you through <a data-ref-id=\"3035-78\" href=\"/las-vegas/3035-78/\" slug=\"las-vegas\">Las Vegas</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-293\" href=\"/chicago/3035-293/\" slug=\"chicago\">Chicago</a>, and plenty of other rural points as you try to beat over 200 other racers to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-109\" href=\"/new-york-city/3035-109/\" slug=\"new-york-city\">New York City</a>. But this isn't just some kind of crazy endurance run. Instead, the action is broken up into 10 stages, which are broken up further into specific events. In some cases you'll need to pass eight or nine racers before getting to the end of the section. In others you'll just be racing against a clock to \"make up time.\" This makes the game incredibly linear and static, because if you don't complete those tasks, you'll have to retry that leg of the trip until you get it right. So when your female benefactor says you'll need to hit 50th place by the time you hit Chicago, you can be sure that you'll make it there... even though the story doesn't really say anything about needing to hit those milestones for, like, race rules purposes. It's contrived, but it's contrived in a way that at least serves the game by giving you a variety of things to do as you race.</p><p style=\"\">The game also gins up ways to move you from one class of cars into a faster class by adding a few <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">Quick Time Event</a> sequences to the action. These normally happen in big cities, and they'll have you wrecking your car, running away from angry cops, jumping across rooftops, and stuff like that. It's a little silly because the cutscenes playing on the screen look pretty nice, but you'll be too busy staring at the little button prompts to notice. At the end of these sequences, you'll steal or find a new, faster car to continue on. Gas stations littered along the side of some tracks also give you opportunities to get into different vehicles, in case you aren't gelling with your current ride.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1862990-nfsrunindependencepass7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862990\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1862990-nfsrunindependencepass7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862990\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1862990-nfsrunindependencepass7.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">Cars are broken up into tiers to keep similar vehicles together, but they're also given different handling types, like \"easy,\" or \"challenging.\" In my experience, none of the cars feel particularly good. The easy and normal cars feel like they're stuck in the mud, incredibly stiff-steering, and weirdly auto-correcting. Dodging oncoming traffic on a straightaway becomes difficult because the controls simply don't feel responsive enough. The harder handling vehicles don't seem to actually correct this, either. Instead, those cars just get a bit more squirrely around curves, making it a little easier to drift around turns in some cases, but generally just making the driving feel underwhelming in a different way. EIther way, most of the game isn't especially challenging once you get used to the particular quirks in its handling models, though a few events throw curves at you that spike the difficulty in weird ways. When you're running from the mob, who are pursuing you through <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1309\" href=\"/cleveland/3035-1309/\" slug=\"cleveland\">Cleveland</a> with two suspiciously fast SUVs and a helicopter, you'll get shot at from all sides, forcing you to swerve around in vehicles that don't swerve particularly well as you try to weave your way through a track that seems to be exploding around you. The game offers the helpful tip of \"avoid gunfire,\" but that sequence sort of felt more like luck to me. The constant rubber band AI from your opposition, which keeps everyone close to you at almost all times, certainly didn't help.</p><p style=\"\">The Run's 10 stages will probably take most players between two and three hours of time, from the leaderboard's perspective. That time doesn't include resets and time spent looking at menus, so it's a bit longer than that, but it doesn't feel especially substantial. Despite there being some great little moments, like the dusky sky as you're leaving Las Vegas or the cracks of thunder and lightning as you blast through South Dakota, I can't say I saw too many reasons to go back. The game does fill every nook and cranny with Autolog leaderboards and race recommendations, but when the core game doesn't hold up, fighting over positions with your friends sounds kind of pointless. As you clear out the main mode, tracks are opening up in a \"challenge series\" mode that gives you medals and other unlockables to earn. Again, this would be a better proposition if the game was more interesting on its own.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1972486-ontheedgeenvironmentnowm_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1972486\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1972486-ontheedgeenvironmentnowm_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1972486\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1972486-ontheedgeenvironmentnowm_03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1972486-ontheedgeenvironmentnowm_03.jpg\"></noscript></a></figure><p style=\"\">Lastly the game has multiplayer, and this breaks the tracks up into several different playlists and builds three-race sessions out of the existing tracks. Up to eight players can race and, well, that's about it. You'll earn <a data-ref-id=\"3015-39\" href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" slug=\"experience-points\">XP</a> and build your persistent level, granting you more unlocks along the way, but the simple race style doesn't get much better when you throw in seven other players. The game already has a jarring problem with the way it handles off-road driving, as it seems to be overly sensitive about when it forces you to reset back onto the track. Marked shortcuts? Those are just fine. Cut a hairpin turn a little too close and get off the road a bit? Forced reset. Fly off the road around a turn? Sometimes it's totally fine and you'll be able to recover. Sometimes the screen simply fades to black and drops you back onto the track. Offline, this digs into your limited reserve of resets. Online it happens a bit faster but with unpredictable results. I managed to bump another human player off the road. We both respawned, but for some reason I respawned faster, letting me easily take the lead with no skill whatsoever. The whole system feels completely arbitrary, which is exactly the sort of thing you don't want to see in a competitive multiplayer game.</p><p style=\"\">While there's certainly a great idea at the core of the experience, Need for Speed: The Run instead comes off like some kind of tragedy. The end may set up for a direct sequel to The Run, but unless that's going to include a complete overhaul of every single system, I can't imagine anyone wanting to see that come to fruition. It's a shame, too, because after years of slowly floundering, last year's Need for Speed breathed new life into the long-running franchise.

Today, that campaign feels like equal parts modern shooter and nostalgia trip. The durable \"combat puzzle\" aspect of Halo's gameplay hasn't fundamentally changed throughout the course of the franchise, largely because <a data-ref-id=\"3010-476\" href=\"/bungie/3010-476/\" slug=\"bungie\">Bungie</a> pretty much got it right the first time. Halo's diverse mix of the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-175\" href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" slug=\"master-chief\">Master Chief</a>'s traditional human weapons and the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-81\" href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" slug=\"the-covenant\">Covenant</a>'s more exotic, energy-based arsenal gives you a great range of options for approaching different combat scenarios, and it's still a treat to change up your tactics on the higher difficulties and see a real difference in your performance, especially since you can count on the game to play out differently every time you reload a checkpoint. That unpredictable interplay of enemy behavior and strategic options is just as exciting in this remake as it ever was, especially with two players in co-op on Heroic or Legendary. The challenge at that level is no slouch.</p><p style=\"\">At least, that all holds true when you're fighting the Covenant, who take cover and use other tactics to keep you guessing. They're worthy adversaries. But fighting the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-645\" href=\"/the-flood/3015-645/\" slug=\"the-flood\">Flood</a> hasn't gotten any more fun in the last 10 years, since they act with no self-preservation and just run mindlessly at you, like they're straight out of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\" href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" slug=\"doom\">Doom</a>. That's directly counter to what makes Halo's combat great, and it's telling that you saw less and less of the Flood in each subsequent Halo game until you saw none at all. The infamously long and drab Library level is also unchanged, and fighting hordes of Flood ganging up on me in there really tried my patience. But Anniversary isn't about making the Halo campaign better or more modern. It's almost like a museum piece, meant to preserve the original experience in as pure a form as possible.</p><p style=\"\">In that sense, it's novel to play Anniversary and remember some of those specific attributes of that first game that have changed over the years in subsequent releases. Remember when you couldn't hijack vehicles or use <a data-ref-id=\"3055-115\" href=\"/energy-sword/3055-115/\" slug=\"energy-sword\">energy swords</a>? On the flip side, you can run around holding a full charge in your <a data-ref-id=\"3055-119\" href=\"/plasma-pistol/3055-119/\" slug=\"plasma-pistol\">plasma pistol</a> for as long as you want, and that beast of a default pistol is in here, ready to dispense <a data-ref-id=\"3015-85\" href=\"/headshot/3015-85/\" slug=\"headshot\">headshots</a> with gusto. Down to the last detail, this is the campaign you remember. The only additions are 360 achievements--some of which offer some neat level-specific challenges--and collectible terminals and campaign skulls. Both of those are well hidden; you'll have to pull off painful grenade jumps to get to some of the best skulls, and the terminals are often located off the beaten path as well. Each terminal is accompanied by a decent little motion graphic with voiceover that provides some additional backstory for the series. Some of the terminal videos are probably dropping <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35533\" href=\"/halo-4/3030-35533/\" slug=\"halo-4\">Halo 4</a> hints as well, though it's impossible to say for sure what any of it means for the future just yet.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2061198-hcea_pillar_autumn_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2061198\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2304\" style=\"width: 2304px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2061198-hcea_pillar_autumn_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2061198\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2061198-hcea_pillar_autumn_3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hey, Captain Keyes! I remember that guy!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Other aspects of the campaign make Halo: CE's age glaringly apparent. Some segments of the game's level design were noticeably repetitive even when it was new, and that repetition sticks out like a sore thumb now as you fight through corridor after featureless corridor in some levels. It's a good thing the combat is generally still a lot of fun, otherwise those levels would get real boring, real fast. The game's more natural exterior areas are still striking, though, and it's a great trip down memory lane to storm the beach in The Silent Cartographer again, especially with the game's slick graphical refresh.</p><p style=\"\">That overhaul brings CE's visuals more or less up to par with the other 360 Halo games, and it actually expands the color palette of a lot of those less interesting corridor sequences. In the original game, every interior had the same cold, blue-grey thing going on, but Anniversary paints different levels with different sets of colored lights and other glowing doohickeys to at least make them distinctive from one another. The Library alone uses reds and oranges on one floor, then blues and greens on another, which makes things a little more interesting visually even while you're mowing down the thousandth Flood infection critter in a row. It's also a nice touch that you can switch between new and old graphics with only a couple of seconds of downtime in between. It's a little odd that there are a few cases where the game is easier with the old style--the stealth-camo <a data-ref-id=\"3015-470\" href=\"/elites/3015-470/\" slug=\"elites\">elites</a> stand out better that way, and there's less foliage to obscure your zoomed shots in many outdoor spots--but otherwise, it's great to be able to compare the new graphics to the way Halo used to look, just to see how far we've come in 10 years.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">As serviceable as the new graphics are, the game seems bound to the animation routines and pathfinding of the original game, so while the characters look better, they still move around kind of mechanically. Your AI comrades can also behave hilariously badly at times. I had an ally run up in front of me and throw a grenade directly into a wall, which bounced back and killed us both. Another time, five NPCs busied themselves by running around in circles and colliding with each other, shouting things like \"I'm going after them!\" from about 50 feet behind the front line while I took on like eight enemies by myself. It's been so long since I played Halo: CE in its original form that I honestly can't remember how much of this is just an echo of the way the game used to be, but whether these issues are new or old, they aren't much fun.</p><p style=\"\">Rather than recreate everything about the original Halo's fondly remembered multiplayer, 343 has simply opted to offer a six-classic-map add-on (plus one new <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5869\" href=\"/firefight/3015-5869/\" slug=\"firefight\">Firefight</a> map, complete with AI buddies) for <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26786\" href=\"/halo-reach/3030-26786/\" slug=\"halo-reach\">Halo: Reach</a>. That means you're actually firing up Reach when you launch \"multiplayer\" from Anniversary's menu, so you're playing with the Reach matchmaking, the Reach physics, and the Reach weapons and abilities when you go online. At least there's a classic playlist that removes new-school player abilities and such for a more \"pure\" Halo multiplayer experience, but you still aren't going to get the exact same pistol in here, and it's a little jarring to play a bunch of the campaign and multiplayer side by side since the movement feels quite different between the two. On the upside, the new maps integrate really well with the Reach online infrastructure, and given that I haven't fired up Reach since it was new, it was heartwarming to see my custom <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13970\" href=\"/spartan-312/3005-13970/\" slug=\"spartan-312\">Noble 6</a> pop right back up.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2061199-halo_env_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2061199\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4608\" style=\"width: 4608px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2061199-halo_env_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2061199\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2061199-halo_env_01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2061199-halo_env_01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>This is a nice way to preserve Halo: CE for posterity in HD.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Naturally, your interest in this stuff largely hinges on how much you still enjoy the way Reach plays online. While it would have been nice to see everything about the original Halo: CE multiplayer recreated here, that kind of complete overhaul is probably beyond the scope of this package, which already feels like a sensible value at its $40 price point. The classic Anniversary maps will also be on sale on Xbox Live for Reach owners, and Anniversary itself includes a voucher for those maps in case you just want to store them on your hard drive and keep your Reach disc in the drive--giving you access to every bit of Reach multiplayer content yet released, assuming you own the other map packs--after you've finished the CE campaign. It's a reasonably elegant way to handle the split between the two games.</p><p style=\"\">Halo finds itself in the middle of a brief transitional period at the moment, between Bungie letting go of its sacred property and 343 kicking off its own stewardship of the franchise. It was probably a coincidence that the first game's tenth birthday fell right smack in between those two events, but regardless, Anniversary is a nicely executed, nostalgic way to keep Master Chief active in the public consciousness on an off year.</p>", "deck": "It's easy enough to look past the original Halo's more dated qualities given Anniversary's tasteful visual refresh and a combat formula that's still plenty exciting.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-450/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35534/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/halo-combat-evolved-anniversary/3030-35534/", "id": 35534, "name": "Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-11-17 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-111627/", "id": 111627, "name": "Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wwe-12-review/1900-451/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" slug=\"thq\">THQ</a> has reached a crossroads with its premiere pro-wrestling franchise.

Finally, wrestling games were going to cease to suck.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137457/1989800-profile_screenshot__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1989800\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55575539568345\" data-width=\"556\" style=\"width: 556px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137457/1989800-profile_screenshot__1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1989800\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137457/1989800-profile_screenshot__1_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>In WWE '12, THQ finally has produced something positive in its moribund simulation wrestling franchise.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Now that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35483\" href=\"/wwe-12/3030-35483/\" slug=\"wwe-12\">WWE '12</a> is in the wild, I can report that much of what THQ proclaimed is at least half true. Where previous sequels have smacked of non-effort, WWE '12 does feel like an earnest re-envisioning of what simulation wrestling games have been for years. The new engine paces matches better than anything we've played in years, and now all those insane accouterments <a data-ref-id=\"3010-16\" href=\"/yukes-co-ltd/3010-16/\" slug=\"yukes-co-ltd\">Yuke's</a> has been building up around that old, rickety game engine are actually <i>fun</i> to play. To be fair, in no way is WWE '12 a slam dunk--that new game engine offers up nearly as many quirks as it does improvements--but as a meaningful step forward for this franchise, it signals something that wrestling fans have mostly been without for the better part of the last several years: hope.</p><p style=\"\">First and foremost, it's the gameplay that sells WWE '12. It's difficult to describe exactly what's changed without delving into obnoxious minutae that's meaningless to all but the most insane of fans, but most of the core changes are lumped in with what THQ refers to as \"Predator technology.\" This tech represents a fairly significant overhauling of the series' animation mechanics, allowing for more freedom and opportunity for reversals and counter attacks. Whereas every move was more or less a canned animation before, each major move now has multiple spots where a player can reverse it. Let's say you're about to deliver a huge superplex from the top rope to an opposing player. That player can reverse the lockup in the corner, the moment after being placed on the top turnbuckle, or the moment where your wrestler stands up on the ropes to deliver the move. Perhaps in an effort to counterbalance the sheer volume of counters now at a player's disposal, the timing window for reversals has also been shortened, meaning you have to be exceedingly quick on the draw in order to reverse a move.</p><p style=\"\">It's a tricky balance, but it works more often than it doesn't. If nothing else, it actually adds an interesting pace and momentum shift to how matches tend to play out. I'm not sure if it's directly related to the Predator tech, or more ancillary changes elsewhere, but WWE '12 simply has the best match \"feel\" of any sim wrestling game in ages. Matches move with the kind of momentum swings absolutely vital to real (well, \"real,\" anyway) live wrestling. Especially noteworthy is the change to signatures and finishers. When you've built up enough momentum for a signature, all you have to do is press the Y or triangle button while standing in the proper position to deliver the move, and it's on. Once you hit the move, you immediately move to being able to deliver a finisher. In a neat little twist, certain taunts actually will set opponents up for those finishers too. If you're playing as, say, Steve Austin, and you're ready to hit a Stunner, he'll do his taunt where he flails his arms, demanding his victim stand back up, while the opponent does precisely that, groggy all the way.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's a play to the pageantry and theatrics of wrestling that has scarcely existed in these kinds of games that simultaneously doesn't sacrifice the competitive nature of the games themselves. You're still fighting to win, but the way the matches move and feel are more directly analogous to what's you see on TV. Now, it's not exactly perfect yet. Physics are still wonky in a number of spots, especially when it comes to weapon attacks and outside the ring antics, presumably because Yuke's still hasn't quite figured out how to naturally use the Havok physics engine. Also, the momentum-based grappling system installed in previous sequels still isn't particularly great. It's too hard to naturally do the moves you want to do (outside of finishers and signatures) since so many of the best grapple moves can't be done unless your opponent is stumbling around in front of you. Lastly, the total lack of HUD in this year's game is a nice presentational touch, but from a gameplay perspective, it's a bit troublesome, especially when you're trying to figure out if you're anywhere near finishing an opponent. You'll see your opponents start to grab parts of their body as they get worn down, but that signature/finisher icon that signals your near-victory tends to just pop up out of nowhere.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137457/1897165-kidd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1897165\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55575539568345\" data-width=\"556\" style=\"width: 556px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137457/1897165-kidd.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1897165\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137457/1897165-kidd.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The new Predator tech has its quirks, but by and large, it improves the flow of matches.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">On the subject of presentation, this is one area where WWE '12 hasn't really made any huge strides forward. In some ways, the game does look a little sharper than the last few SmackDown! sequels, but mostly that's in tangential elements, like arena visuals and pyrotechnics. The wrestler models haven't vastly improved, meaning we're still looking at the same weird faces and crummy hair that we've been enduring for ages. Animations also seem to be in a weird spot these days. Roughly half the moves look genuinely great, whereas the other half look stiff, lifeless, and even a bit floaty. It's especially noticeable with strikes, though many of the older, more base-level grapple moves also have this clunky look to them that invokes the old <a data-ref-id=\"3010-88\" href=\"/acclaim-entertainment-inc/3010-88/\" slug=\"acclaim-entertainment-inc\">Acclaim</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3045-43\" href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" slug=\"nintendo-64\">N64</a> wrestlers of yore.</p><p style=\"\">And then there's the commentary... Look, I think we're well beyond expecting miracles on this front. It's been such a noose around this series' neck for so long that anything even vaguely resembling an improvement might seem like a gift from the heavens. And lo and behold, there is a modicum of improvement here. Mostly, it's that <a data-ref-id=\"3040-99997\" href=\"/michael-cole/3040-99997/\" slug=\"michael-cole\">Michael Cole</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-59816\" href=\"/jerry-lawler/3040-59816/\" slug=\"jerry-lawler\">Jerry Lawler</a> appear to have mostly recorded new lines of dialogue, much of which actually talks about the wrestlers featured in the game. They're still stiff, unfunny, and periodically delve into bizarre, utilitarian territory with comments on wrestlers focusing on specific parts of the body, such as, \"Man, I don't know if he meant to focus on the head there, but he's delivering a lot of punishment!\" or some such. And yet, hearing these two work this year didn't make me want to reach into my ear canal and punch through my own ear drums. That cannot be considered anything but positive progress.</p><p style=\"\">Perhaps because of all the effort Yuke's sank into this Predator tech, most of the surrounding modes haven't changed much at all this year. The one to see the most alteration is the Road to Wrestlemania single-player mode. Whereas in the past, you would choose from one of several storylines and play through them at your leisure, this year's mode features one long, continuous story that features three distinct story threads. The first revolves around <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16291\" href=\"/sheamus/3005-16291/\" slug=\"sheamus\">Sheamus</a> and his quest for domination, whereas the next involves <a data-ref-id=\"3005-469\" href=\"/triple-h/3005-469/\" slug=\"triple-h\">Triple H</a> and his return to the ring. Finally, there's a rookie storyline involving a created character. It's perhaps a smarter move to craft one, singular, coherent storyline for this mode, but the big problem with this method of execution is that if you don't care about Sheamus or Triple H, you're still stuck playing as them for long stretches of time. The writing in this mode isn't strong enough to transcend what ever likes or dislikes you might have for these characters--in fact, it's pretty bad.</p><p style=\"\">Then again, these modes have always featured stories that felt like cast-off storylines from TV that the bookers had the good sense to cancel. This year is simply no different. What is different is how those story beats actually play out. In previous years, you were pretty much just winning every match, even though that's not really how wrestling works. Here, you're tasked with specific objectives in each match, which range from simply beating specific opponents, to wearing down opponents.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70803/1973387-lolol.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1973387\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56189047261815\" data-width=\"1333\" style=\"width: 1333px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70803/1973387-lolol.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1973387\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70803/1973387-lolol.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70803/1973387-lolol.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wrestler models haven't seen any drastic improvements this year.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">OK, so that's not really much of an objective range, but what is different is what happens once you meet these objectives. Once you do, a big button icon appears over the head of the opposing wrestler. Hitting that button engages a cutscene that shows your wrestler getting interfered with, you interfering with someone else, or whatever the hell happens in wrestling these days. Essentially, the designers have taken control of the story's primary events out of the player's hands. While I'm a big fan of trying to throw more of TV wrestling's tropes into the experience of the video games, completely removing control from the player is not an ideal way of handling this. There has to be a happy medium somewhere, where players can still participate in all the screw jobs and double-reverse screw jobs so vital to wrestling's chemistry without resorting to joyless cutscenes.</p><p style=\"\">Maybe they'll figure out that happy medium next year, but at the very least, if you find yourself dissatisfied with the Road to Wrestlemania, you can always take the battle online, or engage in any number of the myriad create modes contained within the game. None of these options have really changed much since last year; there is a new create-an-arena mode, which is pretty cool if you have it in your head that you want to build an old school WCW Thunder or TNA arena (just don't worry about WCW Monday Nitro, as that's already an unlockable). Wrestlers, storylines, entrances, moves, finishers, arenas, and whatever else--short of a create-a-title mode, or a create-an-announcer mode (please!), pretty much everything you could possibly want is there, and the ability to download and upload creations online is still awesome. I've already acquired completely acceptable versions of AJ Styles, Goldberg, and Rob Van Dam within a day of the game's release, and the classic ECW arena that's already up is superb. Now if someone could just make me a 100% accurate version of Glacier, Mortis, and Wrath, my life will be complete.</p><p style=\"\">Online competition does still have its hiccups, especially in the Royal Rumble mode. I ran into a lot of weird connection hang-ups and disconnects, possibly because the servers are still sputtering under the weight of sudden traffic. The matches I did get into, however, largely lacked lag of any kind, so if you get a good match-up, you'll be fine.</p><p style=\"\">One place you probably don't want to be spending your time is the WWE Universe mode. This debuted last year as a sort of alternative to the fully-scripted stories of the Road to Wrestlemania. Here, you can play through dynamically generated show schedules on any TV show or PPV, playing as any wrestlers you feel like. You can set up interference in matches, toy with match rules, and basically book as you please, but because the actual story bits are largely randomly generated, actually pulling a coherent story or rivalry out of this mode borders on impossible. It's not that it isn't fun to play around with these matches, but the whole interface and set-up is so unwieldy and complicated that at a point, it's barely worth fussing with because you'll never get the completely desired result.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137457/1881842-rock.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1881842\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55575539568345\" data-width=\"556\" style=\"width: 556px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137457/1881842-rock.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1881842\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137457/1881842-rock.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137457/1881842-rock.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>One gets the impression that most of the best classic wrestlers will appearing as DLC exclusively.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">And that's the one key thing that WWE '12 still has yet to overcome. Namely, its general unwieldiness as a game that a mass audience can play. Much as EA's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\" slug=\"madden-nfl\">Madden</a> franchise has struggled to maintain accessibility while still catering to the hardcore fanbase, THQ and Yuke's haven't quite found the ideal formula for making a wrestling game that anyone can enjoy. In a weird way, it's WWE '12's bad luck that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31641\" href=\"/wwe-all-stars/3030-31641/\" slug=\"wwe-all-stars\">WWE All-Stars</a> also happened to come out this year. Not that the two games are any more directly comparable than Madden and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-477\" href=\"/nfl-blitz/3025-477/\" slug=\"nfl-blitz\">NFL Blitz</a>, but All-Stars' stripped-down, fast-paced mentality felt like a breath of fresh air, especially compared with SmackDown! vs. RAW 2011's decrepit, shambolic gameplay. WWE '12 certainly pushes THQ's simulation wrestling business in a far more positive direction, but this game still has yet to find completely solid footing while balancing the needs of the existing fanbase alongside the needs of the fans who either have never tried one of these games, or simply have left long ago.</p><p style=\"\">Still, this is the first year where I feel like I can actually recommend a WWE game in earnest. Granted, it's a caveat-laden recommendation, but a recommendation nonetheless. Considering how long it's been since one of these games actually felt playable, let alone enjoyably so, it's almost worth putting up with the various peculiarities and more antiquated elements just so you can actually have fun <i>wrestling</i> again. WWE '12 is arguably more a signal of better things to come than a great game in its own right, but hey, at least it's something, right?</p>", "deck": "Though it's miles from perfect, WWE '12 represents the biggest step forward THQ's wrestling franchise has made in years.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-451/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35483/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wwe-12/3030-35483/", "id": 35483, "name": "WWE '12"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-11-23 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-111334/", "id": 111334, "name": "WWE '12"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mario-kart-7-review/1900-452/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/107492/1970861-8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1970861\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/107492/1970861-8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1970861\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/107492/1970861-8.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mario! In a go-kart!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I\u2019m a pretty staunch subscriber to the Unified Mario Kart Alpha Theory. For the non-scholars out there, this theory dictates that, within a certain margin of error, a person\u2019s first <a data-ref-id=\"3025-507\" href=\"/mario-kart/3025-507/\" slug=\"mario-kart\">Mario Kart</a> game will always be their favorite, and any subsequent Mario Kart experiences are spent trying to recapture that initial, and fairly specific, buzz of camaraderie, trash-talk, and impossible, shamelessly computer-assisted comebacks. It\u2019s a theory that, due to constant and intensive iteration, actually applies quite effortlessly to a lot of games.</p><p style=\"\">But Mario Kart serves as such a sterling example of this \u201cfirst bite\u201d phenomenon because we\u2019re now all the way up to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31747\" href=\"/mario-kart-7/3030-31747/\" slug=\"mario-kart-7\">Mario Kart 7</a>--though this is the first in the series to explicitly rub the number of times we\u2019ve fallen for the exact same trick in our collective faces--and Mario Kart expectations are intensely, almost dogmatically codified, and have been for years. In a way, it makes the already subjective process of writing a game review that much more nebulous. What is one even reviewing, exactly? The variations from one Mario Kart to the next can be extremely subtle, and whether a specific modulation is good or bad rests almost entirely in the hindsight of the player. That there has never been more than one Mario Kart on any given Nintendo platform further complicates things, and comparisons to other racing games--hell, other <a data-ref-id=\"3015-336\" href=\"/kart-racer/3015-336/\" slug=\"kart-racer\">kart racing</a> games, not that there have been any of particular merit in quite some time--are a moot point entirely.</p><p style=\"\">As someone who, in the face of the above-mentioned theory, doesn\u2019t <i>really</i> have a favorite Mario Kart game, what can I tell you about Mario Kart 7 for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-117\" href=\"/nintendo-3ds/3045-117/\" slug=\"nintendo-3ds\">3DS</a>? Well, it\u2019s about as good as it is familiar. Yes, it introduces brief aerial and underwater sequences to break things up, further kart customization, additional power-ups, and as many brand-new courses as courses it recycles from Mario Karts of yore. Even if it\u2019s all incredibly safe stuff, which it most definitely is, these modifications and additions seem good, or at least, do not contribute negatively to the previously established Mario Kart formula. To put it another way, if you like red sparks and hate blue shells, Mario Kart 7 is probably for you. To put it a third way, if this is your first Mario Kart, it seems like a pretty good one to kick things off with.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/1987707-027.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1987707\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27545/1987707-027.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1987707\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27545/1987707-027.png\"></a><figcaption>First-person mode is a short-lived novelty.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The fundamental action of hop-drifting around corners, trying to capitalize on boost pads and risky shortcuts, and deciding on the perfect moment to deploy your power-up remain the still-beating heart of Mario Kart. Of course, you\u2019ll regularly have strong performances up-ended, and weak performances propped up, by the game\u2019s unapologetically weighted power-up system, but if you didn\u2019t, that wouldn\u2019t really be Mario Kart, right?</p><p style=\"\">You can run single races on one of the game\u2019s 32 tracks, or compete in four-track grand prix cups. There are battle modes alongside the pure race events, but the open arena, proto-car-combat model feels more and more vestigial with each iteration. The single-player experience feels as anemic as always, with no structure beyond those grand prix cups, and no motivation beyond the promise of unlockable drivers and kart parts to keep playing. Online play seems snappy, even with a full load of eight players, though again, similar to the single-player experience, if the person you\u2019re racing isn\u2019t in the same room, online victories feel hollow, and there\u2019s no one to punch when you lose at the last possible second.

Eight players, each with their own copy of the game, would be ideal. Single-cart download support--which limits who and what you race, but not which tracks you can race on--seems generous, though load times are pronounced. It\u2019s still quite fun with less than eight, but let me be clear that I cannot in good conscience recommend this game if you don\u2019t have anyone to play with locally.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121333/1807349-25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807349\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"400\" style=\"width: 400px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/121333/1807349-25.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807349\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/121333/1807349-25.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/121333/1807349-25.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The new tracks are pretty consistently terrific.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As is <i>de rigueur</i> for Mario Kart, 7 incorporates some of its platform\u2019s native trickery in some conspicuous manner. Now you can opt to play Mario Kart by \u201cturning\u201d your 3DS as though it were a steering wheel, which is precisely as awful as it sounds. Worse, actually, because moving the 3DS around all but cancels out the game\u2019s stereoscopic 3D effects, which I found more transfixing than I have in most 3DS games I\u2019ve played. It\u2019s the only 3DS game where, over time, I\u2019ve found myself turning the 3D slider up, rather than the other way around.</p><p style=\"\">Regardless of your appreciation for 3D effects, this is a crisp, colorful game, and maybe it\u2019s just a matter of scale, but it might just be the best-looking Mario Kart yet. The track designs are impressive as well, and their scale, thematic ingenuity, use of 3D space, and smart but measured incorporation of underwater and aerial segments seem that much more impressive when compared directly to the classic tracks included.</p><p style=\"\">Despite the game's slavish adherence to the Mario Kart formula, Mario Kart 7 has moments where it shines simply by executing that formula really well. Still, other than your personal history with Mario Kart, your enjoyment of Mario Kart 7 will likely hinge on your continued appreciation of that formula, and friends to enjoy it with, more than anything else.</p>", "deck": "Confident execution of a familiar formula makes for a fun multiplayer experience, when the circumstances are right.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-452/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31747/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mario-kart-7/3030-31747/", "id": 31747, "name": "Mario Kart 7"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2011-11-29 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101623/", "id": 101623, "name": "Mario Kart 7"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/to-the-moon-review/1900-453/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-36242\" href=\"/to-the-moon/3030-36242/\" slug=\"to-the-moon\">To the Moon</a> writer/director/designer/composer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-101140\" href=\"/kan-gao/3040-101140/\" slug=\"kan-gao\">Kan Gao</a> is someone whose talents appear poised to shine in the game industry for a very long time. He is someone who clearly understands what it means to make a video game's story count for something, and he is unafraid to center those stories around challenging subjects that most other game designers assiduously avoid in favor of rote entertainment. The truth is, themes like death, loss, tragedy, and emotional connection can be entertaining--just not in the narrowly uproarious way most game designers tend to focus on. To the Moon is about all of these things, and quite a bit more. It's equally silly and serious, a frivolous adventure that becomes infinitely more meaningful as you trek deeper and deeper into it. And yet, I can't quite call To the Moon a great \"game,\" exactly, because for as much as To the Moon is something you play, its attempts at interactivity are often relegated to the sidelines in favor of pure narrative.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130765/1870194-ttm6..png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870194\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.81914893617021\" data-width=\"376\" style=\"width: 376px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:81.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/130765/1870194-ttm6..png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870194\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/130765/1870194-ttm6..png\"></a><figcaption>People who look to video games as a storytelling medium will find lots to like about To the Moon.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In a sense, it's the opposite of the problem we critics grouse about so often about video games. Gao's talent as a writer and storyteller becomes apparent early on, and his sense of direction is clear and pointed. Even his musical work (at least a portion of which was co-written with veteran composer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-97575\" href=\"/laura-shigihara/3040-97575/\" slug=\"laura-shigihara\">Laura Shigihara</a>) is strong throughout. But as with all jack-of-all-trades developers, Gao is clearly better at some things than others. His concept for a game design is to borrow liberally from the top-down, 16-bit era RPGs of the early '90s, then remove nearly all the mechanics inherent to that genre in favor of a design that's closer to a classic PC adventure game. You spend a great deal of time pixel hunting through a highly pixelated world, searching for clues that will simply take you to the next story bit. The best thing you can say about it is that it's largely unobtrusive, allowing you to connect with Gao's writing free of frustration.</p><p style=\"\">And that's good, because the writing is superb. In To the Moon, Gao has crafted a sci-fi story as touching and heartbreaking as some of the best films in the genre. But before it becomes that way, it starts out a little goofy, with the introduction of Doctors Eva Rosaline and Neil Watts as they crash their car while trying to avoid a squirrel in the road. These two have been sent to the rural, barely-accessible home of an elderly man known only as Johnny. Their task? To give him the memories he's always wanted. Their job is sort of a reverse take on <i>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind</i>--where that film's central technology focused on the erasing of memories, To the Moon focuses on the wholesale creation of them. In this case, Johnny's lifelong dream was to go to the moon.</p><p style=\"\">In order to create this new set of idyllic memories, the pair hook themselves up to Johnny's mind and begin traversing backward through Johnny's life, hopping and skipping from memory to memory using connecting objects scattered throughout each memory. Much as Christopher Nolan crafted the mystery of <i>Memento</i> by placing his clues at the chronological end of the story, Gao sets his tale up with numerous peculiar threads dangling enticingly in front of the player. What was the nature of Johnny's relationship with his wife, River, a reclusive and emotionally detached woman with obsessive tendencies? Why does Johnny seem so utterly puzzled when asked about the origins of his desire to visit the moon? Why are there origami rabbits <i>everywhere</i>?</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/59500/2020997-ttm1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2020997\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.71467391304348\" data-width=\"368\" style=\"width: 368px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/59500/2020997-ttm1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2020997\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/59500/2020997-ttm1.png\"></a><figcaption>Those who prefer their video games with a bit more \"video game\" in them, however, might have a few issues.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In less capable hands, it would be easy to envision this story spiraling out into some kind of bizarre, mystical nonsense for the sake of ratcheting up the tension in typical video game fashion. By and large, Gao and his crew of collaborators at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7791\" href=\"/freebird-games/3010-7791/\" slug=\"freebird-games\">Freebird Games</a> manage to avoid this. Yes, this is sci-fi, set in the not-too-distant future, thus presenting a wide variety of possible fantastical outcomes that could easily explain everything that's happening away. Instead, Gao trusts his characters to carry this thing through, keeping the focus on Johnny and his memories, while dealing out vital pieces of information that keep this story grounded in a sense of reality, no matter how futuristic it might be.</p><p style=\"\">That trust results in a tale filled with characters you legitimately grow to care about. Maybe that sounds odd when you're describing 16-bit looking sprites that largely emote through wide-eyed, startled jumps and periodic shakes of the head, but Gao imbues them with enough humanity to keep you glued to the screen through the whole four hours of To the Moon.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">I can already sense the grumbling on the other side of the screen from potential players displeased with that relatively brisk length, but before you get too grouchy about it, a bit of perspective. To the Moon is a $12 game (one currently only available from Freebird Games' website, but will purportedly be on Steam in the near future), and save for a few awkward moments here and there--most egregiously, a late-game shooter sequence that controls about as well as the hunting simulation in the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17852\" href=\"/the-oregon-trail/3030-17852/\" slug=\"the-oregon-trail\">Oregon Trail</a>--the game hardly wastes a second of that play time. Each moment feels vital to the pacing of the player's discovery, even though you aren't necessarily doing a whole lot to make those discoveries. Again, this game is essentially a pixel hunt, tasking you with clicking around environments to get through dialogue bits and to recognize items you can use to progress to the next stage. There are a few puzzles here and there, but they're rarely challenging and become more than a bit repetitive as the game goes along--thankfully, they disappear before the game's final third.</p><p style=\"\">If there is any issue to be taken with To the Moon outside of gameplay, it's that it periodically has issues finding its tone. As emotionally wrenching as the game can be, Gao counterbalances that dire seriousness with quite a bit of humor, most of which comes from the two doctors constantly butting heads with each other. Their dynamic is very anime, with the headstrong-yet-eternally-curious woman constantly wagging her finger at her lazy manchild of a cohort, and at times, it wears thin. It's especially true when Gao overindulges in memetic Internet humor. Most of those gags are fine, but it pops up a little too often, and sometimes in situations where it's more distracting than it is humorous.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2076748-2076747-to_the_moon_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2076748\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75436793422405\" data-width=\"973\" style=\"width: 973px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2076748-2076747-to_the_moon_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2076748\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2076748-2076747-to_the_moon_3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2076748-2076747-to_the_moon_3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Why yes, that IS an Animorphs reference!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Still, these are the kinds of indiscretions you can forgive in the greater context of an experience as wonderful as To the Moon. This is a game that well represents the enormous potential of a writer/designer on the cusp of delivering something pretty fantastic to our chosen medium. That said potential is not fully realized here is perhaps due to the fact that Freebird Games is, by and large, Gao's baby. The actual number of people credited on this game consists far more of contract content providers than it does actual employees, meaning very few people dedicated themselves wholly to the completion of this project, with Gao chief among them.</p><p style=\"\">As a result, one can easily see why Gao would be so willing to wrap his story in such an age-old style of gaming, given the relatively few restraints it puts on the player. I don't believe that To the Moon's approach of excising gameplay in favor of visual novel-style storytelling is necessarily the answer to the \"interactivity vs. narrative\" argument developers have struggled with lo these many years, but there are enough flashes of brilliance inside To the Moon's shell to give one the impression that such a breakthrough might be on the horizon. Given more resources, more collaborative experience, and a few more finely crafted tales like To the Moon under his belt, it feels wholly possible that Kan Gao could help bring that breakthrough about someday, perhaps in the not-too-distant future.</p>", "deck": "The interactive elements of To the Moon exist solely in service of pushing you through its story, but it's a story very much worth pushing through.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-453/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36242/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/to-the-moon/3030-36242/", "id": 36242, "name": "To the Moon"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-12-06 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114377/", "id": 114377, "name": "To the Moon"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/skylanders-spyros-adventure-review/1900-454/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129927/1996112-skylanders___prism_break.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1996112\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:100.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/129927/1996112-skylanders___prism_break.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1996112\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/12/129927/1996112-skylanders___prism_break.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Though you can get by with just the three starter Skylanders included with the game, you'll have to make additional purchases if you want to see everything.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As a parent of zero, I try to stay out of the whole \"is this game good for kids?\" discussion... because I have no idea. I can sit here and theorize and posit, but beyond thinking that kids are constantly getting sold short by parents who think their children aren't with it enough to handle \"real\" games and marketers who often try to push some sort of half-assed \"edutainment\" agenda when promoting youth-oriented games, I don't really have a dog in this hunt. But I will say I wasn't really expecting much from the game part of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34129\" href=\"/skylanders-spyros-adventure/3030-34129/\" slug=\"skylanders-spyros-adventure\">Skylanders: Spyro's Adventure</a>. Actually, the part where Skylanders is a game is sort of the least interesting thing about it, even though it's more than competent, especially when taken against the somewhat low standards we usually see in the \"for kids\" area. The cool part is the tech side of Skylanders, which merges its <a data-ref-id=\"3025-230\" href=\"/gauntlet/3025-230/\" slug=\"gauntlet\">Gauntlet</a>-like gameplay with physical objects that unlock new characters, levels, and bonus items. It all comes together to form a sort-of-insidious-but-surprisingly-fun mesh of collectible and video game.</p><p style=\"\">OK, let's break down the tech side of Skylanders. With the game you get a \"magic\" Portal of Power, which connects to your game-playing machine via USB. It's full of lights that can make it glow and pulsate with a lot of different colors. It also has a sensor in it that reads some sort of RFID-like datastore that lives in each one of the figurines. The idea is simple: you take a character, drop it on the portal, and bang, that character appears in your game. Take the figurine off and the action stops, letting you switch out to new characters on-the-fly or, if you like, jump a second player in or out at any time. As you play the game, you'll earn experience points, find hats, and accrue currency on a per-character basis. That information, along with the upgrades you choose to buy for your character with said currency, are stored in the figurines themselves. This then allows you to treat each one as a little save game storage device and also allows you to move your Skylanders from one game to another--in case you're heading over to a friend's house to skyland it up or something--while maintaining the progress you've made. You can also use those same figurines in the 3DS version of the game, which is a completely different beast, or, if you want to connect your portal to a PC or Mac, you can take your figures into an online collection of occasionally crummy Flash minigames and online chat. The portability of the Skylanders toy line and the way they all work with any and all of the Skylanders video games is pretty awesome. The portal itself rings up your characters extremely quickly, which is absolutely key to making it feel... well... magical.</p><p style=\"\">With the starter kit you'll get three Skylanders characters of different types, giving you some decent coverage to get going with. The game itself doesn't directly trade off of the elemental abilities in a \"water beats fire\" sort of way, though. Instead, the game sort of arbitrarily assigns bonuses to specific types of characters in different areas. It'll also lock you out of certain areas unless you're using a character of the appropriate type. So if you encounter a gate that can only be opened by an Undead-type Skylander, you're going to need to yank your fire guy off of the portal and replace him with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-20833\" href=\"/ghost-roaster/3005-20833/\" slug=\"ghost-roaster\">Ghost Roaster</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-20827\" href=\"/chop-chop/3005-20827/\" slug=\"chop-chop\">Chop Chop</a> or something if you want to get into that area. With one Skylander of each type, you'll be able to see just about everything there is to see in Skylanders, but if you aren't into the whole \"buying a bunch of toys\" thing, you can still finish the game and see the vast majority of the content with the starter pack alone. But then... if you aren't into the whole \"buying a bunch of toys\" thing, Skylanders might not be for you at all. If you start going deep down the Skylanders hole, just know that you can easily spend <i>hundreds</i> of dollars collecting the 32 core characters (more if you want the variants!) multiple level add-ons, and bonus items. And some of the characters haven't even hit stores yet. It's not a great deal, when you start to break it down, but the figurines look pretty nice and translate well into in-game characters, with a lot of good variety that makes most characters feel pretty different from each other.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1706172-skylanders_spyros_adventure_announced_by_activision____first_screenshots_showing_off_our_favorite_purple_dragon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1706172\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1706172-skylanders_spyros_adventure_announced_by_activision____first_screenshots_showing_off_our_favorite_purple_dragon.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1706172\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1099/1706172-skylanders_spyros_adventure_announced_by_activision____first_screenshots_showing_off_our_favorite_purple_dragon.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Though Spyro's name is on the box, Skylanders feels like an all-new thing, not another attempt to drag the dragon back into the spotlight.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">All of these characters are jammed into a story where the Skylanders must rebuild a mystical machine to save the world from an evil little goofball named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-20852\" href=\"/kaos/3005-20852/\" slug=\"kaos\">Kaos</a>. You're dropped into a hub world and run through a collection of top-down levels that have you bashing monsters and solving light puzzles. The elemental gates provide some optional areas, though some hidden objects don't require a separate purchase to access. Man, that sentence makes this whole thing sound kind of horrible, doesn't it? The bonus items are hats that enhance your stats, but none of them are especially crucial, and as you approach level 10--the cap--your Skylanders will be dominating the vast majority of the enemies you face.</p><p style=\"\">The characters, again, help make the combat interesting as they let you tailor the game to our own style. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-20822\" href=\"/gill-grunt/3005-20822/\" slug=\"gill-grunt\">Gill Grunt</a>, to name one of the Skylanders you'll get in the starter package, is projectile-based, with a speargun that fires slowly but does good damage and a water hose attack that hits at a steady rate. You'll need to upgrade your water tank if you want to fire that one forever, though. If you're interested in an up-close attack, characters like Chop Chop are more melee-focused. Armed with a sword and shield, Chop Chop has a basic multi-hit sword combo and his shield is one of the few abilities in the game that, you know, blocks damage. He's also a rad-looking skeletal warrior, which is pretty cool. Then there's <a data-ref-id=\"3005-20828\" href=\"/prism-break/3005-20828/\" slug=\"prism-break\">Prism Break</a>, who does a bit of both and offers some more complex upgrade options. Prism Break, by default, has a small area of effect attack that pushes nearby enemies back with a decent amount of damage and a laser beam that doesn't go too far or last very long. Through upgrades you can unlock the ability to drop crystals into the level that refract your laser attack, letting you cover more territory with your beams. Then you can buy an upgrade that turns defeated enemies into crystals, which lets you sort of fill the screen with hot laser death. Not every Skylander is terrific--<a data-ref-id=\"3005-20825\" href=\"/eruptor/3005-20825/\" slug=\"eruptor\">Eruptor</a> just seems kind of sluggish and ineffective, at least at lower levels--but there are so many out there that trying them out in different scenarios ends up being half the fun.

Seems pricey.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's not a difficult game, but there's more to Skylanders than you might think. Or, at least, you're probably not going to waltz through the entire game in a day, giving you plenty of time to sit and obsess over the Skylanders you don't currently own and which upgrade path you want to take when you level your next character up. Once you start to pick it all apart, it's easy to see its devious brilliance--it's essentially an example of \"on-disc DLC\" taken to horrifying extremes, except you need to go out and buy a physical thing to unlock that content in the game. Oh, and by the way, those physical things seem to be going in and out of stock at some retailers with the sort of alarming frequency that lets you know that it's probably going to do pretty well around Christmas time, which can add a horrifying new layer to all of this if you're, for example, desperately seeking <a data-ref-id=\"3005-20835\" href=\"/drobot/3005-20835/\" slug=\"drobot\">Drobot</a>. But when you put aside the crass consumerism that drives every decent children's toy/movie/cartoon/game brand, Skylanders managed to be just engaging enough to make all my ridiculous collector's tendencies pay off.</p><p style=\"\">The portal is fun to use, and exploring the powers and abilities of the different Skylanders is at least as engaging as the good variety of levels you'll see as you work your way through the adventure.

The company, which has made hundreds of millions of dollars in government contracts working for the US Army in Iraq, has changed its name not just once (to Xe Services) but twice (it's now known as Academi) in the last few years to try and counteract its own bad PR. Not that you can blame them. After years of accusations regarding illegal weapons trafficking, the alleged killings of civilians and subsequent cover-ups, and recruiting practices that saw them employing former members of Augusto Pinochet's death squads, you can hardly be surprised that they'd do just about anything they could to make the public forget about all of that.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1807464-highres_screenshot_00066.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807464\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1807464-highres_screenshot_00066.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807464\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/13692/1807464-highres_screenshot_00066.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Apparently \"beard technology\" is not something Zombie Studios has quite grasped yet.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Thus enters <a href=\"/blackwater/3030-35555/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-35555\">Blackwater</a>, a video game with a curiously outdated title and a message to the public that lets you know that, hey, these guys aren't so bad after all! When they aren't smuggling guns to the King of Jordan or getting sued by dozens of Iraqi families for \"random killings,\" they're helping out the U.N., rescuing formerly deposed peaceful leaders of fictional North African countries, taking down brutal military dictatorships, rescuing hostages and killing the same five recycled models of generic terrorists for about 90 minutes at a time.</p><p style=\"\">Blackwater feels, for all intents and purposes, like a public relations blast. It's less a video game than an attempt to try and sway the public opinion (at least insofar as the public opinion relates to gamers) back to their side, presenting them as a bunch of selfless, good-natured totally-not-mercenaries who save hostages and deliver food and totally don't kill civilians. How could they, when there are literally no civilians anywhere in this game? It's like they took a one way ticket straight to terrorist town.</p><p style=\"\">As a PR tool, Blackwater is rather vile, not to mention woefully ineffective. It stages life as a Blackwater contractor as something akin to being in the fucking A-Team, minus any of the dramatic flair or clever wit. All these chuckleheads do is crack the same jokes to each other--literally, it's the same jokes recycled dozens and dozens of times throughout the game--while periodically dropping an \"Oscar Mike\" or other piece of equally ubiquitous military terminology to let you know how legit these guys really are. The dialogue is so stiff and tone-deaf that it makes <a href=\"/dick-marcinko/3005-10492/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-10492\">Richard Marcinko</a> sound like Ernest Hemingway, and that's before it even gets around to actually making cracks about the company's own miserable reputation. Yes, that's right: this game actually makes fun of the fact that people think Blackwater is awful and made up of mercenary killers. There are no words...</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1807466-highres_screenshot_00077.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807466\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1807466-highres_screenshot_00077.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807466\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/13692/1807466-highres_screenshot_00077.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Do you like this enemy model?

This is an on-rails light gun game without the light gun. Light gun games are not \"real first-person shooters,\" at least as I understand the definition. They're target shoots where the targets shoot back. This game has more in common with <a href=\"/time-crisis/3030-15867/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-15867\">Time Crisis</a> or <a href=\"/hogans-alley/3030-6490/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-6490\">Hogan's Alley</a> than it does <a href=\"/modern-warfare/3025-1258/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-1258\">Modern Warfare</a> or <a href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" data-ref-id=\"3025-51\">Battlefield</a>, and it's not even as good as Hogan's Alley.</p><p style=\"\">For one thing, the aiming is terrible whether you're using Kinect or not. With Kinect, you're theoretically supposed to aim your hand like it's a gun, and effectively live out a way more boring version of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZcNXe20dXI\" rel=\"nofollow\">this</a>. Except that's really tiring after a while, and also patently unnecessary. You can just lift your hand up a bit so it recognizes that your arms are there, and then you're fine. It's like you're shooting bullets out of your palms, but whatever. The bigger issue is that the aiming reticle is jittery and also slow as hell. It takes seconds (as in plural) to move the reticle from one side of the screen to the other. It's even worse if you play with a controller, though maybe that should be of no surprise. No light gun game translates well to dual-analog sticks, but the fact that it still sucks with Kinect is pretty astounding.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That's the least of Blackwater's gameplay sins. More atrocious are the enemies and level designs, which dart violently between stump-stupid and frustratingly harrowing. Roughly half the enemies in the game will dart out from cover and then just kind of stand there while blurting out lines that sound about a step away from <i>South Park's</i> \"Durka Durka!\" terrorist dialogue. Forever. They will <i>never move</i>. Only after you shoot every other enemy on screen will they bother to shoot, but they still won't move. As for the ones who do demonstrate cognitive ability, they're still usually pretty easy to blow away, except for a random few who are such crack shots that they can basically pick you off entirely in three shots. This is where cover presumably comes into play, except that the cover mechanics are largely broken. If you're standing right next to a perfectly placed wall, then great, you can just hide behind it until your health regenerates. If you have to crouch, or bend in any sort of awkward way, most times the game has no idea what the hell you're trying to do, and just makes you stand there, soaking up bullets like they were glorious, life-giving sunlight.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1807458-highres_screenshot_00019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807458\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1807458-highres_screenshot_00019.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807458\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/13692/1807458-highres_screenshot_00019.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/ignore_jpg_scale_medium/1/13692/1807458-highres_screenshot_00019.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>If you buy Blackwater, the terrorists don't win. However, the next step below terrorists (mercenaries) do.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once you do die, you have to replay the entire level over again. <i>All of it</i>. Granted, most levels last between 5-7 minutes, but that's still a decent chunk of content you're going to be repeating again and again, until you either figure out which enemy is randomly really good at shooting you, or you quit in pure frustration. I'm not sure if it's an accidental bonus or something close to tragic, but ultimately you'll only be doing any of this for maybe 90 minutes total. The campaign is ludicrously short, which gives one the impression that this game may have been intended for arcades at one point in its development cycle. What to do when you finish that 90 minute campaign? You could replay the same godawful levels you just played for better scores, or you could try out the barely-stitched-on multiplayer component, though that would entail subjecting friends to this game's various unpleasantries. With friends like you, who needs private military contractors?</p><p style=\"\">All of this misery for $50 a pop. An hour and a half of busted-ass light gun shooting that barely masks the deplorable PR message underneath. In effect, buyers of Blackwater are paying for propaganda. They're handing over money to a shady group of alleged killers for the privilege of being told that these guys aren't shady or killers or anything to that effect. The only good news is that the message is altogether lost in a sea of half-baked gameplay, barely-functioning graphics, and horrible one-liners.

But then, Trine was already so good that it's hard to argue with more of the same great game, right?</p><p style=\"\">The side-scrolling puzzle mechanics in Trine 2 are taken directly from the original, meaning everything still hinges on the three-way split between the knight, wizard, and thief characters who are linked together by the mystical soul-binding artifact called the Trine. All three characters handle more or less the same as they did before, and you still have access to a talent tree that provides them pretty much the same abilities, with a few minor additions. The wizard <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10699\" href=\"/amadeus/3005-10699/\" slug=\"amadeus\">Amadeus</a> again acts as your physics tool, since you can use him to manipulate all sorts of objects in the environment, using the game's robust physics system, and also conjure boxes and planks out of thin air to help you climb about. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10701\" href=\"/zoya/3005-10701/\" slug=\"zoya\">Zoya</a>, the thief, handles ranged combat with her arrows and is the most nimble character with a grappling hook that gets her swinging from anything made of wood. And the trusty old knight <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10700\" href=\"/pontius/3005-10700/\" slug=\"pontius\">Pontius</a> is mostly here to do the heavy combat lifting with either his sword and shield or a heavier hammer that you can throw around with an optional upgrade.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2010213-trine22011oct004720p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2010213\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2010213-trine22011oct004720p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2010213\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2010213-trine22011oct004720p.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The occasional boss monster shows up to interrupt your platforming every now and again.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You're up against a race of burly, green-skinned <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1593\" href=\"/goblins/3015-1593/\" slug=\"goblins\">goblins</a> this time around, and though it's occasionally fun to employ that neat omnidirectional control over the knight's shield and the thief's arrows in a fight, it's often faster to just flail at nearby enemies as fast as you can with your sword, since you'll usually kill all of them before they kill you. The story is just barely more substantial here than in the first game, involving a long lost kingdom and a couple of magical princesses, and it mostly serves to propel you through the game's dozen fantastic chapters set in swamps, caves, and an ice fortress level that's probably one of the most visually stunning video game environments ever rendered.</p><p style=\"\">True, you've seen all these abilities--and the general gameplay model that results from switching between the three characters on the fly to use them smartly in concert--before. Where Trine 2 feels like it moves things forward significantly is in the design of the levels, and the new ways you can influence them. Fluid dynamics play a more central role in much of the puzzle design; there are quite a few instances where you need to direct the flow of water onto magical plants to make them grow to gigantic size, and you can get creative to accomplish that goal by balancing troughs to funnel the water, stacking several conjured planks together, or sometimes just standing underneath a waterfall and raising your shield at the right angle. There are a lot of nifty clockwork machines that you can use the wizard to manipulate, and there are simply more elements in the environment, like the gigantic, springy leaves that grow out of those giant plants that you can grab onto and move around to aid in your puzzle-solving. There's a lot of really satisfying stuff in here in that regard, in the ways you can get hands-on with the vast array of manipulable objects to creatively get past obstacles.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2010220-trine22011oct010720p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2010220\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2010220-trine22011oct010720p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2010220\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2010220-trine22011oct010720p.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2010220-trine22011oct010720p.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's a fantastic range of environments from one chapter to the next.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The first Trine offered only local cooperative play, and the sequel improves on this with online co-op that lets all three characters mix it up over the Internet. I played through both Trine games by myself and enjoyed them purely as puzzle-focused action games, but even if you do that too, it's worth going back and at least checking out a few levels with friends later on. It really becomes a different game when you get all three characters in there at once, and not just because that opens up some elaborate new ways you can work together. Griefing each other with your respective abilities can be at least as fun as playing the game the right way. The online co-op worked well for me in general; you can quick-match your way into a random open game, or you can browse a nice list of games showing what level and how many characters are in play. I matched into a couple of games where my character inexplicably refused to respond to the controls, but otherwise online play was functional and relatively lag-free. Offline co-op has a minor camera issue where some characters can disappear off the side of the screen occasionally, which gets awkward, but Frozenbyte has said a fix in the works.</p><p style=\"\">Co-op play is certainly well and good, but the deeper you get into the game, the more puzzles you encounter that seem like they were designed specifically with co-op in mind. The wizard can levitate objects while other characters stand on them, but not when he's standing on them himself, and for that reason alone, obstacles that are a 10-second cooperative trifle suddenly become maddening when you're the only one there to put all the pieces together. In other cases you need to do things like pull and hold a lever to keep a door open, and that requires you to move faster than the game otherwise makes you do when you're by yourself. Other times you'll find yourself awkwardly trying to climb up a rickety stack of conjured boxes to get somewhere that wouldn't be so hard to reach if you just had a little help. Nothing in the game is insurmountable in single-player, but it would've been nice if some of the solutions felt a little more elegant when you're playing alone.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">On top of the generally improved core gameplay, Trine 2 has some more nice options and refinements around the periphery. Naturally, you can revisit any chapter at will after you've finished the story, bringing in all of your unlocked abilities, and in addition to the ubiquitous experience orbs there are also collectible paintings and poems to find. There are no achievements pertaining to collectibles or level progress, though; the game admirably focuses all 12 of its achievements on unique challenges that push the game mechanics to the extreme, like surfing an air current on one of the wizard's planks for four seconds, or shooting three arrows into the air with the thief and catching them on the knight's shield. Say what you want about achievements in general, but this specific set of them is a great way to help you wring some unusual extra gameplay out of Trine 2. Probably the best new thing in the game is the \"unlimited\" mode that opens up after you finish the story, which lets you play a version of co-op where each player can use any character at any time, meaning you can have three wizards in there creating enough boxes to completely overrun the screen if you want. That gets as ludicrous as you expect it would.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38405/2061455-trine2_1_large1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2061455\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5624\" data-width=\"1250\" style=\"width: 1250px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/38405/2061455-trine2_1_large1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2061455\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38405/2061455-trine2_1_large1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/38405/2061455-trine2_1_large1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game looks so good it's almost painful.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You just can't talk about Trine 2 without mentioning how painfully gorgeous it is. Cue half a dozen superlatives talking about the lavish detail and eye-popping visual effects slathered all over every scene, but seriously, this has to be one of the best-looking games made to date. Just look at some videos of it to see why. The only thing you could say against the game's visual design is that it runs at 11 for the entire game; every single scene is so dense with small details and numerous glowing, over-saturated colored light sources that it would be nice to also see similar technology and artistic sensibilities applied in a more reserved fashion from time to time. Your eyeballs feel like they might get cavities. I'm heaping all this praise mainly on the PC version, which is easily capable of running at 60 frames per second at really high resolution; I played it on my TV at 1080p with a wireless controller, and it was glorious. The Xbox 360 version is much lower-resolution and runs at a frame rate that's steady but appeared to be barely at 30, or maybe a bit below. That candy-coated art style still shines through on the console, though, and if that's your only way to play Trine 2, you won't be disappointed. But play the PC version if you can.</p><p style=\"\">The best thing about Trine 2 is that even with its notable set of improvements, at $15 it's still a good bit cheaper than the first game was at release. With a lower price, must-see visuals, and unique platforming that works well by yourself and better with friends, Trine 2 makes for a nice little bite-size piece of entertainment during this otherwise slow holiday period.</p>", "deck": "Trine 2 might be one of the prettiest games ever made, and it makes some small but important additions to its predecessor's formula, too.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-456/", "platforms": "PC, Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31661/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/trine-2/3030-31661/", "id": 31661, "name": "Trine 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-12-24 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101739/", "id": 101739, "name": "Trine 2"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/all-zombies-must-die-review/1900-457/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2103534-pre_launch_22_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2103534\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56293979671618\" data-width=\"1279\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2103534-pre_launch_22_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2103534\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2103534-pre_launch_22_03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The crafting of bizarre weapons is handled well.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I used to think <a data-ref-id=\"3015-79\" href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" slug=\"zombie\">zombie</a>-shooting and RPG-style character progression were <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21534\" href=\"/dead-island/3030-21534/\" slug=\"dead-island\">all I needed</a> for a good time, but the top-down shooter <a data-ref-id=\"3030-36297\" href=\"/all-zombies-must-die/3030-36297/\" slug=\"all-zombies-must-die\">All Zombies Must Die</a> puts some strain on that notion. For a modestly priced downloadable game, it's got a surprisingly complex and well-designed framework for leveling up your abilities and creating better, sillier weapons for mowing down zombies en masse. But what initially seems like a winning formula is held back by combat that feels clunky at times, and a mission structure repetitive enough that you may not want to see it the whole way through.</p><p style=\"\">There's a lighthearted zombie-apocalypse storyline with some genuinely chuckle-worthy absurdist humor here and there, but in general the game leans a little too heavily on the idea that the four characters realize they're taking part in a video game. That makes a lot of the jokes feel a little too obvious. I can forgive some bland writing in favor of those old carrots-on-a-stick <a data-ref-id=\"3015-365\" href=\"/random-loot/3015-365/\" slug=\"random-loot\">loot</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-934\" href=\"/crafting/3015-934/\" slug=\"crafting\">crafting</a>, though, and All Zombies Must Die delivers on that front. You've got all the zombie-game standbys you could want with a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotgun</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-168\" href=\"/chainsaw/3055-168/\" slug=\"chainsaw\">chainsaw</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-413\" href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" slug=\"assault-rifle\">assault rifle</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1913\" href=\"/cricket-bat/3055-1913/\" slug=\"cricket-bat\">cricket bat</a>, among others, and you can craft better versions of those weapons to get modifiers like faster reloads, life steal, and a chance to set zombies on fire. However you feel about zombies at this point, it's hard to argue with the idea of a flaming chainsaw, right? You also level up your characters themselves, and you can dump skill points into attack, defense, health, and speed to make them play more like you want them to. The game's RPG underpinnings are put together well and make you want to keep going to improve your abilities, like a good RPG should.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2103524-pre_launch_16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2103524\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56293979671618\" data-width=\"1279\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2103524-pre_launch_16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2103524\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2103524-pre_launch_16.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Using your weird weapons can be fun, but the combat feels awkward a little too often.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But the feel of the combat is often too awkward to support all those options for customizing your play style. The weapons feel weak when you start out, forcing you to dump several rounds of ammo into even the basic fodder enemies. That goes from mildly annoying to downright frustrating when the game forces you to play as a weaker character for a particular mission and you get mobbed by a dozen zombies faster than you can fight them off. And while I really liked the way the upgrade system is implemented, no amount of mods to the other weapons could make me want to use anything but the chainsaw and shotgun. To be fair, if you're going to get two weapons right in your zombie game, it should be those two, but it's a shame the other weapons don't pack more punch.</p><p style=\"\">All Zombies Must Die has some neat ideas about how to handle the distribution of loot and crafting materials. There are a few spots where you just have to kill enemies blindly and hope for a random drop, but in most cases, you get specific items to drop by killing zombies in specific ways that the game is good about instructing you on. For instance, if you need firewood (used to craft flame-related weapons), you need to head to the town square and kill 30 zombies that are on fire. You need to actively set them on fire by leading them through flames in the environment or using other specific weapons, and that sort of active participation in fulfilling the quest objectives helps to keep things interesting.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's a good thing those unique challenges are there, because the deeper you get into the game, the more the missions start to run together, and eventually it feels like you're being made to run back and forth incessantly just to pad out the length of the game. One particularly irksome mission had me travel clear across most of the game world to a new area, only to be arbitrarily stopped at the gate and told I had to head all the way back to the place where I'd just picked up that mission in order to do something else first.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2103536-pre_launch_23_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2103536\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56293979671618\" data-width=\"1279\" style=\"width: 1279px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2103536-pre_launch_23_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2103536\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2103536-pre_launch_23_05.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2103536-pre_launch_23_05.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>We get it. You're in a video game and you know it.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game also has a habit of stopping you at the transition points between areas and giving you a quick challenge you have to complete before you can pass through. These generally only take a a minute or two and feel like they're adding some variety to your activities at first, but later on they get to be a drag when you just want to get where you're going without delay. (A single time I was given a challenge to pick up three gold coins with no hint as to what might make them more likely to drop, and proceeded to run around for 20 minutes before I even saw two of them appear. But that single instance seems so anomalous it may have actually been buggy in some way.)</p><p style=\"\">With four playable characters, All Zombies Must Die seems tailor-made for four-player co-op, and four people can in fact play at once...on a single console. Given that this is an involved, story-based experience with characters who persistently get better over time, and not a pick-up-and-play action game with no carryover between sessions, you're not likely to get four people to sit still in one place long enough to go all the way through it. Online multiplayer would have suited this type of game better, so it's a real shame it's not included.</p><p style=\"\">In the era of $15 downloadable games, maybe All Zombies Must Die is aware of its limitations since it's priced at a relatively modest $10. There's some great design in here and the game is genuinely entertaining in short bursts, but its weaker aspects add up over time to produce an experience that's less satisfying than its best ideas deserve.</p>", "deck": "Crafting irradiated shotguns to better dispatch the undead is a great idea, but clunky combat and a lack of mission variety keep this downloadable shooter from realizing its potential.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-457/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3), Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36297/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/all-zombies-must-die/3030-36297/", "id": 36297, "name": "All Zombies Must Die!"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-01-12 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114914/", "id": 114914, "name": "All Zombies Must Die!"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/saints-row-the-third-review/1900-458/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2102846-7020sr3_yarngasm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2102846\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2102846-7020sr3_yarngasm_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2102846\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2102846-7020sr3_yarngasm_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's something to be said for the idea of driving a rampaging ball of yarn, but it feels broken.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" slug=\"thq\">THQ</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1007\" href=\"/volition-incorporated/3010-1007/\" slug=\"volition-incorporated\">Volition</a> have released a few, mostly cosmetic additions to the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25725\" href=\"/saints-row-the-third/3030-25725/\" slug=\"saints-row-the-third\">Saints Row: The Third</a> since its release last year, but Genkibowl VII marks the first actual new gameplay that's been bolted onto the open world of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3602\" href=\"/steelport/3035-3602/\" slug=\"steelport\">Steelport</a>. Unfortunately, there isn't much to it, so unless you're positively desperate for a few new side activities--most of which are light overhauls of activities that already appear in the main game--save your money.</p><p style=\"\">As the name \"Genkibowl\" might imply, the activities found in this pack add to the legacy of the twisted <a data-ref-id=\"3005-21352\" href=\"/professor-genki/3005-21352/\" slug=\"professor-genki\">Professor Genki</a>, who runs the somewhat forgettable set of side-missions in the main game that have you running through a murderous game show, gunning down mascots until you earn enough cash to open up the exit. Two more of those missions appear in Genkibowl, albeit with a jungle-themed makeover that mostly just makes the exits harder to find. There are three more activities in this DLC pack, with two instances each. One is an altered version of the escort missions from the main game, except you're rolling around in a car armed with <a data-ref-id=\"3055-45\" href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" slug=\"flamethrower\">flamethrowers</a> as you try to keep Professor Genki safe from harm and run people over to fill up a meter. Another takes the tank mayhem side-missions and replaces the tank with a large yarn ball that can fire off a few shockwaves. This almost gives it a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-402\" href=\"/katamari-damacy/3025-402/\" slug=\"katamari-damacy\">Katamari Damacy</a> sort of feel, but the control you have over the large yarn ball is kind of crappy. The ball feels like it's being crammed into the game against its will, and it seems to get hung up on corners and stuck in the environment a little too often.</p><p style=\"\">The final activity is actually new, and it has you skydiving while wearing a panda suit that, for no good reason, lets you glide around without losing much altitude. This one has you doing a combination between bouncing on large balloons, flying through burning rings, and landing on the rooftops to cut up a few mascots with a chainsaw. The control is terrible. Once I got used to it, I completed both versions of the activity and took solace in the knowledge that I'd never need to do that ever again. And that's it. Eight activities, six of which lightly flip things that you already did in the main game. The best part about Saints Row: The Third is its sense of humor, and there's a bit of that here. The DLC opens and closes with some decent cutscenes, though a lot of that feeling comes from the way they expertly use the <i><a data-ref-id=\"3030-34188\" href=\"/monday-night-football/3030-34188/\" slug=\"monday-night-football\">Monday Night Football</a></i> theme (Johnny Pearson's \"Heavy Action,\" not some sort of silly-ass country music). The ending cutscene has your character speak, and the ending speech is pretty funny, but he/she is wearing a panda costume that, much like the beginning of the main game, \"distorts\" the voice. This prevented the developers from having to record the end speech seven times to account for all the different voice options. That's pretty weak.</p><p style=\"\">If you ended up with the Saints Row: The Third season pass, well, all you can do is grit your teeth and hope the next two packs are more inventive than this one. And sure, calling in a ball of yarn via the vehicle delivery function is pretty goofy, but it's not enough.

Seriously, don't. It's really frustrating when you do.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That's perhaps fitting, given that NeverDead's conception of immortality is something akin to Sisyphean torment. Its lead character, the blandly grizzled <a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/3/34626/1629761-bryce.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bryce Boltzmann</a>, has lived for centuries thanks to an ill-defined curse by some manner of demonic asshole. When mortal injury strikes Bryce, he doesn't so much get hurt as he does just kind of burst apart at the seams. Remember those old <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Incredible_Crash_Dummies\" rel=\"nofollow\">Incredible Crash Test Dummies</a> action figures? The ones that exploded at the arms, legs, and neck if you breathed on them too hard? That's Bryce in a nutshell.</p><p style=\"\">That's also NeverDead's sole distinction. Rebellion has centered the entirety of this aggressively unpleasant character action game's design around Bryce's constantly crumbling frame. The slightest brush from a nearby enemy will send any number of limbs flying, which Bryce then has to scramble to pick back up (or find a nearby regeneration icon to magically regrow them). It's even nuttier when Bryce's skull pops off, in that you suddenly find yourself in control of a severed head that feels a little bit like what would happen if a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-29\" href=\"/katamari/3055-29/\" slug=\"katamari\">Katamari</a> could verbally curse its own existence.</p><p style=\"\">When you aren't frantically trying to reassemble yourself, you're fighting off generically grotesque demon grunts in rooms that receive those wonderful magical demon barriers that block the exit until you've killed every last one of them, as well as the \"womb\" that barfs them out ceaselessly until you destroy it. You can choose to do so either with the game's clunky gun combat--aiming barely functions at all unless you go into the more precise aiming mode, which also happens to slow you down immensely--or use Bryce's comically oversized sword, which you can't swing unless you press the lock-on button, and then use the right analog stick to swing with. Imagine the shot stick in <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1\" href=\"/electronic-arts/3010-1/\" slug=\"electronic-arts\">EA's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3025-675\" href=\"/nhl/3025-675/\" slug=\"nhl\">NHL</a> series, but about a thousand times less functional; that's the idea here.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The controls and combat aiming are cumbersome enough without NeverDead's myriad camera problems. Thanks to your general inability to see what the hell is going on around you, battles tend to devolve into chaotic messes in which you just swing your sword wildly and assume you're hitting things. The destructible environments--which are pretty much NeverDead's sole visual element worth lauding--also do damage to enemies, so in a sense, your best bet in most non-boss combat scenarios is to just wave your sword around like a crazed lunatic and explode every piece of scenery you can, because odds are some of that stuff will hit enemies and kill them, or maybe your sword will, or maybe they'll just knock your head off and it'll get sucked up by those skull-eating demons that skitter around every single level.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1865193-ssgc03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1865193\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1865193-ssgc03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1865193\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1865193-ssgc03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>What is this even supposed to be?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That's NeverDead's way of creating some semblance of a \"lose\" condition. After all, Bryce is technically immortal, so how do you create a game around a guy you can't kill? By bringing out demons that will suck up your severed head in a second, if you aren't careful. Once it does devour your head, a brief, timing-based minigame pops up that, if successful, flings your head back out into the battle zone. If you fail, your head remains in that demon's digestive tract forever.</p><p style=\"\">It's a potentially amusing little spin on the idea of video game death that becomes decidedly unamusing when you bump up against NeverDead's half-busted physics. Once your head pops off, your body goes all rag doll, and sometimes lands in positions that makes it nigh-on impossible to actually reattach yourself. Never mind that you're a pitiful head rolling around a dizzying and chaotic battlefield in which demons will often knock you back dozens of feet just by bumping into you. In one level section, I spent upwards of 10 minutes just trying to reattach my head. Whether it was getting sucked into a demon's belly, getting knocked back to the opposite side of the level, or getting knocked into a wall I literally could not escape from without restarting from the last checkpoint, every single possible factor combined to award this moment as one of the single most irritating gameplay experiences I've ever endured.</p><p style=\"\">Incidentally, that award only lasted for about four hours, because later in the game, I came across the game's second-to-last boss, which then ripped that dubious award away for itself. To put it succinctly, NeverDead's boss fights are obnoxious, laborious affairs that test your patience far more than your skill. Everything is pretty much just a variation on \"hit the weak point until it morphs into something else, then hit that something else's weak point,\" with only the occasional life-regenerating quirk thrown in for good measure. It's bad in the beginning, still bad in the middle, and by the time you get to the last couple of boss fights, you'll wish you'd never put this disc in your console to begin with. There is challenge, there is frustration, and then somewhere, thousands of feet beyond frustration, there is NeverDead, gleefully flipping you off as you endure yet another horrendous boss fight.</p><p style=\"\">What's really baffling about NeverDead is how utterly pointless all of it feels. Even the most superfluously silly games usually try to justify their existence in some way, either by being somewhat funny, or doing something that feels remotely unique. Instead, NeverDead puts all of its chips on its barely-amusing-for-a-minute dismemberment gimmick, and then proceeds to do absolutely nothing to build out the rest of the world around it. It's as if someone with a genuine disdain for the games of <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89591\" href=\"/goichi-suda/3040-89591/\" slug=\"goichi-suda\">Suda 51</a> sat there, trying to pick apart what it is that people like so damn much about his works, then proceeded to didactically try to assemble those ideas into a game without ever completely understanding them.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1470159-neverdead_image_for_gamesco.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470159\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1470159-neverdead_image_for_gamesco.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1470159\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1470159-neverdead_image_for_gamesco.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1470159-neverdead_image_for_gamesco.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Presumably Arcadia is there to titillate, but all she does is irritate.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Nowhere is this more apparent than in the game's story, which might as well not even exist. The back story of Bryce is told through a few cheesy cutscenes in which we learn all about how he and his demon-hunting wife were defeated by the earlier-mentioned demonic jerk, leaving her dead and him forever cursed. Knowing this back story does little to endear Bryce to the audience, as the tragedy of his former life and the shittiness of his current life never quite come together into something you'll remotely care about.</p><p style=\"\">The real issue is that Bryce's role as a modern day demon hunter is severely underwritten. He's a pile of really annoying one-liners--most of which involve hacky passes at his female compatriot, a non-immortal human named <a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/3/34626/1629768-arcadiao.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Arcadia</a>--and no actual personality. He bitches <i>ad infinitum</i> whenever he loses a limb, repeating the same three or four lines until you actually get around to regrowing whatever limb he lost. His sexual deviancy and utter disregard for personal hygiene elicit mild chuckles during their first couple of examples, but by the hundredth time you've heard Bryce crack the same basic one-liner he's been cracking all game long, you'll really wish he could be killed. Immediately.</p><p style=\"\">The surrounding cast and plot is no better. Your companion Arcadia is written as little more than sarcastic cleavage that you have to rescue a tad too often (except when you can't because demons keep knocking your damn head off). The demons you hunt are largely bland monsters devoid of personality. The sole exception is <a href=\"http://media.giantbomb.com/uploads/13/134743/1865190-sangriarender.jpg\" rel=\"nofollow\">Sangria</a>, a Duke of Hell with the personality of a Southern dandy and the visual aesthetic of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TrzkFmzd9Xo&amp;feature=related\" rel=\"nofollow\">Mark McKinney's Chicken Lady</a> by way of a catastrophic acid trip. He's such an over-the-top goof that at a point, I almost started rooting for him to make good on his evil plan and dispatch Bryce and company. That evil plan, by the way, inexplicably involves a petulant teenage pop singer who looks like she wandered in out of a dinner theater production of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8985\" href=\"/final-fantasy-x-2/3030-8985/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-x-2\">Final Fantasy X-2</a>.

Suda 51 has made his reputation crafting very strange games around very strange characters who sometimes aren't immediately likable. The difference between what Suda does and what Rebellion has done here is that Suda still finds time to add layers to his characters that make them far more interesting than they initially appear. Even a chucklehead badass like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32684\" href=\"/shadows-of-the-damned/3030-32684/\" slug=\"shadows-of-the-damned\">Shadows of the Damned's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16583\" href=\"/garcia-hotspur/3005-16583/\" slug=\"garcia-hotspur\">Garcia Hotspur</a> morphs into something far more interesting as that game goes along, due in no small part to unexpected character touches and unpredictable humor. The writers of NeverDead never find a way to deliver any more than the expected. Bryce never morphs into anything beyond what we expect him to become. His personality never grows into anything worth laughing at, let alone sympathize with.</p><p style=\"\">And that's not even to mention the variety of technical gaffes and awkwardly built mechanics that permeate much of NeverDead's experience. Certainly Suda's games are known for their sometimes frustrating jankiness, but that's pretty much all NeverDead consists of. It's all of the jank with none of the charm.</p><p style=\"\">I haven't even mentioned NeverDead's multiplayer component--a cooperative arena battle style mode that brings to bear all the worst traits of the single-player combat, and somehow makes things even more chaotic--but at this point, do I really need to? Nothing about NeverDead works, even when it's working as intended. No amount of perfunctory challenge maps can make up for a game design so functionally lazy, so utterly indifferent to your enjoyment, that it can't even be bothered to make its lone gimmick work even slightly well within its hacked-together world. If the developers in charge of NeverDead didn't care enough to make it a remotely enjoyable experience, why should you care enough to bother with it?</p>", "deck": "NeverDead's one-note dismemberment gimmick wears out its welcome long before you reach the game's miserable conclusion.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-459/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31803/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/neverdead/3030-31803/", "id": 31803, "name": "NeverDead"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2012-02-02 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114626/", "id": 114626, "name": "NeverDead"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/resident-evil-revelations-review/1900-460/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70593/2011149-full12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2011149\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70593/2011149-full12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2011149\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70593/2011149-full12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hold still while I pop that thing.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In an effort to get the most out of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31737\" href=\"/resident-evil-revelations/3030-31737/\" slug=\"resident-evil-revelations\">Resident Evil: Revelations</a>, I ended up lying on my bed in the dark with two pillows propping the 3DS up in front of me. Making yourself play in those kinds of restrictive conditions seems antithetical to the portable nature of the 3DS, but then it's hard to immerse yourself in Revelations' creepy atmosphere when you're riding the bus, hanging out in a busy airport terminal, or playing in most of the places you're likely to get out a handheld. Just by virtue of playing out on the small screen, Revelations was never going to scare you like its best predecessors. The kernel of a great, classic-feeling <a data-ref-id=\"3025-397\" href=\"/resident-evil/3025-397/\" slug=\"resident-evil\">Resident Evil</a> game is in here, but the limitations of the format and some offputting storytelling techniques keep it from joining the ranks of the best entries in the series.</p><p style=\"\">You'd expect a game called \"Revelations\" to offer some, you know, insight into the greater Resident Evil mythology. Moreover, this game's supposed placement on the timeline right between Resident Evils <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\" href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" slug=\"resident-evil-4\">4</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\" href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/\" slug=\"resident-evil-5\">5</a> allows a perfect opportunity to tie into the events that led into the latter game, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-626\" href=\"/jill-valentine/3005-626/\" slug=\"jill-valentine\">Jill Valentine</a> becoming <a data-ref-id=\"3005-627\" href=\"/albert-wesker/3005-627/\" slug=\"albert-wesker\">Wesker</a>'s mind-controlled slave and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-413\" href=\"/chris-redfield/3005-413/\" slug=\"chris-redfield\">Chris Redfield</a> linking up with new partner <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1085\" href=\"/sheva-alomar/3005-1085/\" slug=\"sheva-alomar\">Sheva Alomar</a>. Aside from the BSAA's peripheral involvement and a throwaway reference to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-284\" href=\"/africa/3035-284/\" slug=\"africa\">Africa</a> toward the end, though, Revelations foregoes any intriguing links to other RE games in favor of offering a totally self-contained storyline. The plot involves competing anti-bio-weapon task forces, the new bio-terrorist organization Veltro, and, um, a gleaming futuristic aquapolis that gets overrun by rampaging BOWs. And there's a satellite that shoots sun-lasers? Considering none of this stuff has ever really been mentioned before or since in other Resident Evil games, all these goings-on feel disconnected from the rest of the franchise. By the end of the game, what passes for the story's meager revelations fall flat in that broader series context. It doesn't help that there's hardly anything in the story that actually suggests when in the RE timeline the game happens, or that you should even care when it does in the first place.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70593/2011141-full4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2011141\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70593/2011141-full4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2011141\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70593/2011141-full4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The environment scanner adds an additional mechanic to the story mode.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The best idea Revelations has is to set most of the game aboard an opulent pleasure cruise liner-turned-floating bio-weapon research lab. That setting, with its grand banquet hall and other antique-looking luxuries, immediately recalls the original Resident Evil and the tense, claustrophobic sense of place its oppressively creepy mansion brought about. Revelations' mansion-on-the-sea approach is equally sound, and there's a fairly lengthy section in the middle of the story where it feels like the game has finally abandoned you there, forcing you to explore every room and utilize all your abilities to find keys with anchors inscribed on them to make it through. But the plot is broken up into an unnecessary episodic format that works against you ever really feeling like you're trapped in the inescapable grip of the ship, since you're frequently being whisked away from Jill Valentine and her shipboard plight, and forced to play as other characters in less-interesting places. Most of those new characters run the gamut from dull to ridiculous to vaguely offensive. One of your team members goes by the callsign Jackass and sounds like a Three Stooges reject, while Chris' new partner Jessica is so needlessly sexualized that when she finally lands on the ship ready for action, she appears in a skin-tight catsuit that leaves one leg entirely bare and the other wrapped in purple stripes. Resident Evil has gotten away with (and arguably benefited from) a certain amount of cheese in the past, but much of what isn't Chris or Jill in Revelations just feels silly and out of place.</p><p style=\"\">Even if some of what's going on is kind of ludicrous, at least it looks nice while it's happening. We probably haven't seen everything the 3DS is capable of yet, but at the current moment Revelations' production values are pretty impressive for a handheld game. The characters are detailed enough, and--more importantly for a Resident Evil game--there's a robust enough lighting model that's used in the right ways to create a set of appropriately moody environments. Some parts of the game don't really look like they were meant to be viewed in 3D; specifically, a good number of the textures give an ugly moire effect when you've got 3D on that disappears when you turn it off. But on the whole the game makes a strong impression technically, and the music and sound design might as well be coming out of a console if you play the game with decent headphones on.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70593/2011148-full11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2011148\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70593/2011148-full11.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2011148\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70593/2011148-full11.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70593/2011148-full11.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Raid mode gives you some more missions to play after the story, if you want to keep shooting BOWs.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">By default the game clings to the over-the-shoulder Resident Evil 4 style of gameplay, which means you won't be moving your character and aiming your weapon at the same time. That should be fine for anyone who's stuck with the series so far, but the small screen and small controls make the combat feel awkward on occasion, especially in places where overly tight camera angles make it damn near impossible to see the enemies coming at you. The enemies also don't transition very clearly into their death animations, so I ended up dumping more ammo into a lot of foes than was necessary to actually kill them. You have a dodge move that will theoretically help you avoid taking damage when you're cornered, but I found the timing on that move so finicky that I never felt like I'd properly mastered it by the end of the game.</p><p style=\"\">Despite all that clunkiness, I did find myself getting genuinely sucked into the game's fight for survival from time to time, and the requisite jump scares did their job effectively when I was playing in my carefully constructed chamber at home. The gameplay is also nicely enhanced by a few peripheral systems. You can upgrade all of your weapons with sets of collectible mods that tweak damage values, firing rates, chance to stun enemies, and so on. There's also a running set of in-game achievements that challenge you to complete some boilerplate objectives (like dodge 20 enemy attacks, scan 15 collectibles, and finish the first three episodes) to unlock some new in-game gear. And you've got a first-person scanning device to use in the story mode to uncover extra items and collectible handprints scattered around the environment.

There's a whole separate metagame attached to the raid mode where you level up multiple characters and buy new weapons and gear with both battle points that you earn in the campaign and Play Coins you get from walking around with your 3DS. It's nice that there's some depth and customizability to the raid missions, and they'll give you something to do if you want to keep playing after the story is over, but the game's action isn't good enough on its own that I wanted to go back and spend a lot of time on those missions after the fact.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70593/2011151-full14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2011151\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:60.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/70593/2011151-full14.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2011151\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70593/2011151-full14.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/70593/2011151-full14.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Small screen, mostly small scares.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Of course, if you want Revelations to play like a proper third-person shooter that lets you move around and shoot at the same time, you can always slap the $20 Circle Pad Pro (hitting retail the same day as Revelations) onto your 3DS. But that adds a significant amount of weight and bulk to the 3DS' nice, compact design, and making that tradeoff for slightly better controls just wasn't worth it to me. Your mileage may vary, and the Circle Pad will be useful for a few other upcoming games, but to me it's not worth making Revelations half again more expensive and increasing the size of the system that much just to get marginally better controls.</p><p style=\"\">That's the fundamental issue with shoehorning a big, console-style game like Resident Evil into a form factor the size of the 3DS. You just can't get a game that plays as well or makes as big a visual impact as it would on a big TV, and if you start bolting peripherals onto the system to alleviate those problems, you start to negate what makes the system elegant in the first place. Revelations could have mitigated the effects of its limitations with a more memorable story and more appealing (and maybe more familiar) characters, but the game doesn't deliver enough on any one level to make it easily recommendable if you aren't a diehard fan. Revelations isn't exactly a bad Resident Evil game, but the series has certainly seen better.</p>", "deck": "Viewed as a handheld game, Revelations is impressive enough, but in the long history of the Resident Evil series, it's just average.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-460/", "platforms": "Nintendo 3DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31737/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/resident-evil-revelations/3030-31737/", "id": 31737, "name": "Resident Evil: Revelations"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-02-06 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101596/", "id": 101596, "name": "Resident Evil: Revelations"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-darkness-ii-review/1900-461/", "description": "<p style=\"\">At this point in time, it's probably safe to assign the \"cult classic\" badge to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1768\" href=\"/starbreeze-studios-ab/3010-1768/\" slug=\"starbreeze-studios-ab\">Starbreeze's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9201\" href=\"/the-darkness/3030-9201/\" slug=\"the-darkness\">The Darkness</a>.

The tone and feel of The Darkness was something oddly specific that you'd be right to fear wouldn't come through after being filtered through an entirely different studio and its own proprietary game engine. Fortunately, somehow, some way, Digital Extremes pulled it off. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22425\" href=\"/the-darkness-ii/3030-22425/\" slug=\"the-darkness-ii\">The Darkness II</a> is a game that effectively channels the brooding atmosphere and brutal, fast-paced combat of the original while managing to insert a few quirks of its own that actually benefit the overall experience. Most importantly, the plot retains the sometimes hopeless, always vengeful flavor of the original game, keeping its hooks in you all the way through to the story's intriguing conclusion. It's not mechanically perfect by any stretch, and the campaign does lose some steam toward the very end, but the overall balance of The Darkness leans far heavier toward the pleasurable than the unlikable.</p><p style=\"\">The Darkness II finds series antihero Jackie Estacado two years removed from the adventures of the first game. For those who haven't played the first game (you really ought to), the story does start out with an optional preamble that explains the basic elements of the original plot. It's a brief overview, but it's more than satisfactory, especially for those just looking for a refresher course on what previously took place.</p><p style=\"\">In those two years, Jackie has managed to contain the dark essence within him, the demonic force that appears as sentient tentacles Jackie can command to brutally murder anyone in his path. Of course, that Darkness also has the ability to consume his very soul, hence why Jackie, having removed the antagonists of the previous game and slid into the role of a major New York City crime boss, has done his best to keep those powers under wraps...that is, until one fateful night. The Darkness II certainly kicks off with a bang, with a gangland assassination attempt by anonymous creeps inside a fancy Italian restaurant. It's not long before things go sideways, and suddenly Jackie is forced to call on his Darkness powers to save him from death.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123353-evolution0365.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123353\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123353-evolution0365.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123353\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2123353-evolution0365.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The only way this guy could look any more evil is if he was actually eating a baby in front of you.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But who are these guys? Why are they trying to kill Jackie? And who is this mysterious cripple who keeps popping up to say cryptically threatening things? It doesn't take long to find out. If The Darkness II has one story flaw, it's that it reveals many of its motivations pretty early on. You don't have to get too far into the story before you discover what it is that's propelling the occultist sect at the heart of the story. (They want to suck the Darkness straight out of Jackie's body and use it to take over the world, of course.). In fact, you pretty much figure all that out before Jackie even does. Not that such lack of knowledge would prevent Jackie from running around and killing a bunch of people anyway. He certainly does plenty of that, and with aplomb.</p><p style=\"\">While the core storyline sounds pretty straightforward and nowhere near as nuanced as the story of the first game, it's in the smaller moments that The Darkness II truly shines. The script, penned by <i>The Darkness</i> comic series writer <a data-ref-id=\"3040-37653\" href=\"/paul-jenkins/3040-37653/\" slug=\"paul-jenkins\">Paul Jenkins</a>, keeps the player guessing less by obfuscating the goals of its antagonists, and more by focusing heavily on Jackie's own personal torment over the death of his girlfriend Jenny in the last game. Early on Jackie begins hallucinating, seeing visions of Jenny that blur the line between past memories and current reality. Jenkins also takes a cue from reality-bending films like <i><a href=\"http://www.screened.com/twelve-monkeys/16-170382/\" rel=\"nofollow\">Twelve Monkeys</a></i>, shifting the player's known reality of Jackie as a mob boss to a mental hospital featuring people from his life as both patients and doctors. In the mental ward universe, Jackie's powers, lifestyle, and tragic history are all part of an elaborate delusion. The mixture of torment over Jenny's soul perhaps lingering in Hell and the constant questioning of which reality is even true makes for a much more interesting tale than the core \"bad guys want the thing you have so go kill them\" plotline, even if it doesn't always take full advantage of the possibilities those elements introduce.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Even in those moments where Jackie's motivations are fueled purely by murderous hate, the writing and voice acting keep you fully engaged with Jenkins' story. The Darkess had incredible voice talent that lent itself brilliantly to the sort of hyperviolent mob tale it was spinning, and Darkness II is absolutely no different. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-78378\" href=\"/brian-bloom/3040-78378/\" slug=\"brian-bloom\">Brian Bloom</a> is perhaps an even better voice for Jackie than original actor <a data-ref-id=\"3040-82283\" href=\"/kirk-acevedo/3040-82283/\" slug=\"kirk-acevedo\">Kirk Acevedo</a>, giving him just the right mix of grizzled hatred and weary pathos inherent to the character's current lot in life. From the various mobsters that make up Jackie's organization, to the sneering, hissing bad guys that make up the hated Brotherhood, everyone in The Darkness II does their part to immerse you completely in the story it's telling. And, of course, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-82285\" href=\"/mike-patton/3040-82285/\" slug=\"mike-patton\">Mike Patton</a> returns to once again lend his utterly creepy voice to the Darkness itself. Depending on your level of appreciation for said voice in the first game, is either a blessing or a detriment. Personally, I dig what he does, but I know some out there find him intolerable.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123370-reviewonly.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123370\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2123370-reviewonly.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123370\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2123370-reviewonly.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2123370-reviewonly.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Paul Jenkins' script shifts Jackie's perception of reality in clever, interesting ways.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As you go through The Darkness II's campaign, you will kill a lot of bad guys. Like, <i>a lot.</i> Especially considering that the campaign itself only runs somewhere between six and seven hours. While that sounds pretty short, I honestly can't think of anything else the game really could have done to pad out its length. Perhaps it could have spaced out a few of its revelations a bit more in the early goings, but by the time you get toward its conclusion, there's not really anywhere else for it to go. It makes good use of the time it has, and manages to space out its combat sequences in such a way to where you rarely feel like you're being inundated with bad guys for no good reason.</p><p style=\"\">Even when the game is flinging bad guys at you in heavy succession, the combat in The Darkness II is strong enough to make that feel more like a treat than an annoyance. Jackie has his usual array of guns (pistols, shotguns, assault rifles, and whatnot), as well as a host of new Darkness powers, including the expected tentacle slash attacks and execution moves. While the first game sometimes felt a bit repetitive simply because the array of abilities you had was somewhat limited, The Darkness II attempts to alleviate this by including a new skill tree system. As you kill enemies, you'll earn dark essence you can use to upgrade your weapons, your health, and even add to your array of Darkness kills. This is one of those rare games that leans heavily on \"execution moves\" for morbid thrill where I actually didn't get bored with them right away. There's a solid variety of kills, and the animations are often quick (and hysterically brutal) enough that even seeing them a few times in rapid succession is still a hoot. The one where the tentacle pulls the guy's spinal column out of his ass is perhaps my favorite, though I shudder to think what that says about me as a person.</p><p style=\"\">These skill tree upgrades effectively replace the mostly unnecessary side missions of the first game. There is no real exploration or branching in the story to speak of this time around. The level designs are relatively linear, and save for a few moments where you control your Darkling buddy (a British-accented demon who enjoys pissing on corpses) through tiny vents and other crawlspaces, pretty much all you do in the game is shoot and eviscerate stuff. It is perhaps a testament to the pace and flow of the combat that I never really got tired of doing exactly that.</p><p style=\"\">I certainly did get a bit flustered toward the end, where the developers clearly ran out of ways to upgrade the enemies in interesting ways and instead morphed them into bullet sponges equipped with seemingly unlimited quantities of light grenades (light, as you may recall, renders your Darkness powers unavailable, meaning you'll be shooting out a lot of street lights and flood lamps). It's one thing when they're decked out in Darkness-powered armor that's tough to crack, but it's quite another when it's just some schlub in a Brotherhood-issue turtleneck with a submachine gun who needs six shotgun blasts to go down. Some of those sequences are downright flustering, though thankfully there are only a handful of truly annoying moments.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2076644-vendettas2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2076644\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2076644-vendettas2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2076644\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2076644-vendettas2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2076644-vendettas2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Vendettas multiplayer campaign maybe isn't the most necessary thing in the world, but it's an amusing enough diversion.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Once you're done with the game, you have the option of going back through with all your abilities intact via the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-150\" href=\"/new-game-plus/3015-150/\" slug=\"new-game-plus\">New Game Plus</a> mode, or you can tackle The Darkness II's multiplayer side story. Titled Vendettas, this section of the game owes more than a bit of its design to the core concepts behind the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1342\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3025-1342/\" slug=\"left-4-dead\">Left 4 Dead</a> series. You can choose to play as one of four different characters, each a cheerfully stereotypical (but not quite racist) caricature of one ethnicity or another that comes with their own unique Darkness powers. It's a two-hour campaign that traces some of the off-camera moments briefly mentioned in the main story, but mostly it's an excuse for you and a few friends to bludgeon, stab, and shoot the living hell out of anything unfortunate enough to cross your murderous path.</p><p style=\"\">It's an intriguing diversion of a mode that might have been more were the developers a tad more adventurous with it. The combat is certainly satisfying in this mode as well, but the number of powers each character has is more limited, as are the number of skill upgrades available to you. The short length of the multiplayer campaign lessens the repetitive feel of it a smidgen, but save for those out for <a data-ref-id=\"3015-29\" href=\"/achievements/3015-29/\" slug=\"achievements\">Achievements</a>/<a data-ref-id=\"3015-198\" href=\"/playstation-trophies/3015-198/\" slug=\"playstation-trophies\">Trophies</a>, it's unlikely you'll be inspired to play through it more than once.</p><p style=\"\">The easy argument to make against something like Vendettas is that it took valuable developer time away from the main campaign, but I don't think that argument holds up. Nothing in The Darkness II's story line feels out of place or unnecessary. It doesn't digress needlessly into side missions or other time-wasters designed to just keep you playing for longer stretches. Instead, Digital Extremes believed in the strength of both its combat system and Jenkins' script to inspire players to play through it again once the credits roll. And that confidence was not misplaced. Within an hour of finishing The Darkness II, I was already set to go back in and get my New Game Plus on--something I honestly rarely do. What can I say? The power of The Darkness II compelled me; odds are, it'll do exactly the same for you.</p>", "deck": "Digital Extremes ably picks up where Starbreeze left off, crafting a satisfyingly brutal adventure that only rarely loses its way.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-461/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22425/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-darkness-ii/3030-22425/", "id": 22425, "name": "The Darkness II"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-02-07 11:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-110451/", "id": 110451, "name": "The Darkness II"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning-review/1900-462/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138386/2109915-wmplayer_2012_01_20_23_35_22_77.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2109915\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/138386/2109915-wmplayer_2012_01_20_23_35_22_77.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2109915\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/138386/2109915-wmplayer_2012_01_20_23_35_22_77.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some abilities let you close the gap on your enemies.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In very broad strokes, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30330\" href=\"/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning/3030-30330/\" slug=\"kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning\">Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning</a> is comparable to games in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-174\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls/3025-174/\" slug=\"the-elder-scrolls\">Elder Scrolls</a> series and, to some extent, games in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-182\" href=\"/fable/3025-182/\" slug=\"fable\">Fable</a> series.

You'll be able to call the names of other games out as you see the various things contained in Amalur, but it has a different style and scope than the games you're most likely to compare it to. That's just enough to give it a feel all its own.</p><p style=\"\">The main quest line and the world surrounding it is probably the most gripping thing in all of Reckoning. You begin the game on a slab, as a corpse that marks yet another failed experiment at the Well of Souls, a dark science project designed to let humans and the other less-resilient races of the world come back from the dead, just like the Tuatha--evil elves that reincarnate after death--do. Amalur is also a world governed by fate, with fortune tellers (\"fateweavers\") all over the world able to let individuals know how things will end up. As the first non-immortal to be resurrected, you also re-appear as a blank slate to those weavers. The natural order of things is being upset, and by inserting yourself into various situations, you're literally making a difference in the world. This starts as a quest to figure out who you were before you died and returned--a detail you've conveniently forgotten--but quickly blows up into a quest to save the world. This certainly isn't the first game to deal with these sorts of ideas, but it's done well here just the same.</p><p style=\"\">At the outset, you'll get to choose your character's race and basic appearance, but there's no class choice at the beginning of Reckoning. Instead, you'll place skill points into three different skill trees as you gain experience points and levels. The trees conform to the basic warrior, rogue, and mage archetypes and they'll give you active abilities--like spells and traps and stuff--as well as passive bonuses and additional combat options. As you spend points in the trees, you'll qualify for various destinies. Equipping a destiny gives you a stat bonus that corresponds to the way you've already been spending your points. So if you go strictly into the warrior tree (\"Might\"), you'll get bonuses that help warriors. Spending in the rogue tree (\"Finesse\") unlocks destinies that give you better ranged damage, and spending across multiple trees unlocks destinies like Battlemage, which give characters a boost to magic as well as straight-up fighting. In the end, I found the cross-class destinies to be the most useful, mostly because none of the high-level abilities in any of the trees are all that exciting.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2102778-kingdoms_of_amalur_reckoning_2012_01_11_12_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2102778\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2102778-kingdoms_of_amalur_reckoning_2012_01_11_12_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2102778\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2102778-kingdoms_of_amalur_reckoning_2012_01_11_12_003.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Weapons with magical effects glow to let you know what they're going to do to your foes.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Every time you gain a level, you''ll also be able to spend one point in a separate section of passive skills. This is how you get better at crafting, potion-making, persuasion, detecting hidden objects, picking locks, and so on. You can also find trainers in the world who, for a fee, will give you an extra point in one of your categories. Though some are more useful than others, by the end of the game it was simple to have maxed out every one of these stats.</p><p style=\"\">The game is, as you might expect, broken up into quests. You'll start with quests that are part of the main storyline, but there are also faction-specific quest lines to pursue as well as scads of side quests and tasks strewn throughout the kingdom of Amalur. As a general rule, the better quests are the ones that show up higher in your quest log. The main quest line is pretty good, and it takes you across most of the game's world on its own. The faction quests are also quite good, for the most part, with the House of Ballads quest line probably being my favorite. That line is one of the best at demonstrating how the Summer Fae--these are also immortal elf-like guys, only they don't all want to murder you--view the world. They keep reenacting world events again and again, retelling the same stories for each generation. But with the world changing and fate not being as certain as it used to be, these tellings have gone completely off the rails. Your part in the quest line, if you so choose, is to play a role in these reenactments, killing the ones that need to be killed, saving the ones that need to be saved, and so on. The line serves as a great introduction to what the world is all about, and without it, you'll probably be left struggling to figure out what all this Fae business means for the world around you.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Then there are the side quests. Though there are a few objectives here and there that are reasonably interesting, this part of the quest log gets immediately clogged with menial tasks. This is where the game's dialogue, which is usually pretty well-written, just gets in the way and the game becomes a factory assembly line of quest after quest after quest. Obviously, these are optional tasks, so my recommendation is to skip as many as you see fit. They'll pad out the game and give you a reason to venture into every little cave in the universe, but they also turn what would have been a terrific 25-hour experience into a 60-hour grind. The other problem I ran into as a result of my completionist tactics was that I eventually became way too powerful. By crafting gems that regenerate health when socketed into armor and socketing them into as much as my armor as possible, I effectively became invincible. Most of the enemies out in the world conned as gray, meaning they weren't worthy opponents (not that that fact stops them from attacking you). In caves and other enclosed areas, enemies appear to scale to your level, but by this point I was so powerful that the interesting combat of the early game boiled down to simple button mashing by the end. Nothing could touch me. The optional combo attacks became totally unnecessary. The game lets you change the difficulty on the fly, but the hard setting doesn't change the enemy tactics to make it more challenging. If anything, it appears that it just gives everyone more hit points.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2080833-reckoningdetyrebarghast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2080833\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1152\" style=\"width: 1152px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2080833-reckoningdetyrebarghast.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2080833\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2080833-reckoningdetyrebarghast.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2080833-reckoningdetyrebarghast.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The bigger weapons really tear people up, but you'll have to take care when winding up.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Up until that point, the combo-driven combat felt pretty good. Each style of weapon has its own spots on the skill tree, and you can spend points there to unlock additional attacks that come when charging a button press, or delaying your taps, or attacking from a blocking position, and so on. The combat feels active, especially when compared to the slow, block-and-strike moves of an Elder Scrolls game. You can equip two weapons at the same time, and each weapon gets its own button. If you like, you can combine fast-attacking daggers with a slower hammer or greatsword, but I found the bow to make an excellent secondary weapon for dealing with enemies at a distance.</p><p style=\"\">Loot is sort of a big deal in Reckoning, and it's color-coded to give you an easy way to see an item's rarity. Some armor has slots for gems to let you tweak it to your liking, but there are a ton of different potential effects, like poison damage, fire damage, extra damage during the daytime, better critical hits, bonus health or mana, and so on. When you loot a corpse or a chest, you can easily take all items, but it's also a great time to compare the item you're considering to what you already have equipped. The game makes comparing loot to your existing gear very easy, and if you grab something that isn't useful, you can add it to your junk pile with the touch of a button. The junk system is nice, because once you get to a vendor, you can sell everything you've flagged as junk with one button press. I ended up flagging a ton of things as junk, mostly because the game seems predisposed to giving you gear made for warriors, which often requires you to have spent a specific number of points in the Might tree. By the end of my time with the game, I had over three million gold. That's... a lot of money.</p><p style=\"\">There are plenty of really great things to see and do in Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning, and that stuff--the main quest line, the faction quests, and the interesting combat--makes the game fairly easy to recommend. But it's hard not to be at least a little disappointed when you start seeing the various spots where the game doesn't live up to the high bar set by its best content. If you finish it fast enough to prevent those doldrums from setting in, you'll have a much better time than the person who digs through every nook and cranny to finish every single side quest.</p>", "deck": "Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning creates an interesting world and gives you good combat options, but the whole thing overstays its welcome a bit.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-462/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30330/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/kingdoms-of-amalur-reckoning/3030-30330/", "id": 30330, "name": "Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-02-07 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-112751/", "id": 112751, "name": "Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/gotham-city-impostors-review/1900-463/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2081040-378440_10150430208764285_154253624284_8686158_1610845769_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081040\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2081040-378440_10150430208764285_154253624284_8686158_1610845769_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081040\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2081040-378440_10150430208764285_154253624284_8686158_1610845769_n.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The shooting in this game is fine, but the shooting isn't necessarily the point.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's nothing especially original about <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35307\" href=\"/gotham-city-impostors/3030-35307/\" slug=\"gotham-city-impostors\">Gotham City Impostors</a>' mishmash of multiplayer modes and character progression, but the game goes to such absurd lengths to distinguish itself from the vast field of modern-military mediocrity that you can't help but love it at least a little bit. I thought I was just about done with team deathmatch and carrot-on-a-stick multiplayer unlocks, but those things feel a lot fresher when they're full of vigilante faux-<a data-ref-id=\"3005-66\" href=\"/batman/3005-66/\" slug=\"batman\">Batmen</a> on rollerskates, and mohawk-wearing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-952\" href=\"/the-joker/3005-952/\" slug=\"the-joker\">Joker</a> minions running around spouting high-pitched superhero nonsense.</p><p style=\"\">Mechanically, the game isn't a unique multiplayer shooter, but it's a good one. Capture-and-hold and one-flag CTF modes are mixed in with the team deathmatch, and the shooting feels nice and solid. The requisite character-progression system is robust enough to give you a huge number of options in building out your character, from five body types that dictate your speed and health, to a ton of weapons that range from typical rifles to freeze guns and boomerangs. The perks system feeds into the comic book motif by framing your peripheral abilities as fun facts (like you'd see on a trading card) and a psych profile. And a selection of gadgets--most of which come in the form of modes of transportation--make the gameplay feel more mobile and dynamic than your typical <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty</a> clone, since you can soar around on glider wings or shoot a grapple gun to get you up to higher ledges. Using the gadgets to get around the map quickly is key to winning, especially in the objective game types.</p><p style=\"\">But forget weapon mods and killstreak bonuses. What sets Gotham City Impostors apart is the ludicrous attitude that colors it front to back, from the ridiculousness of the two teams' makeshift Batman and Joker costumes to the frumpy little hand-drawn, business-suited \"Office Bat\" who runs around the game showing you how everything works. In the character creator, you select a voice... and then move a slider that hilariously pitches the voice way up or down. The unlockable costume options include a bath towel for a cape, a Batman mask made out of a cardboard box, and a lack of pants that turns out to be the most expensive piece of non-clothing in the game. When you bring the flag, which is a battery, back to your base, which is a propaganda machine, the people on the other team hear a bunch of subtle suggestions about their inferiority and become so demoralized they can't use weapons for a bit. But they can still flail their arms around helplessly...which is a one-hit kill. There's a refreshing, gleeful devotion to absurdist humor here that reminds me at least passingly of some <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25725\" href=\"/saints-row-the-third/3030-25725/\" slug=\"saints-row-the-third\">other recent games</a>.

Thankfully, leveling up is the only way to access weapons, mods, and other gameplay-relevant trinkets. But you also have the option to pay real cash money for the cosmetic-only costume pieces, as well as some other doohickeys that are only for looks, and a temporary boost to experience. If the game were holding a bunch of content back behind a required paywall, it'd be a lot easier to get incensed about the number of microtransactions stuffed into a game that's already 15 dollars, but since you can access everything that matters just by unlocking it, it's hard to get too worked up about a set of convenience fees that's easy enough to ignore. What you're buying here is strictly a multiplayer game, though there's a big list of offline challenges involving the various gadgets that you can run through to earn experience. And once you rank up, you can join a gang that serves as one of several factions in a persistent turf war that will hopefully encourage people to stick with the game for a decent chunk of time.</p><p style=\"\">It's harder to ignore the problems with the PC version of the game. While I didn't run into the matchmaking issues other players have been reporting, you may have worse luck and find it tough to get a game going. The performance problems I ran into on our ATI-based office PC are unforgivable, though, with a frame rate stuck in the teens at best and occasionally dipping into an outright slideshow--and this was after dropping detail settings down considerably. There, the game was completely unplayable, but on my Nvidia-based home machine the game ran at a perfect 60 frames per second and played great. (Whether there's some kind of GPU-specific driver issue like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20672\" href=\"/rage/3030-20672/\" slug=\"rage\">Rage</a> had at launch is open to speculation.) With all these potential issues, I'd recommend you not go anywhere near the PC version until it's properly patched, although by then, who's to say if the game will still have an active community? It's a shame, because the PC version should by all rights be the best one. I had no trouble playing on both consoles, but the PS3 game had some unsightly texture pop-in, so the 360 version seems like the safest bet right now.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The idea of a multiplayer-only downloadable shooter is a sound one, offering a lower-priced, stripped-down version of that Call of Duty progression model for people who don't care about campaigns and just want to focus on the headshots and skill unlocks. But given that most of the games in that category have been biting Call of Duty on every level, even in appearance and tone, it's been hard to get too excited about any of them. By contrast, Gotham City Impostors shows how far a clear sense of personality and humor can take you even when you're making the same old style of game.</p>", "deck": "The framework of Monolith's new multiplayer shooter might not be wildly original, but its nonsensical humor sure is.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-463/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store, PC, PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35307/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/gotham-city-impostors/3030-35307/", "id": 35307, "name": "Gotham City Impostors"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-02-11 10:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-113585/", "id": 113585, "name": "Gotham City Impostors"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/uncharted-golden-abyss-review/1900-464/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2081452-headquarters_newcombat_06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081452\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2081452-headquarters_newcombat_06.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081452\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2081452-headquarters_newcombat_06.png\"></a><figcaption>Many of the weapons found in the previous Uncharted games appear here, as well.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">When you think about the various things that make up one of the games in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-957\" href=\"/uncharted/3025-957/\" slug=\"uncharted\">Uncharted</a> series, what do you come up with?

Then, break up the climbing and shooting with a few puzzles. Oh, and don't forget to lay in a few huge, cinematic \"set-piece\" moments that are driven by the developer's technical mastery of the hardware at hand.

It pulls together a lot of the things that you'd expect to see and hear in an Uncharted game, but it's missing the things that help set the franchise apart from other action games. In their place, the developers have inserted a bunch of mediocre minigames that have you touching or rubbing the screen or rear touch panel in various ways. If the goal was to use every single piece of functionality that the Vita has to offer, then the developers deserve a huge pat on the back. But the overall quality of the final product suffers as a result of these inclusions, leaving behind an Uncharted game that feels like a carbon copy of the genuine article.</p><p style=\"\">The missing elements are noticeable ones, too.

You won't find any sinking ships, speeding trains, or collapsing buildings here. The thing that's become something of a calling card for the Uncharted franchise is missing, and without those huge sequences, the game lacks punch. You'll occasionally see some pillars fall over or some other basic destruction, but it never quite <i>feels</i> like an Uncharted game. Instead it feels like Drake going through the motions, performing his base-level tasks under decidedly ordinary circumstances.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864590-19152cliffdescent7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864590\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1864590-19152cliffdescent7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1864590\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1864590-19152cliffdescent7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are some majestic background images to see when you get up high, but tilting the Vita to stay balanced on logs is no fun.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The game has Drake paired up with a woman named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-19990\" href=\"/marisa-chase/3005-19990/\" slug=\"marisa-chase\">Marisa Chase</a> as they stumble around <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2906\" href=\"/south-america/3035-2906/\" slug=\"south-america\">South America</a> in an adventure that eventually connects to Esteban the Moor, Marcos de Niza, and the Seven Cities of Gold.

Though the ruins change a bit over the course of the game, the vast majority of the action is set in jungles and caves.</p><p style=\"\">By and large, the game controls like you'd expect an Uncharted game to control. When shooting, the left trigger aims and the right trigger fires. The analog sticks on the Vita are no surprise, either. For the most part, you can opt to play the game almost exactly like you'd play Uncharted on a PlayStation 3, at least whenever you're shooting people (and there are a ton of people that need shooting) or climbing around. Golden Abyss also offers a lot of optional ways to control the action. By default, for example, any time you zoom in with a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">sniper rifle</a>, you can tilt the Vita to aim. Considering this asks you to occasionally tilt the system so far that you can't see the screen anymore, I turned that off pretty quickly. You'll tap the ammo counter in the upper-left to reload your weapons, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenades</a> are tossed by either tapping the touch screen or holding over the grenade icon and dragging them out to the center of the screen, which lets you aim your tosses a bit. Melee attacks can either be done via an on-screen icon or by tapping the enemies directly. Some melee sequences lead into a quick little screen-swiping sequence where you're forced to swipe in a specific direction to succeed. See a bit of bamboo blocking your path? A knife icon appears on-screen, and when you touch it you'll be asked to swipe the screen three times before Drake will begin cutting. The game's big boss fights are, essentially, touch-based <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">Quick Time Events</a> where you need to swipe the screen correctly to keep the momentum moving in your direction. Need to give your partner a boost up onto a ledge? Swipe the screen! None of these things are difficult, but they really pile up and take you out of the moment.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">At some point, the action just begins to feel like a series of touch-based minigames with some shooting and climbing mixed in to break up the touches. In addition to swiping all over the place, you'll also have to rub the screen to take charcoal etchings of symbols or clean up skulls, helmets, swords, and other clues you find along the way. You'll even get to open combination locks with the touchscreen, after which your partner appears to be genuinely impressed by your ability to... work a combination lock, even though she just handed you the combination to the safe. That's just dumb. Optional \"mysteries\" can also be solved by taking photos. Whenever you end up in a spot where a key photo can be taken, a camera icon appears on-screen. Tap it, and you'll get a camera out and see a version of the photo you're supposed to be taking. It's up to you to maneuver yourself into position to take <i>that exact photo</i> in order to get credit. If you're too far off the mark, the game reports that your grade is 95 percent, but you need a full 100. This, too, feels like insanity. You'll also have to stop when crossing logs and narrow beams to \"play\" a bad balance sequence by tilting the Vita.</p><p style=\"\">Again, no one touchscreen moment is awful (actually, the game encouraging you for doing something as dead simple as opening a combination lock is pretty close), but they add up to make the entire experience feel like it's half Uncharted, half lame <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" slug=\"iphone\">iPhone</a> compilation. The only genuinely cool moment I experienced that involved the Vita's additional control features was a bit where text was revealed on an otherwise-blank piece of paper by holding the Vita up to a light source. You can also optionally use the touchscreen to climb ledges by swiping along the path you want Drake to take, which is fine, but it's not like the existing control scheme for that is especially challenging or slow.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90134/1799919-snaketemple_05.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799919\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90134/1799919-snaketemple_05.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1799919\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90134/1799919-snaketemple_05.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90134/1799919-snaketemple_05.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can opt to use tilt and touch to climb around.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps looking for those huge, Uncharted moments on the Vita is a bit much to ask. It's hard to know where the system will ultimately fall with regards to technical strength and graphical capabilities, but for something that Sony has tried to compare to the PlayStation 3 on a technical level, it doesn't take long to see that this ain't no PlayStation 3 game. The lush jungle settings are vibrant and really sell the quality of the Vita's screen, though as you spend time with this full-length adventure, it's easy to pick out a flat-looking texture here and there. More damning, perhaps, is the game's unstable frame rate, which gets worse as you play deeper into the game and the game begins to throw larger environments at you with more frequency. It looks fine, and it's probably one of the more technically impressive games available at launch, but it certainly leaves room for improvement. Again, that's assuming that the Vita is capable of more than this.</p><p style=\"\">The entire experience is anchored by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\" href=\"/nolan-north/3040-80008/\" slug=\"nolan-north\">Nolan North</a>, who reprises his role as Nathan Drake. The writing isn't as sharp and the situation isn't as dire as some of the previous Uncharted games, but Drake's considerable charm is still on display and prepared to make fans of the series feel they're right at home. The supporting characters are also nicely done. The whole thing feels like a \"B Team\" sort of feel to it, but there's just enough Uncharted here to ensure that the experience isn't a total loss. It helps that there isn't any sort of other experience like this available on the Vita right now, though even that is tempered by the game's $50 retail price tag. It's not especially difficult to find a copy of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32982\" href=\"/uncharted-3-drakes-deception/3030-32982/\" slug=\"uncharted-3-drakes-deception\">Uncharted 3</a> for somewhere around that price these days, and paying a price so close to the full console experience to get something that feels watered down and rough around the edges doesn't feel like a particularly good deal. But if you're already sold on the Vita and you're in need of some games, Uncharted: Golden Abyss decently approximates many of the things that have made the franchise so successful in the past.</p>", "deck": "Uncharted: Golden Abyss feels like a made-for-cable version of a proper, big-screen Uncharted adventure.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-464/", "platforms": "PlayStation Vita", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-34017/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/uncharted-golden-abyss/3030-34017/", "id": 34017, "name": "Uncharted: Golden Abyss"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-02-13 06:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-107686/", "id": 107686, "name": "Uncharted: Golden Abyss"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/super-stardust-delta-review/1900-465/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1800199-5789322791_dc7fb3b31e_z.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800199\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5671875\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1800199-5789322791_dc7fb3b31e_z.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800199\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57793/1800199-5789322791_dc7fb3b31e_z.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">After a fairly lackluster prior portable outing for <a data-ref-id=\"3025-584\" href=\"/super-stardust/3025-584/\" slug=\"super-stardust\">Super Stardust</a> on the PSP, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2107\" href=\"/housemarque/3010-2107/\" slug=\"housemarque\">Housemarque</a> has a proper sequel to its <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a> dual-joystick shooter on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-129\" href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" slug=\"playstation-vita\">Vita</a> with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35502\" href=\"/super-stardust-delta/3030-35502/\" slug=\"super-stardust-delta\">Super Stardust Delta</a>. It offers new planets to plow through, new super weapons, and it drops the three weapons of the previous game down to two. Don't mistake that smaller number for a smaller game, though. With additional options and minigames, Delta is just as large as its PS3 counterpart, and it's a strong opener for the Vita's download-only offerings.</p><p style=\"\">For the most part, this is the same game that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-793\" href=\"/super-stardust-hd/3030-793/\" slug=\"super-stardust-hd\">Super Stardust HD</a> was, though it isn't identical. The game takes place on the outer edge of a sphere, and you'll move with one stick and shoot with the other. The Vita's analog sticks are well-suited to this task, and the device's bright screen makes the hectic action easy to follow, though it's still possible to lose your ship during especially chaotic moments as the game is filled with particles and other effects that make the action look nice and flashy. Where HD had three different weapons to power up and use against three different types of targets, Delta instead uses two. The fire beam looks like a burning laser whip that juts out from your craft and snakes around the screen as you flick the right stick back and forth, letting you hose down red-colored enemies. Ice is a blue spread shot that gets a wider firing arc as you collect ice icons, and it's best suited for blue asteroids and enemies. So matching the colors results in devastation, while mismatching them does minimal damage, at best. You can swap between the two weapons by pressing the R trigger, and this feels like a good change to the three-weapon system found in past games, where you'd have to memorize the cycle order for your three weapons in order to always swap to the right gun at the right moment. This game is too fast for that.</p><p style=\"\">Where HD had limited-use <a data-ref-id=\"3015-144\" href=\"/smart-bomb/3015-144/\" slug=\"smart-bomb\">smart bombs</a> that created a radius of death and gave you some breathing room, Delta has three special weapons. In addition to the default bomb, you can also launch a series of homing missiles or create a black hole that sucks asteroids and other smaller objects in. Personally, I still find the default blast to be the most effective. Each of these weapons draws from the same limited stock of special attacks, so you'll need to be conservative with them. You can also utilize a boost that both cuts through asteroids and quickly gets you out of the immediate vicinity. In the default mode, punching the boost button also triggers a quick slow-motion effect. If you like, you can opt for a \"pure\" option that disables the slo-mo and eliminates the two new special weapons, returning your options to those of Super Stardust HD. Also by default, the game lets you tilt the Vita around to move the camera a bit, letting you see around the horizon of the playfield. Depending on the angle you're holding the Vita at, this might be totally disruptive, so you can easily disable this, as well.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1800200-xlarge_04_multi_moon_planet__hq_military_base_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800200\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/57793/1800200-xlarge_04_multi_moon_planet__hq_military_base_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800200\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/57793/1800200-xlarge_04_multi_moon_planet__hq_military_base_copy.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The main mode has 25 stages split across five different planets. Asteroids continually land and stick to the sphere along with various types of enemies. Harvesting asteroids gives you items to collect that give you points, improved weapons, and so on. But the eventual goal is to clear the stage of enemies. The fifth and final phase of each planet pits you against a large boss, most of which aren't too tough, as long as you're being careful. In the event that the game is too rough for you on the normal setting, there's also a casual difficulty that turns the game into something just about anyone could complete. As you get to each planet, you'll unlock minigames, many of which use the touchscreen, rear touch panel, or another Vita-specific control to give you a new task. Some of these, like one that has you using the touch and rear touch to \"pinch\" asteroids to death, work better than others. The game keeps leaderboards for all of these modes and options, and your friends' scores are posted right on the menu screens for easy comparison.</p><p style=\"\">It would probably benefit from an additional mode or two (which, if the trophy list is to be believed, will be coming in the form of a DLC add-on), but with a $10 price tag and a terrific frame rate, Super Stardust Delta makes for a good, strong opener for the Vita's download-only catalog.

The action and the basic modes are mostly intact and it offers a passable number of options for the price. But it can be hard to look past the game's technical issues, which include insane pre-race load times and a frame rate that tends to rob the traditionally breakneck hover racer of its sense of speed. Toss in a UI that's a little too slick for its own good and you end up with something a little more ho-hum than you might be expecting.</p><p style=\"\">As the name might tell you, the game opens in 2048. But in case you haven't internalized the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-205\" href=\"/wipeout/3025-205/\" slug=\"wipeout\">Wipeout</a> timeline by this point, it'd help for you to know that this is the earliest entry in the series, fictionally speaking. It covers 2048 to 2050, but the first Wipeout game is set in 2052. The upshot of all this is that the game's tracks are designed to look a little more like sectioned-off parts of a future city instead of race tracks built specifically for anti-gravity racing. It's sort of a minor distinction that mostly boils down to \"you will see buildings and other city-like structures along the sides of the game's 10 tracks.\" But this at least gives the game a centralized focus and jumping-off point, aesthetically. The team list looks a lot like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3654\" href=\"/wipeout-xl/3030-3654/\" slug=\"wipeout-xl\">Wipeout XL</a>'s, so you'll unlock and control vehicles from <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5146\" href=\"/feisar/3015-5146/\" slug=\"feisar\">Feisar</a>, AG Systems, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7335\" href=\"/qirex/3015-7335/\" slug=\"qirex\">Qirex</a>, Auricom, and Pirhana. Each team has four different ship types that unlock as you earn experience points in events, giving you access to ships balanced in favor of speed, handling, or combat. The fourth ship for each team is a \"prototype\" ship that has unique features. The Feisar prototype, unlockable once you reach level 10, increases its top speed every time you fly over a boost pad, potentially giving it the fastest top speed around if you can keep it from crashing into too many walls. I ended up sticking with the Feisar Speed for most of the game, but in the combat mode you'll probably need something a little tougher.</p><p style=\"\">The game's primary mode is a single-player campaign that gives you a grid of events. It looks like a shinier version of the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2324\" href=\"/ridge-racer-6/3030-2324/\" slug=\"ridge-racer-6\">Ridge Racer 6</a> grid, and it doesn't give you enough information. All the grid shows is the type of event. So you'll know if the next thing is a race, a combat event, and so on. But you won't see which track it's on or what your goal on the track is until you tap into the event. This isn't a huge deal on its own, but the game doesn't have a custom race (what Wipeout HD called \"racebox\") mode to let you build your own events. Want to practice a track? Unless you've opened up the hot lap events that have you racing alone on a track against your ghost, you'll need to clumsily fumble around the campaign menu until you find the right track. The races you need to beat to unlock the prototype vehicles are \"hidden\" on the map, forcing you to scroll around the grid in search of discolored areas that pop out when you rub the rear touch panel.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863753-19023wipeout2048gamescom006_mall.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863753\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863753-19023wipeout2048gamescom006_mall.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863753\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1863753-19023wipeout2048gamescom006_mall.jpg\"></a><figcaption>An in-game photo mode lets you carefully take the screenshot of your dreams.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The actual racing isn't dramatically different from Wipeout's past. By default, the game uses a friendlier control scheme that gives you one air brake button that works in both directions, rather than giving you separate air brakes on the triggers. You can swap that default scheme out for the more traditional Wipeout controls or opt for one that uses the Vita's tilt control. You can side shift and bust out barrel rolls and, if you're feeling crazy, you can tap up on the right stick to spin around and drive in the opposite direction. This little move comes in handy when playing combat events online, since players seem to like to just drive up and down the same small stretch of track, grabbing weapons and blasting each other quickly. It feels like they're probably grinding out XP in an attempt to climb the game's long ladder and unlock all the optional events and ships.</p><p style=\"\">When you're playing alone, the racer AI feels a little <a data-ref-id=\"3015-35\" href=\"/rubber-band-ai/3015-35/\" slug=\"rubber-band-ai\">rubber-banded</a> to keep things close, but the game's default goals don't start out too difficult. Some of the early races require you to finish sixth out of eight racers. That's... not so hard. But as you go deeper into the campaign, the minimum goal gets tougher and the races get faster. Finishing third in the 2050 races can get pretty tricky. In the event that you can't scrape by, the game will ask you if you want to skip an objective after a few failures. This usually happened in race events. Stuff like the combat mode and the great-looking zone mode aren't especially difficult, even at higher levels. You'll also find some optional events, and these usually lead you to trophies, provided you can get the top goal in an event, which usually requires you to finish first or double the normal goal. The eventual task in the campaign is to get an \"Elite Pass\" on every event, which won't be easy.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863751-19021wipeout2048gamescom003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863751\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863751-19021wipeout2048gamescom003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863751\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1863751-19021wipeout2048gamescom003.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1863751-19021wipeout2048gamescom003.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Personally, I'd take a big sacrifice in image quality if it meant getting the frame rate up. This is Wipeout! Speed is everything!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Online, the game gives you a campaign and a different grid to light up, but here you're fed objectives that apply to any event on any track, rather than forcing players into different player matching buckets. The objectives are fairly simple, usually just asking you to \"finish the event\" at the lower levels. Between races, the players (up to 8) in your game vote between two different track/event combos. Combat seemed to get the most votes during my time online, but again, I suspect that's because players were attempting to grind out levels. Or, at least, I hope that was the case, because it's hard to imagine those other people having any lasting fun by playing the same short, boring combat events over and over again. At least the whole thing has great music, with a soundtrack featuring The Prodigy, The Chemical Brothers, Deadmau5, Noisia, Underworld, and more.</p><p style=\"\">If the 2048-specific multiplayer isn't your speed, perhaps the cross-play will be. This lets you get at a few tracks and crafts from Wipeout HD and play with PlayStation 3 players. Unlike the easy player-matching of the 2048 online campaign, though, playing in the cross-play portion of the game requires you to choose a class and track up-front, before the search even begins. It's a pretty neat idea that'd be cool to see make its way into more games. It's also worth noting that, as of this writing, all of the online servers that power the leaderboards and player matching across all modes appear to be down. The game was working fine prior to the US \"early\" launch and I was able to get in with players from other regions and play a bunch of multiplayer, so hopefully this will all be fixed and behind us shortly.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The things you want from a Wipeout game are here, but they're surrounded by a bunch of caveats. The UI to get into a race, as mentioned, is pretty poor and needs more options. The load times, even though a patch was put out to shorten them, are ridiculously lengthy. And once you're in-game, you'll find that, even under the best of circumstances, the game just doesn't <i>feel</i> fast enough. The frame rate is usually pretty stable, but it's stable at a lower rate that makes all the action look choppy and feel sluggish. Add in a bunch of other racers and have them all firing weapons and you'll find that even this less-than-ideal frame rate takes a noticeable hit. With these problems, the whole thing is effectively neutered. The assets are often wonderful, but the execution is decidedly lacking.</p>", "deck": "The pieces of a tremendous Wipeout game are present in 2048, but it's hard to look past the game's annoying interface, wicked-long load screens, and underwhelming sense of speed.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-466/", "platforms": "PlayStation Vita", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35496/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/wipeout-2048/3030-35496/", "id": 35496, "name": "WipEout 2048"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-02-16 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114371/", "id": 114371, "name": "Wipeout 2048"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rayman-origins-review/1900-467/", "description": "<p style=\"\">In my <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31721\" href=\"/rayman-origins/3030-31721/reviews/\" slug=\"rayman-origins\">original review</a> of the console versions of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31721\" href=\"/rayman-origins/3030-31721/\" slug=\"rayman-origins\">Rayman: Origins</a>, I all but called it out as one of the best platformers ever made, and I feel even more strongly about that sentiment now than I even did then.

Now that you presumably have some understanding of the core tenets of Origins' design, we can discuss what does and does not work in the Vita version.</p><p style=\"\">A surprising amount really does work on the Vita. The full single-player campaign from consoles is here, and it's rather amazing how well-rendered it is. The crispness of the 2D art and animation hasn't been watered down in any noticeable ways. Rayman's goofball movements and the myriad bizarre happenings spread across the game's various worlds still look absolutely beautiful, and in a neat, Vita-specific touch, you can now pinch the screen to zoom in or out. This lets you zoom out to see if any hidden areas are nearby, or simply zoom in to take in some of the more colorfully gorgeous details in the world.</p><p style=\"\">The tight control of the console versions pretty much carries over here, too. That's important, because big swaths of Origins' gameplay require fairly precise timing and movement. As I said previously, it's a challenging game that only toward the very end becomes something more frustratingly difficult, but by the time you get there, your mastery of the controls and Rayman's abilities ought to help salve that a bit. On Vita, there is no reason why that wouldn't hold true as well, as Rayman controls just as well as he did on the previous platforms.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">So, what is different, then? For starters, the cooperative multiplayer, which was such a delight on consoles, is now absent. Granted, the cooperative play was essentially an optional bonus for the main story campaign that players could essentially drop in and out of any time they pleased, and it was never online to begin with, meaning there was no netcode for Ubisoft to rejigger for the Vita version's purposes--though to be fair, other Vita launch titles do include local multiplayer functionality of some fashion. Again, the levels never changed in any way during co-op, but the play experience did, since combining abilities among characters often led to new, sometimes far more exciting solutions to existing obstacles. It's a shame, albeit not an unexpected one, that it's been excised here.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2130035-2012_02_16_141016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2130035\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2130035-2012_02_16_141016.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2130035\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2130035-2012_02_16_141016.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The lack of multiplayer is a bummer, but the core experience is still great regardless.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps as something of a make-good for the lack of multiplayer, the Vita version's developers included a new ghost mode, for those obsessed players who dig replaying levels for better times and jockeying for leaderboard position. It's a nifty little addition, but it's hardly a suitable replacement for something as great as Origins' co-op play.</p><p style=\"\">On that note, the question now becomes who, specifically, this version of Origins is for. The only real caveats here are whether you'd want to play with friends, or if you've already picked up one of the console versions in the past. If you're new to the game and have no particular interest in playing cooperatively with anyone, ever, then this version is entirely worthwhile. So much of what made Rayman: Origins great on consoles--from the glorious visuals and music on down to the wonderfully crafted gameplay--translate just about perfectly on the Vita.

What makes this game different than the handful of additional versions that came between now and then? Mechanically, not much. This puzzle game has appeared on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-88\" href=\"/playstation-network-ps3/3045-88/\" slug=\"playstation-network-ps3\">PlayStation Network</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">Xbox Live Arcade</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-94\" href=\"/pc/3045-94/\" slug=\"pc\">PC</a>... even a second PSP release and a <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">PlayStation 2</a> version of the game appeared. Maybe it's just something about the <i>feel</i> of a <a data-ref-id=\"3010-313\" href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" slug=\"sony-computer-entertainment-america\">Sony</a> handheld that makes Lumines feel special. Or maybe it's the quality of the screens found on both the PSP (which was amazing in its day) and the Vita (which is amazing right now). Those things certainly help, but great graphical design and a terrific soundtrack are the things that drive <a data-ref-id=\"3030-36359\" href=\"/lumines-electronic-symphony/3030-36359/\" slug=\"lumines-electronic-symphony\">Lumines: Electronic Symphony</a>.</p><p style=\"\">If you're just joining us, Lumines is a well-based puzzle game where you deal with two different block colors. You want to form squares with those blocks. Squares get wiped from your well as a time line sweeps across the screen, letting you combo your block removals together by building multiple squares during each screen sweep. The tempo of the time line is governed by music, and as you proceed the song will change, giving the game a bit of a rhythmic element. At its core, this is a dependable idea that is satisfying on its own. Wrapping changing music and visuals around it in the form of different skins only deepens the potential obsession level.</p><p style=\"\">Electronic Symphony doesn't play around with the core of this design, but it does add a bit of customization to its main mode. When you play, you can choose a specific avatar, as before. But now, the avatars come stocked with a specific ability that can be built up and used when it's fully charged. These might impact the blocks that come your way by giving you three solid-colored squares in a row. Or, if you'd rather, you can select an avatar that can stop the time line completely for a little bit, carving out a spot for you to land a gigantic combo. The abilities charge up incredibly slowly on their own, but you can charge them up pretty quickly by slapping around the Vita's rear touch panel. It's an interesting idea that flounders a bit because constantly tapping the back of the screen gets kind of annoying. Also, that tapping makes a specific noise in the game that just detracts from the rest of the audio. Everything else, from the sound of dropping blocks to rotating your current piece makes skin-specific sound that tends to fit pretty well with the action. The tapping noise sticks out in a bad way, snapping you out of the trance-like state that the rest of the game does so well. A new shuffle block also appears in the game, which shuffles up the blocks in your well when it lands. Randomly creating squares this way saved me more than a few times.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4067/2124135-6758684777_3b2479d3a8_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2124135\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4067/2124135-6758684777_3b2479d3a8_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2124135\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4067/2124135-6758684777_3b2479d3a8_o.jpg\"></a></figure><p style=\"\">The default mode is the \"voyage,\" which takes you through the game's skins in a set order that includes tracks from artists like The Chemical Brothers, LCD Soundsystem, Benny Benassi, Kaskade, Aphex Twin, BT, and plenty more. This starts slow, and once you've gotten acclimated to the game, that can be a bit frustrating, because things might not get interesting from a difficulty perspective until you've played for 30 minutes or more. If you fail, you can quit to record your score and earned experience points (which unlock additional skins and avatars) or opt to continue from the current skin, which resets your score but gives just about anyone the chance to see every skin in the voyage, with a little persistence.</p><p style=\"\">For advanced players, there's a master mode, which starts out much harder but uses separate skins with a different soundtrack. Depending on your musical preference, this mode might not be as compelling for you as the main mode. Stopwatch, where you play the game with a set time limit, returns in Electronic Symphony, as does a playlist mode that lets you build a set of your favorite skins and play them. There's also a two-player duel mode that allows you to go up against a local friend. Perhaps it's a bit much to ask, given the rhythmic-nature of the game and the timing restrictions that might impose, but not having proper Internet play is still a bummer. The avatars get new, duel-specific abilities in this mode that let you screw around with your opponent in various ways.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Assuming you're connected to the Internet, every block you eliminate in every mode contributes to the destruction of the \"world block,\" a big spinning cube made of 2,000,000 cubes. This is a group goal for everyone playing the game around the world to shoot for, and the world block resets every 24 hours. I'm not sure what happens when the block is completely erased, but it's an intriguing enough idea to keep me playing every day until I get to find out.</p><p style=\"\">Lumines is a high-quality experience that just about earns its $40 price tag, even though it's a little hard to shake the notion that some of the previous installments appeared as downloadable games at downloadable prices.

This lovable little scamp's favorite thing is to possess people and make 'em explode.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The new downloadable stealth-action puzzler <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33123\" href=\"/warp/3030-33123/\" slug=\"warp\">Warp</a> starts with a great premise: You're a goofy little orange Martian whatsit trapped in an undersea research center, and your only hope of getting out is to teleport yourself through every obstacle that gets in your way. Considering everything about this facility's security system is built around <i>preventing</i> you from warping, that's not as easy as it sounds. Your ability to possess, displace, and disintegrate a wide range of objects and human beings gives the designers ample opportunity--which they mostly use wisely--to set up unique and mindbending puzzle scenarios, but clunky controls and some basic game flow issues undermine what's otherwise a pretty neat little game.</p><p style=\"\">At the outset, you can only warp yourself forward into space and inside specific objects, mainly people and various kinds of barrels. But over the course of the game you'll pick up other new powers, like projecting a spectral version of yourself through walls, swapping places with distant objects, and flinging whatever thing you're inside forcefully in a specific direction. There's also a diverse set of upgrades you can buy that give you advanced versions of those basic abilities. The upgrades give you some interesting new tactical possibilities when stealthily dealing with the patrolling guards--at which times Warp, with its overhead perspective, feels a bit like the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16140\" href=\"/metal-gear-solid/3030-16140/\" slug=\"metal-gear-solid\">Metal Gear Solid</a>--but they aren't required for the puzzle-solving. Many of those puzzles incorporate all the tools of the alien-research trade--laser barricades, conveyor belts, exploding barrels, and switches placed inconveniently on the other side of large gaps--to make you stop and think hard about how to use all the mechanics at your disposal to move on.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1732222-warp_pax_east_2011_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1732222\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1732222-warp_pax_east_2011_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1732222\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1732222-warp_pax_east_2011_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>If you aren't well upgraded, you aren't likely to get out of this situation.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Everything about Warp looks great on paper, but in practice I consistently found the act of playing it to be pretty frustrating. You can't move very fast by default, and there's a lag after every warp before you can move or warp again. It's understandable that your ability to warp is limited for balancing reasons, but by contrast, just about everything in the environment kills you instantly. Things like laser beams and explosions are one-hit kills, and if a guard spots you while you're out in the open, you're dead, period (and they'll sometimes shoot you from offscreen). The sluggish feel of your own movement and the ubiquitous lethality of the environment aren't a good mix, leading to a lot of deaths early on that you feel like you can't really avoid. If the game had load-free instant respawns a la <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25114\" href=\"/super-meat-boy/3030-25114/\" slug=\"super-meat-boy\">Super Meat Boy</a>, this really wouldn't be a problem. Instead you see a load screen every time you die, then you're returned to the last checkpoint you ran past in the game world, leaving you to repeat everything you did since you were there the last time. To be fair, the checkpoints are distributed liberally, but I was still discouraged from poking around in the environment much, since the constant risk of an unexpected death meant the tedium of reloading and playing back up to that part again.</p><p style=\"\">Given all this, it's freeing to purchase the upgrades that increase your movement and warp speed, and the game gets a good bit more satisfying and pleasant once you do, but that fact makes you wonder if those should have just been the default speeds to begin with. I recommend saving all your grubs (the game's upgrade currency) for those two bonuses before you go for any other abilities. There are some other clumsy aspects to the gameplay that don't improve with upgrades, though. The aiming control for flinging objects and delicately warping around in tight spots feels squirrely and imprecise at times; it's downright maddening when you're trying to warp through a grid of laser beams and end up frying yourself because the margin for error seems to be only a few pixels in size. I also ran into a couple of instances of object physics going awry and keeping me from solving puzzles properly. And while the rest of the game feels pretty well put-together, the last 30 minutes doubles down on all of the game's problems and makes for a pretty miserable final sequence. The ambitions of the game's core gameplay are good ones, so it's a shame that it falters a bit on the execution.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870726-warppax05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870726\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.58828125\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1870726-warppax05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1870726\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1870726-warppax05.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1870726-warppax05.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There's a sizable chunk of good puzzlin' in here if you can overlook some basic issues.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Warp isn't just a linear series of discrete puzzle rooms like, say, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21170\" href=\"/portal/3030-21170/\" slug=\"portal\">Portal</a>. Instead the undersea base is set up as a group of sprawling, interconnected facilities joined together by elevators, not at all unlike <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26706\" href=\"/shadow-complex/3030-26706/\" slug=\"shadow-complex\">Shadow Complex</a> or your favorite <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2440\" href=\"/metroidvania/3015-2440/\" slug=\"metroidvania\">Metroidvania</a>. And like those games, there are some areas you can't reach until later in the game when you've gotten the right powers. There are 66 upgrade-powering grubs scattered around the base, and there's also a smaller number of film canisters that are just there to be collectibles. You can get cheap upgrades to reveal the grubs and canisters on the map (and there are achievements attached to getting them all), so completionists will naturally be tempted to roam around and pick up all the items they missed. But I found the game to discourage backtracking, exploring, or really breaking from the critical path in any way. The maps of the different facilities don't line up when you flip between them, and the elevator icons don't indicate where you'll end up if you hop on them, so you don't have a good way of figuring out how to get where you want to go on different levels of the base.</p><p style=\"\">More damningly, some of the puzzles depend on items being in specific places, but when I decided to head back and explore the map later in the game and then tried to return to my objective, I found the state of the rooms I'd already completed hadn't been reset, meaning I initially had no way to get through them again. In those two specific cases I eventually figured out a way to skirt the edges of the game mechanics and return things to an arrangement where I could progress, but it just feels sloppy that you would run into cases like this in a game that ostensibly <i>wants</i> you to go back and forth at random times. There's only one kind of puzzle--where you have to swap places with objects on the other side of barriers--that I had this issue with, so it's entirely possible that if you were to head back and explore at other points in the game, you'd have no such problems. But that doesn't make it any less annoying if you do run into this sort of thing. Lastly, the game is practically begging for a new-game-plus sort of option, letting you go through again with all your upgrades and getting the items you missed. But there is none, with is all the more unfortunate given the existing issues with moving around in the game world.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Despite its mechanical foibles, Warp has a lot of charm in its visual design, animations, and infrequent dialogue, and if you can tolerate some frustration, there's a good quantity of unique puzzle-solving to be had.

Why he has imprisoned you is less important than how you'll go about escaping his clutches. At various points in the game, you'll control Lil and Laarg separately, or find yourself pushing them through levels as a team. In any event, you'll be controlling them solely via the touch screen.</p><p style=\"\">This is both Escape Plan's cleverest notion and its greatest source of distress. The touch-focused controls give it the vibe of an <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" slug=\"iphone\">iOS</a> game blown up perhaps a bit beyond what it can handle, though it also makes for a puzzle-solving experience that is unlike the bulk of the Vita's launch lineup. You move the twosome by swiping across the screen in the direction you want them to go. Of course, each stage is littered with pitfalls that could easily kill the easily violable pair, ranging from simple spike traps to elaborately designed mixes of electricity and smashing devices. As far as deadly prisons go, this one would rank highly in the guidebook.</p><p style=\"\">In order to navigate these pitfalls, you'll need to touch and swipe the screen in a variety of ways, sometimes in extremely rapid succession. If, for instance, you see a series of unextended platforms in front of you, using the rear touch pad to push each one out will provide a temporary bridge--emphasis on temporary. Many of Escape Plan's puzzles require crackerjack timing that can be a tad flustering, especially when you're forced to tap, pinch, and swipe both screens in rather intense combinations.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863319-19012escape_plangamescom201107b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863319\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.53984375\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1863319-19012escape_plangamescom201107b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1863319\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1863319-19012escape_plangamescom201107b.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Yup. I was right.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This is especially flustering when you're forced to mix screen-tilting into the equation as well. Lil has the ability to hook himself up to various air tanks and blow himself up into a balloon, which then lets him float around obstacles as you tilt the screen to-and-fro. The problem is that to get him down, you have to squeeze him to let air out. The precision of which direction you're squeezing him, and how hard is not quite what it ought to be. It's one of those mechanics that seems like a no-brainer on paper, but it's just not precise enough in execution to avoid frequent, accidental death.</p><p style=\"\">And therein lies the one fatal flaw of Escape Plan. It's not that the controls are bad or unresponsive, it's that it asks for a bit more precision than is really reasonable given the number of different things it often asks you to do. Trying to ensure you're touching the exact right part of the rear pad, while trying to squeeze and pinch the characters on the top touch screen, while maybe even keeping one finger on a hole in a pipe pumping out deadly smoke is a gameplay high wire act that I sincerely doubt too many players are going to be willing to endure.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The good news (or bad news, depending on how you look at it) is that Escape Plan doesn't last much beyond its welcome. It's a relatively short game that actually does a pretty good job of pacing out its more difficult bits with easier challenges sandwiched in between. There's a flow to the game that prevents you from getting too frustrated, and if you really, truly hate a puzzle, you actually have the option to skip over it to get to the next stage, should you just want to progress with the story.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1894466-escapeplan01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1894466\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.53828125\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1894466-escapeplan01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1894466\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1894466-escapeplan01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1894466-escapeplan01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Floating is not a great deal of fun.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The idea is that maybe, someday in the future, you'll want to come back to Escape Plan and try all those puzzles again. In this regard, Fun Bits has bought in wholesale to the iOS methodology of relying on players' desire for achieving ever-higher scores on repeat play-throughs in order to try and prop itself up as a $15 value. To be fair, there are some legitimately great puzzles in Escape Plan that I did decide to go back and play through a few times to try and up my ranking. Unfortunately, the one serious issue here is that the score factors in the number of gestures you use in a given stage, and it registers every minor tap or accidental swipe against the screen as a gesture. This means you essentially have to keep your fingers entirely off of either screen if you want to avoid accidental gesture-tallying, which, as you may imagine, is a tad ludicrous, given how most people grip handhelds.</p><p style=\"\">Still, while Escape Plan is a bit ramshackle in places, it's generally a fun enough game that is certainly a pleasure to look at. The game's black-and-white visual aesthetic is beautifully rendered, and the art style is just quirky enough to make its random spurts of gory cartoon violence seem completely reasonable in context. This is clearly a game that Fun Bits spent a lot of time crafting the look and feel of. It's just a shame they didn't spend a bit more time ironing out the mechanics.</p>", "deck": "Escape Plan never quite breaks out beyond its initial level of promise, but such as it is, it's a decent little puzzler for an OK price.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-470/", "platforms": null, "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36153/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/escape-plan/3030-36153/", "id": 36153, "name": "Escape Plan"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-02-17 16:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/syndicate-review/1900-471/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137161/2095806-syndicate_concept_art2_rgb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2095806\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56275720164609\" data-width=\"972\" style=\"width: 972px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/137161/2095806-syndicate_concept_art2_rgb.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2095806\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/137161/2095806-syndicate_concept_art2_rgb.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are plenty of office spaces and apartment buildings to shoot apart in the future.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10865\" href=\"/syndicate/3030-10865/\" slug=\"syndicate\">Syndicate</a> is a beautiful, brutal strategy game that gave you a team of futuristic super agents, the drugs you'd need to keep them under control, and a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6735\" href=\"/cyberpunk/3015-6735/\" slug=\"cyberpunk\">cyberpunk</a> setting that was just enough to let your imagination run wild. In 1993, back when we weren't busy trying to cram network connectivity into every single device we interact with, from cars to <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1685\" href=\"/refrigerator/3055-1685/\" slug=\"refrigerator\">refrigerators</a>, that was enough. The gameplay was stellar and the Gibson-style setting fit with our increasingly \"cyber\" times. Some of those basic ideas translate well into <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1768\" href=\"/starbreeze-studios-ab/3010-1768/\" slug=\"starbreeze-studios-ab\">Starbreeze</a>'s new <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30734\" href=\"/syndicate/3030-30734/\" slug=\"syndicate\">Syndicate</a>, which takes on the same \"megacorporations as the new government\" as the original Syndicate and so many other pieces of cyberspace fiction have in the past. The world view and ideas put forth in this Syndicate reboot are decidedly well-worn territory, but it's still a world worth exploring, mostly thanks to Starbreeze's continued gift for crafting first-person action games that don't feel like just another Shooter of the Day experience.</p><p style=\"\">It's 2069 and you're an \"agent\" for Eurocorp, one of the aforementioned megacorporations. Your name is <a data-ref-id=\"3005-20335\" href=\"/miles-kilo/3005-20335/\" slug=\"miles-kilo\">Miles Kilo</a>, which is either the greatest or worst name for a video game character of all time. But his name hardly matters because you'll spend much of the game as a largely faceless guy that has a prototype version of a chip in your head that lets you access the \"datascape,\" which is Syndicate's fancy term for \"the future Internet.\" This chip is what gives you your abilities, like a tactical overlay that lets you track any enemy you've spotted even when they're behind a wall by using an alternate vision mode. And testing out the capabilities of this new version of the chip is how the story gets started. From there, you delve into acts of industrial espionage, which in the future means preventing Eurocorp employees from defecting to other corporations and protecting company secrets by any means necessary while the unchipped proletariat sit in their slums, attempting to find a way to make all the corporations come crashing down.</p><p style=\"\">With the overlay from your DART chip enabled, you'll also slow down time and take less damage, making it absolutely necessary if you want to stay alive. You'll also have three abilities to use. Backfire overrides the chips found in most weapons and causes them to, well, backfire. This knocks down up to three enemies at once, opening them up for extra damage while they scramble to recover. The suicide ability causes your target to pull out a grenade (in the future, all enemies have grenades!) and detonate it, which is potentially useful for taking out large groups of tightly-clustered enemies, but I didn't run into too many of those outside of the training simulation where you're first learning how to use the ability. The final power is persuade, which is a clear nod to the Persuadertron found in the original game. Persuading a target in Syndicate flips his alignment for a period of time, causing him to target his allies and open fire. If he runs out of targets or time, he turns the gun on himself and blasts his own face off, which is a terrific and brutal touch. All three abilities recharge as you take down enemies with your firearms, which are your primary tools for interacting with the world of Syndicate.</p><p style=\"\">There are a lot of people to shoot in the Syndicate campaign, and more than enough guns to do it with. Most are fairly traditional takes on sub-machine guns, assault rifles, sniper rifles, and shotguns, but you'll run into a few other interesting tools, as well. The gauss gun--which was actually a rocket launcher in the original game--is an automatic rifle with a lock-on targeting system that lets you bend bullets around cover. You'll see that sort of lock-on a little later on in the game when you encounter a rocket launcher that can fire at multiple locked-on targets, too. But the game isn't really about flashy weaponry. It's more about making every weapon at your disposal feel great. Even the default pistol is fun to fire in Syndicate, largely because when you start to run, your agent holds the pistol out at a slight angle and, unlike the other weapons in the game, you can fire that pistol while you're still running, giving it that Hong Kong action cinema style that, even after all these years, still makes you feel like you're a bad dude.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2119113-syndicatedartv5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119113\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2119113-syndicatedartv5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119113\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2119113-syndicatedartv5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The DART chip in your skull lets you see through walls and highlight enemies.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The way the game handles its weapons is more than just a running animation, though. It has a fairly dynamic cover system that automatically reacts when you're ducked behind an object. Pushing up against cover causes you to raise the gun up and over cover for a believable-looking blind fire animation, and you can easily pop up for shots by hitting the aiming trigger. When you approach doors, walls, and other surfaces, the agent automatically moves the gun appropriately--lowering it when you're pressed up against a door, angling it around corners, and so on. Again, this isn't something that directly translates into gameplay, but all that weapon handling gives the game a great look and helps establish a more realistic tone... right up until you saw a cowering scientist in half with shots from an assault rifle, of course.</p><p style=\"\">Between the gunplay and the abilities, you're given a good number of options when it comes to dealing with a combat situation. Sometimes you'll encounter <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3350\" href=\"/unmanned-aerial-vehicle/3055-3350/\" slug=\"unmanned-aerial-vehicle\">UAVs</a> or armored enemies that must be \"breached\" with your hacking ability in order to make them vulnerable to weapon fire. So part of the game deals with closing the gap on those enemies to get within hacking range while finding a way to not get ripped into pieces by a heavy enemy's <a data-ref-id=\"3055-288\" href=\"/gatling-gun/3055-288/\" slug=\"gatling-gun\">minigun</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3055-45\" href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" slug=\"flamethrower\">flamethrower</a>. Dealing with high numbers of enemies, some of whom require special tactics, keeps you on your toes and forces you to use every ability at your disposal. The agents in Syndicate certainly aren't invincible--you'll go down quickly under sustained fire--but when you're comfortable with the mechanics and using everything properly, it all clicks in an extremely satisfying way. That feeling carries over to the multiplayer, which replaces your default campaign abilities with some more configurable options.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The multiplayer is a series of cooperative missions for up to four players. You can opt to play with fewer, but even a properly upgraded agent will have an extremely hard time taking on four enemy agents at once, and the difficulty doesn't appear to scale to fit the number of players. Prior to going into one of the game's nine scenarios, you can set up your loadout of weapons and choose two abilities to bring with you. As I seemed to be matched up with a lot of gung-ho lunatics that clearly didn't understand how to stay alive, I found the shielding ability, which gives your team a bit of armor when you pop it, to be pretty useful. Any teammate can heal and revive other players if they go down by breaching them the same way you'd breach a grenade to prevent it from going off or breach an enemy to drop his armor. But I also found the squad heal ability to be useful, since you need to have line-of-sight on a teammate in order to use the standard heal. Other abilities speed up your breaching, infect enemies with a health-lowering virus, and so on. If you're playing with a crew of people who know what they're doing, this means you can easily specialize in certain tasks and designate a healer, a breacher, and so on. But on the game's normal and hard difficulties, that doesn't seem to be required. More tactics and deadly accuracy seem like they'll be the things that allow players to complete the missions on the hardest difficulty setting, though.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2016862-syndicate_coop_final02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2016862\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2016862-syndicate_coop_final02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2016862\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2016862-syndicate_coop_final02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2016862-syndicate_coop_final02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are also plenty of uncharacteristically bright outdoor areas.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As you play online, you'll gain levels and earn upgrade points for your agent, your weapons, and your applications. The agent upgrades are similar to the single-player upgrades and they let you spend more time using your vision overlay, carry more ammo, regenerate health more quickly, and so on. Weapons and applications must be researched, so you'll spend tokens to, for example, allow the virus ability to spread from one enemy to another, and then you'll have to earn a set number of experience points with research on that item active before the upgrade is enabled. Red dot sights, secondary weapon abilities, improved damage, rate of fire, and so on all work the same way, but use weapon upgrade tokens, which come when you \"chip rip\" a heavy enemy after downing him during a mission. In a weekend of intense co-op play, I was able to unlock the vast majority of agent upgrades and most of the weapon and app upgrades that fit my play style.</p><p style=\"\">The cooperative mode attempts to follow a loose story about your up-and-coming corporation fending off challenges from other, more-established units, but it's really only told during the mission briefings. The single-player campaign doesn't really go too deep, either, but voice work from <a data-ref-id=\"3040-91177\" href=\"/rosario-dawson/3040-91177/\" slug=\"rosario-dawson\">Rosario Dawson</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89858\" href=\"/brian-cox/3040-89858/\" slug=\"brian-cox\">Brian Cox</a>, who's clearly doing what he does best by playing yet another slimy government/corporate dirtbag, keeps things moving just the same. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-76963\" href=\"/michael-wincott/3040-76963/\" slug=\"michael-wincott\">Michael Wincott</a> does a nice job with the role of your early-game partner, Jules Merit, who provides the requisite amount of gravelly voice that is now required by law in any game dealing with a dystopian cyberfuture. If you're interested in the backstory behind the world, you'll find plenty of additional items in the world that fill in a codex-like list of entries about various characters, locations, and syndicates. I found myself somewhat interested in reading things as I found them, but you won't miss anything vital if you skip it. All told, the campaign lasts around six hours and doesn't linger long enough to overstay its welcome, though a few of the boss fights provide difficulty spikes that some may find annoying. The cooperative campaign will probably take longer to complete, depending, of course, on the quality of your teammates.</p><p style=\"\">Syndicate looks and sounds great, for the most part. You'll find a crummy texture here and there on both <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">Xbox 360</a>, but it makes up for that with some terrific lighting and a good sense of style. The nice \"upzone\" areas where the sheep live have the pristine, futuristic look that you'd expect from a world run by corporations that want to keep the populace in line. Alternately, your trips downzone, where the unchipped live and are regularly identified by your HUD as simply \"hobo,\" look every bit like the forgotten slums they're built up to be. Also, despite what the pre-release promotion may have led you to believe, this game is <i>not</i> accompanied by an all-dubstep soundtrack. That Skrillex remix of the original game's theme song makes it in during a boss fight, but the rest is standard, moody video game music that fits the tone of the action just fine. Whether that's a good or a bad thing is, obviously, up to you.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2119110-syndicatedartv2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119110\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2119110-syndicatedartv2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119110\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2119110-syndicatedartv2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2119110-syndicatedartv2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The DART overlay gives you a nice, slowed-down look at moments like this.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I had an outstanding time with Syndicate and really took to the game's cooperative mode in a way that I really didn't expect. The teamwork required there is just enough to get you angry when someone's letting the side down, but not so much that you'll have to organize and coordinate every little move. Rushing into a room full of enemy corporate scum and mowing them all down as they scramble for cover makes you feel invincible due to your own skill at playing the game, rather than some sort of overpowering ability or story reason that puts you above all. The smart players will rise to the challenge and feel like they've been appropriately rewarded for their prowess. The campaign gives you a great look at an interesting world, though its abrupt, too-clean ending feels out of place. It's a somewhat disappointing reward for an otherwise exciting adventure that puts a terrific and fun spin on first-person shooting.</p>", "deck": "Syndicate gives you a great set of tools that make shooting at the world around you a lot of fun whether you're playing alone or with a team.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-471/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30734/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/syndicate/3030-30734/", "id": 30734, "name": "Syndicate"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-02-21 09:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-113332/", "id": 113332, "name": "Syndicate"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/touch-my-katamari-review/1900-472/", "description": "<p style=\"\">The franchising and subsequent beating into the ground of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-402\" href=\"/katamari-damacy/3025-402/\" slug=\"katamari-damacy\">Katamari Damacy</a> is sort of inexplicable, if you stop to think about it.

Year after year, we've gotten sequel after remake after compilation of new-ish levels, new-ish bonus stages, new-ish cutscenes, and new-ish craziness. It's all just variations on a singular theme. The art never really changes, the gameplay never really changes, and the characters never really change. In fact, short of the soundtrack and the layout of the usual objects to roll up, nothing really changes at all. It's like Namco is terrified that making even the slightest alterations to the formula will suddenly snap America awake to how completely ludicrous this thing they've been rebuying over and over again is, and the whole franchise will come to a deadly, screeching halt.</p><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-36424\" href=\"/touch-my-katamari/3030-36424/\" slug=\"touch-my-katamari\">Touch My Katamari</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-129\" href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" slug=\"playstation-vita\">PlayStation Vita</a> represents the biggest alteration to the Katamari formula in basically forever. It's the closest thing Namco has come to creating something significant within the already existing framework of what Katamari Damacy is. Within the scope of this series, it's practically earth-shattering. Are you ready for this? You might want to sit down...</p><p style=\"\">You can use the rear touch screen to scrunch and flatten your Katamari.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Look, it's not that this isn't a useful idea. In fact, it's minor brilliance. Now all those nooks and crannies you couldn't otherwise access because they were too narrow or too low are easily accessible by quick swipes of your fingers across the back touch screen. It's functional, responsive, and makes the act of playing Touch My Katamari just a bit more fun.</p><p style=\"\">Which is great, really, except for the part where you're doing it in levels that, while purportedly new, feel exactly like the same levels we've already played time and time and time and time and time again. Sure, some of the layouts are different, but the core conceit here is functionally unchanged. You'll start out in someone's house, rolling up tiny objects. You will grow bigger, rolling up larger stuff, then eventually people. Then houses. Then large pieces of landscape. Then skyscrapers. Then Godzillas. And so on and so forth.</p><p style=\"\">It's not that the Katamari formula needs drastic change to be fun, but it could use a few tweaks to the formula to combat the generalized feeling of d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu one gets while playing Touch My Katamari. It's extremely telling that the eight or so main levels, which supposedly are new, feel just like every other Katamari level in existence.

If so, then Touch My Katamari is by all means something worth your while. Thanks to the additional analog stick on the Vita, the game controls as well, if not slightly better than its console counterparts. The art style is the same as ever, but the game runs well, only losing framerate toward the end of the game where you're rolling up giant swaths of scenery. Those sections do get quite chunky, but that's nothing new for this series.</p><p style=\"\">Beyond the lack of newness, the only other major issue with Touch My Katamari is that there just isn't that much of it. With only a handful of levels and some leaderboards to play around with (along with a few of the usual dressing-up accouterments), you'll be done with Touch My Katamari in just a few hours. Sure, there are bonus items to hunt for in each stage, and those leaderboards are a fun enough way to show your friends how easily you've bested their biggest roll, but even if that doubles the amount of play time you'd get otherwise, that's still not very much content.</p><p style=\"\">Most disappointing is the game's conclusion, which lacks the kind of all-encompassing, universe devouring qualities of some of the series' best entries, switching instead to a sort of Rainbow Road-esque fantasy land that just tosses a bunch of random giant things from the other games together into a technicolor slurry. The supreme irony of that conclusion is that it ties up the game's storyline--which plays as something of a meta-commentary on the series as a whole, with the King of All Cosmos suddenly slovenly, lazy, and in need of inspiration--with an all-too-knowing comment about how the King (perhaps standing in for Namco itself) will work hard for the fans and never be lazy again. That it does this in a game that, quite frankly, feels only slightly less lazy than the last half-dozen or so entries in the franchise is maybe just a tad ironic. Hopefully, it isn't an indicator of what's to come for all things Katamari.</p>", "deck": "Touch My Katamari offers up one distinctly cool new idea for the series while more or less surrounding that idea with the same stuff we've already played to death.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-472/", "platforms": "PlayStation Vita", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36424/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/touch-my-katamari/3030-36424/", "id": 36424, "name": "Touch My Katamari"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-02-21 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114370/", "id": 114370, "name": "Touch My Katamari"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/rhythm-heaven-fever-review/1900-473/", "description": "<p style=\"\">One gets the impression that <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> has never been quite sure what to do with <a data-ref-id=\"3025-883\" href=\"/rhythm-tengoku/3025-883/\" slug=\"rhythm-tengoku\">Rhythm Heaven</a> (or Rhythm Tengoku, in Japan). Unlike their less-musical equivalent, the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-220\" href=\"/warioware/3025-220/\" slug=\"warioware\">WarioWare</a> series, these rhythmic minigame collections have no ubiquitous mascot character to help market the inherent weirdness within. Without that crutch, it becomes difficult to explain to all but the most Japanese-enthusiastic audience exactly what the hell is going on in any of these games. Bizarre music plays in time with even more bizarre visual scenarios, and the gameplay often revolves around just a couple of different commands over the course of the entire game. It's not a game of which the appeal can easily be summed up in a TV commercial--at least in this country.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1809472-rhythm_heaven_wii_1307525324_007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1809472\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.54807692307692\" data-width=\"832\" style=\"width: 832px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/86760/1809472-rhythm_heaven_wii_1307525324_007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1809472\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/86760/1809472-rhythm_heaven_wii_1307525324_007.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There is a reason why these monkeys are helping this golfer. That reason? MUSIC.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But that's what makes this franchise, and this latest entry, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35607\" href=\"/rhythm-heaven-fever/3030-35607/\" slug=\"rhythm-heaven-fever\">Rhythm Heaven Fever</a> for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" slug=\"wii\">Wii</a>, so fantastic. These games are so fundamentally bonkers that even if you've played the other entries in the franchise, you'll still feel like you're getting a fresh experience each time around. The minigames collected in Rhythm Heaven Fever may only revolve around a couple of variances on pressing the A and B buttons on the Wii Remote in time with the music, but somehow, be it through the transcendentally insane visual presentation that comes along with it, or the undeniably catchy rhythms inherent to the music, each game feels wholly unique, and almost always is a bunch of fun to play.</p><p style=\"\">There are a bit more than 50 new minigames in Rhythm Heaven Fever, each only lasting a minute or two, but with incentives to play them again and again. Trying to get into specific examples of what each game does would be pointless, as they all revolve around the same core theme: press the A, B, or A and B buttons in time to the musical cues played out on-screen.</p><p style=\"\">That sounds deceptively simple, but the rhythms employed in Rhythm Heaven Fever are often tricky, off-time, and full of stunts and pauses that are guaranteed to trip you up at various points. Yes, you're just pressing a pair of buttons in different combinations, but the timing requires precision, and a specific ear that can pick out the patterns within the musical composition. Each game is trickier than the last, of course, ensuring that by the time you get to the last few minigames, you'll either be an expert rhythm maker or hopelessly out of your depth.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Odds are greater on the former than the latter, as Rhythm Heaven Fever's progression is geared toward helping those hopelessly arrhythmic clods who couldn't keep a 4/4 beat if someone put a gun to their head. Four minigames are assigned to a specific set, or level, with a fifth game--a \"remix\" version of the four previous minigames combined into a single song--rounding out each tier. Should you find yourself hopelessly beaten down by one particular game or another, the developers were kind enough to provide you a skip option so that you might move on. The trick is that you'll have to fail several times before it pops up, meaning players who just want to skip from game to game because they're terrible at everything won't have that option until they've failed repeatedly and spectacularly.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2134821-ringside28.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2134821\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5685618729097\" data-width=\"598\" style=\"width: 598px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2134821-ringside28.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2134821\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2134821-ringside28.jpg\"></a><figcaption>If I had to pick a favorite among the many minigames, it's definitely this one. The song refuses to leave my brain.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Again, it would be pointless to try to run down the different minigame scenarios for you, because they all dart about in so many wild directions that it would essentially amount to me trying to describe each individual game specifically, since no two are exactly alike. They're similar in action, of course, but the scenarios include everything from musical pro-wrestling promo cuts, to one of the least \"gangsta\" rap video shoots since <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2AaQDK0tpt8\" rel=\"nofollow\">David Faustino made an album.</a> Some of these are so completely out-there that even Nintendo's localization team seems to have thrown its hands up in surrender at a few different points, opting to just have characters describe the action as, \"Hey! Let's do that thing we do! Yeah, that thing we do is great!\" I don't remember the specifics of that one, but I believe it involved sentient tuning forks hitting their heads against each other's asses to power a zeppelin.</p><p style=\"\">It's all done with a cute, if utterly strange cartoon art style that translates surprisingly well from the series' traditionally handheld roots. The music is also tremendously good, boasting some of the most inexplicably infectious songs of any game in the franchise. Stylistically, they run the gamut from goofy bossa nova to industrial-sounding pop music, though all of it sounds like it's been filtered through an old Casio keyboard--and I don't mean that insultingly. I've had at least a few of the songs stuck in my head on repeat for the last week, and based on conversations I've had with others who have played it that mostly consisted of them repeating the game's nonsense lyrics back at me, I'm not alone.</p><p style=\"\">It'd be nice if the tutorials for each game could be accessed separately from the main game, and that you didn't have to wait for the tutorial to load up so you can skip it each time you play. The unlockables and bonus bric-a-brac aren't especially great either. But those niggles aside, Rhythm Heaven Fever offers up no shortage of replayability purely on the merits of how much fun these games are. The two-player mode is a nice bonus as well, that will certainly keep those with friends and family around busy for a good bit. But even if you're strictly playing solo, Rhythm Heaven Fever is one of those games that begs to be replayed solely on the basis of its content, and how completely, peculiarly awesome it is. This is a great game at a great price for a console currently gasping gravely for games. If your Wii is still plugged into a TV-like device, Rhythm Heaven Fever is a game that demands your attention.</p>", "deck": "Rhythm Heaven Fever's catchy tunes and surprisingly varied two-button gameplay combine into an experience that's as wonderfully silly as it is frequently challenging.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-473/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35607/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/rhythm-heaven-fever/3030-35607/", "id": 35607, "name": "Rhythm Heaven Fever"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-02-22 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114838/", "id": 114838, "name": "Rhythm Heaven Fever"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/alan-wakes-american-nightmare-review/1900-474/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2123047-arcade3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123047\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2123047-arcade3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123047\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2123047-arcade3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>If you enjoy Alan Wake's combat, there's plenty of it for you here!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">When the credits rolled on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20982\" href=\"/alan-wake/3030-20982/\" slug=\"alan-wake\">Alan Wake</a>\u2019s surprisingly excellent add-on The Writer, my first thought was not \u201cmore combat, please.\u201d Combat in Alan Wake, a one-two punch of weakening enemies with a flashlight and pumping them full of lead, was fine but outstayed its welcome. More combat and a bit more story is exactly what <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1961\" href=\"/remedy-entertainment-ltd/3010-1961/\" slug=\"remedy-entertainment-ltd\">Remedy Entertainment</a> has delivered with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35157\" href=\"/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/3030-35157/\" slug=\"alan-wakes-american-nightmare\">Alan Wake\u2019s American Nightmare</a>, a downloadable expansion that, sadly, fumbles by stretching what little story it does have much too far.</p><p style=\"\">There is no longer a big world for Alan Wake to run around in. Instead, American Nightmare limits players to three big-ish environments: a motel, observatory, and drive-in theater. While <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1238\" href=\"/alan-wake/3005-1238/\" slug=\"alan-wake\">Alan</a> does \u201cdrive\u201d to each location, the player has no control over that part--it happens during loading screens. American Nightmare is a much more guided experience than Alan Wake, a result of the limited narrative scope.</p><p style=\"\">If you\u2019re interested in knowing what happened after Alan Wake, there are clues that paint a picture of recent events. This is not Alan Wake 2, however, and know that before going in. When the first location in American Nightmare wrapped up after about 30 minutes, it seemed my time in <a data-ref-id=\"3055-4692\" href=\"/night-springs/3055-4692/\" slug=\"night-springs\">Night Springs</a> would be awfully short, but then Remedy pulled a pretty clever narrative twist out of its hat. There is a reason for players to explore the game\u2019s environments three times to bring about the story's ultimate conclusion.</p><p style=\"\">On paper, it works. The narrative trick fits the weirdness of Alan Wake\u2019s world, and the first time it happens, it\u2019s actually pretty neat. The second time, it proved too much. Not enough substantively changes on subsequent trips to justify cycling through the three environments all over again. The game seems to acknowledge this issue by eventually spawning Alan much closer to objectives, preventing players from having to traverse the entire map all over again. You do spend less time in each location on follow-up visits, though, and some of the padding simply comes from whether or not you want to keep looking for TVs with FMV clips (do it) and manuscript pages. If you successfully journey through the night, however, you will be treated to several full-screen FMV sequences, nearly worth it on its own.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">In order to collect everything, you'll have to search high and low on each trip around the block, as some manuscript pages are only available during rounds two and three. Fortunately, finding the pages is much easier in American Nightmare, thanks to a near-obnoxious increase in each page's sparkly nature, and a question mark that briefly appears on the mini-map, suggesting you should investigate.</p><p style=\"\">It\u2019s all too bad, really, because American Nightmare's story is fun, goofy and self-referential. For once, characters will immediately start challenging Alan about the absurdity of his situation, and while most end up coming around to believing and working with him, convincing them leads to some great dialogue. The way Remedy completely leans into the <i>Night Springs</i> conceit from the original game (Alan Wake\u2019s version of <i>The Twilight Zone</i>) works wonderfully, complete with \u201cWritten by Alan Wake\u201d credit in the opening cut-scene. The Rod Serling imitation is pitch-perfect--different but not <i>too</i> different.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2123051-thegiant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123051\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2123051-thegiant.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2123051\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2123051-thegiant.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This big ol' guy will take plenty of bullets to finally take him down.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Combat itself hasn\u2019t changed very much in American Nightmare, except that you\u2019ll never worry about running out of ammunition again. There are plentiful ammo drops, and catch-all refill stations scattered about. I was one of those weirdos who enjoyed the survivalist aspect of Alan Wake, though, and trying to fix Alan Wake\u2019s combat issues by making ammo a non-issue is a poor solution. A couple of new creatures have been introduced to change things up. One enemy splits into weaker versions of itself several times over, another can transform into a flock of crows and will often surprise you from behind, and there\u2019s a gargantuan dude lumbering about with a mean chainsaw. For some reason, there are also tiny spiders everywhere.</p><p style=\"\">Once the mystery in American Nightmare is solved, what\u2019s left is Arcade Mode, Alan Wake\u2019s wave-based survival mode. Things play out exactly as you\u2019d expect, with Alan dropped into various nighttime settings and forced to fend off wave after wave of shadowy creatures until dawn arrives 10 minutes later. Alan Wake\u2019s flashlight combat has a pleasurable rhythm to it, but there\u2019s not enough nuance to sustain interest over more than a few 10-minute sessions. Collecting manuscript pages unlocks different tiers of weapons, which provides an incentive to hop back into the story mode again, but if you already played through the story, that\u2019s now four times venturing into the same three environments.</p><p style=\"\">Expecting an experience as ambitious as Alan Wake in a downloadable release may have been unrealistic, but Remedy set expectations unreasonably high with The Writer, which was utterly fantastic <i>and</i> ambitious. American Nightmare contains just enough story to justify a download for players invested in the fiction, but if you\u2019re new to Alan Wake, there are games with wave-based modes featuring superior combat, and buying a brand-new copy of Alan Wake wouldn\u2019t set your wallet back very much.</p>", "deck": "Alan Wake's downloadable debut features a neat story with a clever twist, but one that sadly outstays its welcome.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-474/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35157/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/alan-wakes-american-nightmare/3030-35157/", "id": 35157, "name": "Alan Wake's American Nightmare"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-02-22 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115113/", "id": 115113, "name": "Alan Wake's American Nightmare"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/grand-slam-tennis-2-review/1900-475/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32888/2005956-serena.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005956\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2000\" style=\"width: 2000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32888/2005956-serena.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005956\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32888/2005956-serena.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Grass, clay, and hard court surfaces impact play.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The name might lead you to believe otherwise, but it doesn\u2019t take much time with <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6255\" href=\"/ea-sports/3010-6255/\" slug=\"ea-sports\">EA Sports\u2019</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-36106\" href=\"/grand-slam-tennis-2/3030-36106/\" slug=\"grand-slam-tennis-2\">Grand Slam Tennis 2</a> to realize that this is a first-generation product, one that owes significantly more to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-62\" href=\"/sega/3010-62/\" slug=\"sega\">Sega\u2019s</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3025-208\" href=\"/virtua-tennis/3025-208/\" slug=\"virtua-tennis\">Virtua Tennis</a> than the original, <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" slug=\"wii\">Wii</a>-exclusive <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24396\" href=\"/grand-slam-tennis/3030-24396/\" slug=\"grand-slam-tennis\">Grand Slam Tennis</a> from a few years back. Sure, the evolution of the Virtua Tennis games has become, shall we say, <i>subtle</i>, over the past few years, yet Grand Slam Tennis 2 still can\u2019t quite break out of that decade-plus shadow. It\u2019s a decent start, but EA Sports still has some iterating to do before it\u2019ll have a genuine competitor.</p><p style=\"\">Though it trades the Japanese arcade gloss and crystalline guitars of Virtua Tennis in favor of EA Sports\u2019 bloodless house style, the most meaningful differentiator in Grand Slam Tennis 2 lies in the controls. By default, the game attempts to map all of your <i>racquet mechaniques</i> to the right stick, and you\u2019ll push the right stick down and up at various angles and with varying timing to serve and perform the flat, slice, top-spin, drop, and lob shots that make up your arsenal of moves.</p><p style=\"\">While the underlying intent of the right-stick controls that EA Sports is so damn fond of is to create a more tactile connection to the on-screen action, the irony here is that it ends up feeling more complicated and mechanical.

I wouldn\u2019t say I struggled with them, but my performance improved immensely once I switched to the familiar face-button controls. Don\u2019t chalk my preference entirely up to familiarity, though; it\u2019s simply easier to perform with the precision of timing and aiming afforded by button presses, rather than the comparatively long throws and vague sense of position offered by the right stick.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32888/2005953-murray.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005953\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2000\" style=\"width: 2000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/32888/2005953-murray.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2005953\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/32888/2005953-murray.jpg\"></a><figcaption>I can just hear Pat Cash and John McEnroe, saying the same thing, over and over...</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Digging into Grand Slam Tennis 2\u2019s nest of menus, it\u2019s hard to shake the sense that you\u2019re playing \u201cEA Sports Presents: A Sport,\u201d with options that are bland, predictable, and limited. You can play singles and doubles on real courts like <a data-ref-id=\"3035-77\" href=\"/wimbledon/3035-77/\" slug=\"wimbledon\">Wimbledon</a> or generic EA Sports-branded courts, you can set up tournaments, you can play online. The game is well-stocked with male and female pros, both current and classic, though there\u2019s not much personality beneath the likenesses. Even the character creator, which features EA Sports\u2019 patent-pending horrible monster generator better known as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6766\" href=\"/ea-game-face/3015-6766/\" slug=\"ea-game-face\">Game Face</a>, feels like it was cut whole-cloth out of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-276\" href=\"/tiger-woods/3025-276/\" slug=\"tiger-woods\">Tiger Woods</a> series.</p><p style=\"\">There are some interesting challenges in the game\u2019s Classics mode, which sticks you in a series of real and fantasy scenarios from the past 30 years of pro tennis. The career mode, though, represents the bulk of Grand Slam Tennis 2\u2019s bid at longevity, letting you take your custom tennis pro through a 10-year career. Though there\u2019s no visualized calendar, you can feel time tick by with each event, which invariably boils down to either a bland training exercise, a one-off exhibition match, a pre-tournament, or a proper, bracketed-and-branded tournament like the Australian Open, US Open, or Wimbledon. With little-to-no variety in the actual career action, monotony kicks in quick. Even when playing on an elevated difficulty level, I was consistently steamrolling the competition well into my second year.

A six-hour game composed primarily of cutscenes and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">Quick Time Events</a>, with some simplistic <a data-ref-id=\"3025-244\" href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" slug=\"god-of-war\">God of War</a>-style character action peppered here and there. Less frequently it turns into <a data-ref-id=\"3025-461\" href=\"/panzer-dragoon/3025-461/\" slug=\"panzer-dragoon\">Panzer Dragoon</a> for a few minutes at a time, but I am telling you for your own sake, right up top, that you will play through most of this game by pressing a single button or nudging an analog stick when instructed in order to keep the elaborately choreographed but otherwise hands-off action roiling across your screen. It feels like the kind of guilty pleasure that you and me, serious players of video games, should be embarrassed for enjoying. What satisfaction could there possibly be in a game that largely plays itself?</p><p style=\"\">In spite of the one big, obvious caveat, I kind of love this game. It's just so unashamed to be utterly ludicrous--actually, it's infectiously <i>excited</i> about being ludicrous--that you can't help getting swept up in the neon-colored, planet-spanning clashes between gods taking place in front of you. What the developers actually set out to make is not a traditional video game, but instead a mildly interactive season of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-159\" href=\"/dragon-ball-z/3025-159/\" slug=\"dragon-ball-z\">Dragon Ball Z</a> that's slightly more adult in aesthetic and tone...but only slightly.

But the woeful tale of demigod Asura and his betrayal at the hands of seven other deities is actually told with care, alternating deftly between moments of quiet pathos and high-flying kung fu fights in space. The former is largely there to justify the latter, as you spend the bulk of the game helping Asura expunge his rage into his onetime allies' faces with his divine robot fists, which he usually only has two of but which will occasionally multiply into six when the action calls for it. Things only get more ridiculous from there, and if you were impressed by the buzzed-about scene in the demo that pitted human-sized Asura against a world-destroying, planet-sized space Buddha, well, there's plenty more where that came from.</p><p style=\"\">That sequence seems kind of tame, now that I think about it, considering the sorts of unrestrained nonsense the game flings at you later on. Sheer craziness isn't enough; it's also about the way the craziness is presented. The visuals have a tremendous scale, and the action is masterfully framed by someone who really knows how to work a camera angle. And it all takes place against a backdrop of marauding demons and divine plans to cleanse the world in fire planet-sized tentacle monsters and trillions of souls coalescing into metaphysical superweapons and...well, it's the sort of quasi-mythological futuristic nonsense that's exclusively the domain of anime and JRPGs. I'm generally so fatigued by that stuff these days that I rarely want to go near it, but this game lays it all out there so willingly and is just so darn enthusiastic about it all that I eventually threw myself in there and gleefully went along for the ride. It's a hell of a ride, and it tweaks your brain's pleasure center for flashing lights and clashing fists so hard that I was surprised how much I also cared about what was going to happen to specific characters by the end of it. It's almost as if the story beats give weight and meaning to the action. Imagine that!</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90134/1757739-asura_s_wrath_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757739\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90134/1757739-asura_s_wrath_6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757739\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90134/1757739-asura_s_wrath_6.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90134/1757739-asura_s_wrath_6.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>RAAAAAAAAAAAAGE.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Asura's Wrath is an incredible thing to watch, but in thinking about whether to recommend this game, I can't help coming back to how you play it. There's just not much to it. The Quick Time Events should be self-explanatory, and the melee combat is also largely devoid of technique. You've got a light combo attack and a heavy move with a cooldown, a jump kick and a charge punch. Even bosses lack health bars; the goal of every combat encounter is to fill up your \"burst\" meter by attacking stuff, and when it's full, you pull the right trigger to explode out another QTE that will move you along to the next part of the story. (Yelling \"Burst!\" every time you do this is optional but highly encouraged.) The fighting is really just something you button-mash your way through between big action sequences, with the exception of a couple of annoyingly tricky bosses who do a ton of damage and can knock you out of your attacks and generally just obliterate you. In those cases it's best to hang back and dodge until they launch into a canned animation that you can parry with a button prompt, which is the best way to fill up your burst quickly. See, they can't even keep the Quick Time stuff out of the parts where you're almost playing an actual video game.</p><p style=\"\">For story-related reasons, the game at least does a good job of mixing up the rare moments of gameplay by leaning more heavily on shooting in the last third, where you'll be taking down multiple targets with the sort of lock-on shooting for which Panzer Dragoon has become the obvious shorthand. While I'm getting all referential, there's more than a tinge of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-344\" href=\"/space-harrier/3025-344/\" slug=\"space-harrier\">Space Harrier</a> in those late-game shooting sequences as well, when you start running or flying forward at a zillion miles an hour through spaceship corridors and galactic fleets, dodging obstacles and shooting down bad robots. The game actually scores you on your combat performance, button-prompt accuracy, and time, doling out a ranking after each episode (culminating in the coveted S) that feeds into some unlocks and achievements, so there's an incentive beyond seeing the story to try and do well at this stuff, and even to go back to it multiple times if you truly need to get everything.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90134/1757737-asura_s_wrath_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757737\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90134/1757737-asura_s_wrath_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1757737\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90134/1757737-asura_s_wrath_4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90134/1757737-asura_s_wrath_4.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Seriously, y'all.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Simple as the game may be, I just couldn't bother to feel underwhelmed by what I was <i>doing</i> when contrasted with the sheer enormity of what I was <i>watching</i>. This game could have just as easily been an actual animated series or movie with little lost in the translation, but I'll admit to a Pavlovian sort of satisfaction at the repetitive action of hitting a button every few seconds and being rewarded with another exceptional action scene. Whether that's enough to qualify Asura's Wrath as a truly interactive experience isn't for me to decide, but somehow the whole thing comes together and works a heck of a lot better than it seems like it should. The pervasive anime trappings help bind the package together, all the way down to little \"next time on\" teasers that play after each episode, and customizable commercial bumpers the game cuts to at dramatic moments. The English voiceover is perfectly serviceable, and in fact the actors clearly had a lot of fun with the amount of yelling they got to do. But the inclusion of the Japanese voiceover is much appreciated since the acting there has such a throaty, dramatic weight, as it does in almost all anime. The designers even know how to work the UI for maximum impact, dropping an extra title card at a dramatic moment here and there, or doing some creative things with the placement of the button prompts to correspond to the action. The expert presentation and production values really help make up for the low degree of interactivity.</p><p style=\"\">Even still, Asura's Wrath is such a strange game to describe, much less to try to recommend, or not. I don't think it's the best value at the full $60 price, and if the idea of mostly hitting buttons when prompted for six hours sounds like a drag to you, it won't be a good value for you no matter how cheap it gets. At the same time, it feels like Japan embracing what Japan does best, tying together strong art design, passionate storytelling, and a decades-long tradition of high-flying action starring larger-than-life mythical figures. It's an anime with pixel shaders instead of ink, bringing to bear all the strengths of that medium but with just enough game-like hooks to justify its place on a console. Do I think all games should head in this direction? Certainly not. But am I glad this one is the way it is?

It's a strange mixture of vibes that, at times, seem at odds with one another. It's as though the team behind SSX were never quite sure how far toward realistic danger nor straight-up arcade ludicrousness it ought to veer toward, relying on the old school silliness of SSX's snowboarding gameplay to carry the load as the team built a gaggle of new mechanics and concepts around it--some of which don't really gel with that classic SSX flavor.

Albeit with a few extra quirks that make it messier than usual.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">First and foremost, the thing to understand about this SSX is that it controls <i>correctly.</i> The game presents you with a couple of different control options, including a classic style that maps the various tricks you can pull off to the face buttons of the controller, or, in a move that speaks to the great \"analog sticking of everything\" that video games have been all but obsessed with over the last several years, you can instead opt to swipe the right analog stick in various directions, should that suit your fancy. For my part, I stuck to the buttons, as I felt the timing and responsiveness of the rider on screen better suited my play style that way. The right stick always felt a bit too willy-nilly for my tastes, though perhaps others may see it differently.</p><p style=\"\">Regardless of which style works for you, the greater point is that on the slopes, the action feels fantastic. SSX has always been about speed and the outright obliteration of the laws of physics, and this SSX takes that mantra to absurd new heights. I feel I am in no way speaking out of turn when I say that this SSX is light years faster and more intense than any of the games of yore. Go ahead, pop that copy of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17149\" href=\"/ssx-3/3030-17149/\" slug=\"ssx-3\">SSX 3</a> back into your <a data-ref-id=\"3045-19\" href=\"/playstation-2/3045-19/\" slug=\"playstation-2\">PlayStation 2</a>, and then give this one a spin. Chances are, the old game will make you feel like you just graduated from an Edsel to a Trans Am.</p><p style=\"\">The bonus is that it does this while maintaining a sharp visual style and an even sharper frame rate. The game simply doesn't slow down on either the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">Xbox 360</a> nor the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a>, save for very, very minor bouts during some of the hairier races. It's nothing that's going to affect your play, however, though at times, you might actually pray for a bit of slowdown, just so you can regain your bearings.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">You see, the one quirk with all that speed is that it can often lead to absolute chaos on the slopes. Of course that chaos comes part and parcel with being something called SSX, but in this version it's almost incomprehensible at times. Smart players will learn quickly that the speed boost is something to be used sparingly in key situations, and not something to be spammed constantly. That might seem at odds with the notion of winning, but it's not at odds with the idea of you <i>surviving</i>.</p><p style=\"\">SSX is no longer just about getting through the courses in the fastest time or with the highest trick score--it's about making it out with your spine still intact. Large precipices and huge, jutting rock formations litter many of the courses, meaning you may very well kill yourself at some point during a race. And by may, I mean <i>you will</i>.</p><p style=\"\">SSX certainly has its moments of frustration. There are certain courses that seem to have been designed with the maximum potential for controller-throwing rage in mind. This becomes especially true during the game's \"deadly descents,\" courses that are purely about survival above all else. These courses are, of course, extremely tricky, and often involve quite a bit of accidental death. You'll have a bit of that on the less-deadly descents too, but the ones stamped as deadly practically require rote memorization of the course to survive, especially in the later stages of the game.</p><p style=\"\">In order to try and keep you alive, EA added a number of equipment types for players to strap on before some of the tougher scenarios. Courses with huge gaps between boardable sections require wingsuits that can be deployed by a tap of the right bumper/R1 button. Icy courses demand ice picks that can be used to help you make sharp turns. Blizzard condition courses give you a pulse lamp that helps identify the terrain during a whiteout, and so on and so forth.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1865336-ssxsurvive1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1865336\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1865336-ssxsurvive1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1865336\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1865336-ssxsurvive1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The life-saving equipment added to the SSX formula doesn't always have the intended effect.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">They're interesting ideas that sometimes feel like stopgap solutions instead of full-fledged mechanics. For instance, the control inherent to the wingsuit gives one the impression that no one spent much time actually using the thing during QA. It sometimes seemed to just undeploy itself at random, and sometimes just wouldn't travel in the direction I was steering my character toward. The headlamp mechanic is borderline useless, since your field of vision is entirely dependent on the position of your head, and doing tricks often leads to disorienting situations where you have no sense of where you're actually supposed to be.</p><p style=\"\">And then there is the rewind mechanic, that great bastion of all things racing in video games of the last several years, the thing that makes it so that no matter how bad you suck, you can just wipe away all your failure at the press of a button. Except that isn't really the case here. In SSX, rewinding is less of a catch-all failure eraser, and more of a stiff punishment for sucking that begrudgingly allows you to carry on. When you rewind, you're fined a stiff points penalty for every millisecond of time you go backward. And to add insult to your time-reversed injury, other players on the course don't experience the same rewind. So while you're flying backward out of a ravine and back onto semi-solid ground, everyone else is just on about their business. It's an interesting idea that, in certain scenarios, renders rewinding all but useless. On the deadly descents, where point totals and times come second banana to just surviving the damn thing (primarily during the World Tour mode), they're a godsend. In any situation where you're racing other players, you might as well just hit the restart button instead.</p><p style=\"\">The aforementioned issues only stand out so much because they're the bulk of what makes this experience new. It's as if at some point, an EA executive sat down the team, who had been making a perfectly good SSX sequel in the vein of its predecessors, and said something to the effect of, \"Look, guys, it's great that you've captured what people loved about the old games. But we really need something new, something hip, something fresh to sell this to a modern audience.\" Hence, all the rewinding and upgradeable equipment and dubstep.</p><p style=\"\">While those changes never feel organically blended into the framework of what we've come to know SSX as, they can be reasoned with. There's a learning curve, certainly, but there is a time when you will at the very least learn to grudgingly accept them, and manage to work with them. And honestly, I don't want to belabor these points too heavily, because in the end, they're the minority of SSX's overall experience. By and large, the majority of SSX's courses are great. They're fast, fun, full of crazy grindable/jumpable scenery, and for all intents and purposes, feel exactly how you would like SSX courses in 2012 to feel. There are lots of them too, spread across many exotic locales like <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1933\" href=\"/antarctica/3035-1933/\" slug=\"antarctica\">Antarctica</a>, the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3474\" href=\"/himalayas/3035-3474/\" slug=\"himalayas\">Himalayas</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-3893\" href=\"/siberia/3035-3893/\" slug=\"siberia\">Siberia</a>.

To be clear, that's multiplayer largely in the asynchronous sense. SSX takes most of its multiplayer cues from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31698\" href=\"/need-for-speed-hot-pursuit/3030-31698/\" slug=\"need-for-speed-hot-pursuit\">Need for Speed: Hot Pursuit's</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3015-7018\" href=\"/autolog/3015-7018/\" slug=\"autolog\">Autolog</a>, the all-encompassing rivalry system that constantly updates you on how your friends are performing on various courses, all while goading you into trying to beat them. And want to beat them you will.</p><p style=\"\">You'll do most of this competing in both the Explore and Global Events sections, as the World Tour mode is little more than a barren and frustrating single player mode that's more tutorial than campaign. Explore features 150 different variations on the different mountain courses (many of which do overlap), while Global Events focus on specialized events that the entire player base of SSX can simultaneously compete in. Those who perform well on the Global Events will earn a proportionate amount of credits (which you use to buy equipment, outfits, and the like) to the quality of the performance. You can also create your own Global Events and make them decidedly less global, if you just want to play with your friends.</p><p style=\"\">It's these ideas that give SSX its legs, and makes it worth trudging through the initial awkwardness of its other various experiments in how to make SSX appealing to kids these days. It's the \"everything to everyone\" approach that sometimes threatens to derail this new SSX, but it's the solidity of the core design\u2014the same design that's propelled this series for the better part of the last decade\u2014that makes it absolutely worthwhile.</p>", "deck": "SSX is an intriguing mix of old and new that doesn't always pan out, but the absurdist snowboarding gameplay remains as thrilling as ever.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-477/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33393/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ssx/3030-33393/", "id": 33393, "name": "SSX"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-02-28 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-109622/", "id": 109622, "name": "SSX"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mass-effect-3-review/1900-478/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2141069-at02_042.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141069\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2141069-at02_042.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141069\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2141069-at02_042.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Citadel must be huge, because this game's got a handful of new areas to explore.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-29935\" href=\"/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/\" slug=\"mass-effect-3\">Mass Effect 3</a> faces expectations that are almost impossibly high, partially due to the high quality of its predecessors and the richness of its fiction. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-98\" href=\"/bioware/3010-98/\" slug=\"bioware\">BioWare</a> managed to create a sci-fi world worth obsessing over. Expectations are also off-the-charts because of the nature of Mass Effect's story. By adjusting itself to the choices you've made across the previous games, players have become attached to their version of the story, to their <a data-ref-id=\"3005-658\" href=\"/commander-shepard/3005-658/\" slug=\"commander-shepard\">Commander Shepard</a>. It's unreasonable to expect it to exceed every possible aspect of its predecessors, and I've tried to keep my own personal expectations in check. Mass Effect 3 certainly isn't a bad game, and ultimately I'd recommend that anyone with an importable Shepard from Mass Effect 2 should check it out. But even after making a real attempt to be pragmatic about Mass Effect 3, I've come away from it feeling a little disappointed about the way this trilogy closes out.</p><p style=\"\">No one wanted to believe him/her, but it's all true.

After a brief sequence on Earth that largely serves as a tutorial about how to shoot and use abilities, Shepard is back on the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3368\" href=\"/normandy-sr-2/3055-3368/\" slug=\"normandy-sr-2\">Normandy</a> and back in command with orders to go get help from the other civilizations around the galaxy. Much like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21590\" href=\"/mass-effect-2/3030-21590/\" slug=\"mass-effect-2\">Mass Effect 2</a> was all about assembling a loyal crew for a final \"suicide mission,\" Mass Effect 3 is about traveling the galaxy and solving problems in order to make entire races and planets loyal to your cause to ensure they'll be present for a final conflict with the Reapers.</p><p style=\"\">The tasks you'll face, some optional and some mandatory, get funneled into your fleet strength, and the choices you'll make along the way also impact this number in ways both big and small. So if you allow a reporter to embed herself on your ship and grant her occasional interviews, you'll be able to rally (or discourage) specific factions in your fleet, which can raise or lower your number a little bit. Other choices, such as how you address the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-579\" href=\"/krogan/3015-579/\" slug=\"krogan\">Krogans</a>' ongoing fertility problem, make a larger impact and potentially come at a price, as one faction might not like it if you side with another. As in Mass Effect 2, you can proceed past the story's point of no return with less than a full complement of allies, but this will have storyline consequences. Filling the \"you must have this many allies to proceed\" bar, though, isn't especially challenging, assuming you're willing to scan some planets and embark on some optional missions along the way.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80045/2140335-masseffect3demo_2012_02_29_01_02_52_16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2140335\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80045/2140335-masseffect3demo_2012_02_29_01_02_52_16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2140335\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80045/2140335-masseffect3demo_2012_02_29_01_02_52_16.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The attachment system lets you slap some quick bonuses on a weapon.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Along with building your alliances, scientists will also be constructing something that they <i>think</i> can stop the Reapers. But those old space racists at <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3233\" href=\"/cerberus/3015-3233/\" slug=\"cerberus\">Cerberus</a> have their own ideas about how best to proceed. So along with ending centuries-old conflicts via 30 minutes of third-person shooting and a few choices on a dialogue wheel, you'll also fight your way through human enemies, along with Reaper husks or others, depending on the scenario. Much of the side content in Mass Effect 3 is combat-focused, to the point where the game's multiplayer levels appear as \"N7 missions\" in the campaign, and most of these have you running around a relatively small area, hitting buttons and fending off waves of enemies. Sometimes a mission will simply stop and give you the objective of \"survive,\" which feels like an artificial way to pad some of these missions out. It's not that the combat in Mass Effect 3 is bad--it's cleaned up and feels a bit tighter than ME2's did--but it's still not substantial enough to serve as the centerpiece of the game.</p><p style=\"\">For me, the centerpiece of a Mass Effect game is the story and the characters. Along these lines, Mass Effect 3 can feel like a reunion, if enough of the ME2 cast is still alive in your version of the story. It's easy to see where the existing characters can either plug right into the action or be replaced with generic counterparts, if necessary. Heading out to meet up with Krogans? Hey, Grunt's there! Encountering the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-825\" href=\"/quarian/3015-825/\" slug=\"quarian\">Quarians</a>? You'd better believe that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2372\" href=\"/talizorah-nar-rayya/3005-2372/\" slug=\"talizorah-nar-rayya\">Tali</a>'s showing up. And yes, you'll face the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1394\" href=\"/geth/3015-1394/\" slug=\"geth\">Geth</a>, and... yeah, it's not hard to guess about who you'll run into along the way. In a game where the full crew of ME2 survived, the story of Mass Effect 3 feels like one big coincidence after another because you're constantly and conveniently bumping into prominent cast members. Yet most of these old crew mates won't be returning to the Normandy this time around, because most of them have other responsibilities. Some of them will, however, appear on the ground while you're performing missions, but they'll be heading up a second squad or off performing their own tasks while you fight, relegating them to little more than radio chatter. Even with that in mind, as someone desperate to see how this story was going to conclude, it's great to see this cast of characters coming together again. And though it leaves a hint of an opening for some further adventures in this universe via a really hokey post-credits sequence, the actual endings provide a decent bit of closure for your Shepard story, even if the final speech that tries to tell you what you're choosing between is a little convoluted.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">There aren't too many new faces in your crew. The most prominent is Alliance soldier <a data-ref-id=\"3005-18477\" href=\"/james-vega/3005-18477/\" slug=\"james-vega\">James Vega</a>, a thick-necked human with a no-nonsense attitude and an affinity for making up nicknames for the other members of your crew. Personally, I liked the idea of having a guy around who wanted to call me \"Loco,\" so James found his way into my three-man crew more often than not. He starts out slowly, but his character develops in an interesting way over the course of the game. Considering that most of the people you encounter are already extremely well-established in the fiction, it's nice to have a couple of new characters to uncover along the way.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2141075-op09_003__alt_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141075\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2141075-op09_003__alt_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141075\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2141075-op09_003__alt_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2141075-op09_003__alt_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Familiar faces--or visors, at least--have been stuffed into every corner of the game, assuming said faces are still alive in your version of the story.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's great that the game takes so many of your previous choices into account, and it can feel like magic when that works out in a memorable way. Some of the interactions feel a little light, but it's generally pretty cool. Love interests, which have been a part of the previous games, often come off a bit strange, though. Since the game's built to handle a wide variety of potential outcomes and partners, it occasionally flip-flops between heartfelt dialogue that makes sense when talking to someone that you've gotten with in the past to terse, \"just friends\" sort of lines. Perhaps it's a bit much to ask the developers to record each line multiple times to account for the different subtexts that can be hidden behind the script, but it sticks out just the same.</p><p style=\"\">If you aren't interested in performing the optional tasks required to fill up the \"Effective Military Strength\" bar and get the game's best (or, at least, most prepared) ending, you can fill it up halfway and then raise your readiness rating via the game's multiplayer. By default, the rating starts at 50 percent, so for every bit of help you're getting by completing tasks, you're only getting half of its true value. Again, it's pretty trivial to get twice the amount you need and fill the bar completely before embarking on the game's final missions, so the multiplayer isn't a vital component to the campaign. But it still has some interesting ideas that <i>almost</i> make me wish it played a heavier role.</p><p style=\"\">The multiplayer side of the game allows four players to join together and go through 10 waves of enemies. It's Mass Effect's take on the standard <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\" href=\"/horde/3015-3021/\" slug=\"horde\">wave-based survival mode</a> format, with ammo dumps spread around the map to let you reload and the ability to raise a fallen comrade if you reach them quickly enough. It also slides in some objectives along the way, forcing you to activate four consoles, or take down four marked targets, and so on. These objectives are timed and they aren't optional. If you can't complete the task before time expires, you fail completely. And failure, either from a missed objective or losing all of your teammates, sends you back to the menu. There's no second chance at a wave, you'll need to start again. In my experience, most runs at the middle difficulty were taking around 30 minutes to complete, and the bonus you get for completing the task and getting everyone out alive is sizable.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2117964-mass_effect_3_2012_01_31_12_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2117964\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/2117964-mass_effect_3_2012_01_31_12_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2117964\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2117964-mass_effect_3_2012_01_31_12_006.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/2117964-mass_effect_3_2012_01_31_12_006.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>He might look like a basic meathead, but Vega's A-OK.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Along the way, you'll earn credits and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-39\" href=\"/experience-points/3015-39/\" slug=\"experience-points\">experience points</a>. XP is broken up by class, and each class has a few races associated with it that all level up together. So if you play a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4350\" href=\"/drell/3015-4350/\" slug=\"drell\">drell</a> adept, the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1582\" href=\"/asari/3015-1582/\" slug=\"asari\">asari</a> adept also levels up along the way. The racial differences come in the form of preset power assignments. So that drell adept has reave, pull, and cluster grenades. And the asari has stasis, warp, and throw. You can swap characters out easily before going into a match, so these race/class combos sort of feel like preset loadouts from a first-person shooter. You can, however, choose any two weapons, and the attachment system comes into play, allowing you to slap items onto your guns that increase accuracy, damage, shots per magazine, and so on. This same system appears in the single-player, but acquiring weapons and attachments takes a bit more work in the multiplayer.</p><p style=\"\">As you level up, you'll earn points to spend on your powers, just like in the campaign. But credits can be spent on random item packs. There are three different qualities to choose from, and the more expensive packs guarantee items of a higher rarity. Some of these items are single-use bonuses that you can trigger via the D-pad during combat, like an item that instantly restores your health and shields, an ammo replenisher, or medigel that can be used to resurrect yourself in case a teammate won't make it over to you. But you'll also find better weapons, attachments, and even new character/class combinations along the way. I came out of most multiplayer matches with 15-20,000 credits, which is enough for three or four base-level packs or one of the middle-grade packs. The randomized nature of it all can be maddening if you're trying to get a specific upgrade, and some sort of user-level item trading system might have been nice. But there's a bit of a thrill that comes when you're spending these hard-earned credits and waiting to see what pops out. If you're the impatient type, you can also toss real dollars at it and buy mid-level packs for a buck or high-level packs for two. I got curious and threw about $10 at it to see what sort of things popped out in the rare packs and wasn't too thrilled with what I got. That's the luck of the draw, I suppose.</p><p style=\"\">Even though it has some interesting ideas, it's hard to get excited about yet another take on wave-based survival, especially one that uses the occasionally-clumsy Mass Effect combat as its base. Once you start thinking about how most of the campaign's side content either uses these same multiplayer levels or has you performing extremely basic retrieval tasks, it's easy to start feeling slightly indignant about the whole thing.</p><p style=\"\">But only <i>slightly</i>. At the end of the day, Mass Effect 3 is a game for people who liked Mass Effect 2 so much that they absolutely <i>need</i> to see how it all ends. Despite claims to the contrary from the game's publisher, I really don't think newcomers will get much out of it at all. All it would take is getting to the new character creation screen and being forced to select between Numerous, Ashley, or Kaiden from a screen that asks you who died during your previous missions for a new player to realize they're being asked questions they couldn't possibly answer in an educated way. The value in this story is from seeing characters you adore dealing with a continuing situation. Even though it doesn't come together quite as successfully as it did in the previous games, those of you with an attachment to the Mass Effect universe should still play it.</p>", "deck": "It's not the best game in the trilogy, but I'd still take a decent Mass Effect game over most story-driven releases.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-478/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29935/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mass-effect-3/3030-29935/", "id": 29935, "name": "Mass Effect 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-03-06 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101890/", "id": 101890, "name": "Mass Effect 3"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/journey-review/1900-479/", "description": "<p style=\"\">When we talk about beauty in video games, more often than not we\u2019re discussing it purely in the aesthetic sense.

This is more often the case than not simply because when we think of video games, we aren\u2019t often able to point to more than a handful of experiences that truly affected us beyond the surface level emotions inherent to gaming: namely those of basic joy, humor, and all too often, frustration.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1800957-character_desert_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800957\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1800957-character_desert_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800957\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1800957-character_desert_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Who are you?

But where it truly shines is in the experience of playing it. In Journey, the mere acts of jumping, running, and sliding around a painstakingly crafted world are enough to invoke strong emotional responses from the player. Every element, every mechanic, every single little thing works in seemingly effortless concert to deliver a game that is experientially beautiful from surface to core.</p><p style=\"\">Maybe that won\u2019t be an altogether surprising thing to learn for those who have previously delved into the worlds imagined by thatgamecompany and its creative lead, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-82903\" href=\"/jenova-chen/3040-82903/\" slug=\"jenova-chen\">Jenova Chen</a>. In games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15849\" href=\"/flow/3030-15849/\" slug=\"flow\">flOw</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21120\" href=\"/flower/3030-21120/\" slug=\"flower\">flower</a>, Chen and crew have previously shown us gameplay concepts that blend traditional game mechanics with headier, less immediately tangible ideas of what a game environment can be. In that regard, Journey feels very much like a culmination of the studio\u2019s previous work. It feels like the end result of many lessons learned, trials overcome, and ideas fully explored. It is confident in its design, and unwavering in its ambiguity. It is, quite simply, a masterpiece.</p><p style=\"\">In Journey, you play as a nameless, nearly faceless creature of indeterminate origin. You\u2019re decked in a robe that could be perceived as religious garb (or could just as easily just be a nicely decorated robe.) There is no real preamble to explain your character, where they came from, or why they find themselves standing in the middle of a vast, lonely desert. Nor do you get a particular explanation for why you are compelled to venture toward a distant mountain, with a peak that glows in a way that practically beckons you forward. All these details are left to the player\u2019s imagination, perception, and interpretation.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">All you do know is that you want to move forward, through that desert and toward that mountain. Initially, all you can do is walk. Soon, you\u2019ll discover a cluster of reddish fabrics that look similar to the scarf that\u2019s draped around your character\u2019s neck. These fabrics turn out to be the fuel for your sole major ability in Journey. They give your character the power to leap and float through the air for limited periods of time. There is a sentient quality to these little swaths of cloth, especially later on as...well, I won\u2019t spoil it for you.</p><p style=\"\">That\u2019s the tricky thing about trying to describe a game like Journey to someone. So much of its wondrous appeal comes from simply not knowing what to expect. Going in with less specific details is ideal, as knowing how your journey evolves over time before you\u2019ve even taken it would rob that first time through of much of its awe-inspiring beauty. It is enough to simply say that the world around you evolves into more than just a desert. The terrain grows, both in scope and treacherousness as time goes on. Each \u201clevel\u201d of Journey is comparatively unique, offering up something the player hasn\u2019t yet seen before. Taking in that ever-evolving world without too much foreknowledge is not merely recommended; it\u2019s necessary.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1800963-screenshot0030.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800963\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1800963-screenshot0030.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1800963\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1800963-screenshot0030.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You have no direct say in Journey's multiplayer element, and trust me when I say that's for the best.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">And yet, once you have finished it, the desire to go back and play again and again is there. Is the experience lessened by having already done it once before? Absolutely not. If anything, it\u2019s heightened by the awareness of what\u2019s to come, and the anticipation of seeing it all over again. The first time through, it\u2019s crucial to be unsullied by too much information, but for subsequent plays, it won\u2019t even matter.</p><p style=\"\">It\u2019s not that Journey varies itself up, or really changes at all from play to play. And yet there is one key difference, one unpredictable factor that never comes up the same way twice: multiplayer.</p><p style=\"\">Yes, Journey has cooperative multiplayer, but not in the traditional sense we\u2019ve come to expect from games in recent years. There is no matchmaking screen, no friend invite functionality, or even voice chat. Hell, you don\u2019t even get a say in when the multiplayer becomes a factor. So long as your <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">PlayStation 3</a> is online, at some point within the game, a second player, drawn randomly from the pool of other players making that very same journey, will simply appear alongside you. No, they don\u2019t just drop in out of thin air. It\u2019s more like you\u2019ll turn a corner, and suddenly they\u2019ll be standing there. Or you\u2019ll jump off a ledge, and they\u2019ll be waiting for you at the bottom. It\u2019s a completely seamless transition.</p><p style=\"\">But what does having two players actually do for the game? Mechanically, very little. There are no cooperative abilities to speak of, and no real communication between players to speak of. The sole mechanical benefit for working in tandem is that by standing close to one another, you can recharge each other\u2019s jump ability to the fullest. As for communication, the sole way to get the other player\u2019s attention is to use the \u201csing\u201d ability, a single button press that causes your character to let out a solitary note. Normally this mechanic is used to charge up de-energized cloth pieces around the world, but when another player is around, it becomes a kind of <i>de facto</i> Morse code.</p><p style=\"\">How you and your new-found companion choose to roll is entirely on each of you. You can stick together and experience the journey\u2019s end arm-in-arm (or, in this case, I suppose scarf-in-scarf is more accurate), or you may split off at some point. The first time I played through Journey, my companion left nearly as soon as they had arrived, which allowed me to finish the game on my own. The second time, I made it a point to stick by my new friend, and they seemingly did the same.</p><p style=\"\">It\u2019s difficult to describe what, exactly, it is that makes the act of playing through Journey with another traveler so much better, but it really is. There is something deeply cathartic and moving about pushing through the late game\u2019s obstacles together, looking out for one another as you climb, slide, and float past what pitfalls await you. Without giving much detail, I\u2019ll simply say that there is a single shot at the very end of the game (one that you control) that is an emotionally joyous experience when you come to it on your own. And yet, when I got to that same place with my compatriot, that joy became something transcendental and overwhelming. They say the greatest journeys are those shared with others; this Journey would appear to prove that.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1654111-5248621386_b8892b0b15_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1654111\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1654111-5248621386_b8892b0b15_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1654111\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1654111-5248621386_b8892b0b15_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1654111-5248621386_b8892b0b15_o.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Perhaps unsurprisingly, there's a bit more to Journey's world than just a big desert.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Perhaps some of you reading this might just shake your head at everything I\u2019ve described thus far, mostly because I\u2019ve described the game in largely superlative terms without really addressing the mechanics of the game itself, save but to say they are simple. Allow me to add that they are also effective, if that makes you feel any better. The greater point, however, is that you won\u2019t really have to think of them. There aren\u2019t many moments in Journey where you feel yourself concentrating on hitting the X button at a very specific time, or bemoaning the lack of jump energy currently at your disposal. Thoughts like that don\u2019t enter your head because the core design simply doesn\u2019t require them to.</p><p style=\"\">You\u2019re never so far from an energy boost that you\u2019ll have to backtrack just to navigate an obstacle. You\u2019re never \u201clost,\u201d exactly, because the game is incredibly adept at showing you where you ought to be going, while allowing for a bit of exploration and discovery on your own. I don\u2019t even recall dying at any point while playing Journey, though it is implied that you can. The easy accusation here, then, is that Journey is an incredibly easy game. That\u2019s true, though perhaps an overly-simplified explanation.</p><p style=\"\">Journey doesn\u2019t hold your hand. It doesn\u2019t tell you how you\u2019re expected to play it, and that\u2019s good. There\u2019s no HUD to speak of. What little information you do need to know about how much damage you have left to take, and how much jump ability remains is right there on your character's scarf. It's part of the natural world you've entered, with no distracting HUD elements to ruin the immersion. What few bits of reality do seep their way into Journey are, quite frankly, unwelcome. Namely the initial controller tutorial, which seems almost carelessly tossed into a game world otherwise unsoiled by button prompts, life meters, and whatever else. Everything Journey does is entirely in service of keeping you specifically focused on <i>your</i> experience. It goes out of its way to ensure that the only thing you\u2019re thinking about is the world that surrounds you, and that you, the player, are equally surrounded by it.</p><p style=\"\">And it does a hell of a job, too. The visual art alone in Journey is enough to captivate those that play it. Its character and architectural art is of that gorgeous pseudo-religious style that\u2019s informed everything from the modern day <a data-ref-id=\"3025-9\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda/3025-9/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda\">Legend of Zelda</a> games to the works of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3531\" href=\"/team-ico/3010-3531/\" slug=\"team-ico\">Team Ico</a>, and yet it remains distinctive and singular. It\u2019s mesmerizing stuff, made even better by breathtaking lighting effects and a sound design that\u2019s equal parts enrapturing and utterly unobtrustive. The score by composer Austin Wintory plays so perfectly into the emotional beats of the game world that it feels as much a part of the world as the ground you\u2019re standing on. But again, it's these aesthetic elements working in tandem with Journey's design that truly sucks you into the game. Every single moment of Journey feels painstakingly crafted. There aren't bugs, glitches, or wonky physics issues to worry about. If you can find a polygon out of place in Journey, it's most likely because you went searching for it.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1405915-bridges_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405915\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3068/1405915-bridges_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1405915\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3068/1405915-bridges_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3068/1405915-bridges_2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>As ruined worlds go, Journey's is simply awesome.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If there is a remaining quibble anyone might have, it will be Journey\u2019s length, though I assure you this is an unnecessary nitpick. Yes, Journey is a fairly short game, clocking in at around two hours of total playtime. The thing of it is, if you\u2019re going to think of Journey with the old idea of \u201cdollar value divided by number of hours equals quality of experience\u201d in mind, then you\u2019re going about this all wrong. Journey is not a single serving game. It\u2019s not meant to be played once and then abandoned. And while yes, the mechanics of it are quite simple, there is no reason you should even be thinking about those sorts of things while playing. If you\u2019re even still aware that you\u2019re holding a controller more than 15 minutes in, Journey may just not be for you.</p><p style=\"\">Who is Journey for, then? It is for those that are able to lose themselves in the experience. That is perhaps a vague, nebulous recommendation, but that\u2019s similarly the grand sum of Journey. It\u2019s not a game you can easily pigeonhole into a specific genre or niche. There isn't an easy \"if you like this, then you'll definitely like this\" kind of comparison to be made. Perhaps the blandest description I can give for it is that it is a game made more to be felt and appreciated rather than simply consumed, as we so often tend to do with new games nowadays. Journey may be a game predicated on familiar mechanics and concepts, but what it does with them is something that borders on revelatory.</p>", "deck": "Journey stands as a prime example of the truly remarkable things that can be done via this medium.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-479/", "platforms": "PlayStation Network (PS3)", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-31772/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/journey/3030-31772/", "id": 31772, "name": "Journey"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-03-13 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115518/", "id": 115518, "name": "Journey"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/i-am-alive-review/1900-480/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9967/2147492-screen_shot_2012_03_12_at_12.25.45_am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2147492\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9967/2147492-screen_shot_2012_03_12_at_12.25.45_am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2147492\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9967/2147492-screen_shot_2012_03_12_at_12.25.45_am.png\"></a><figcaption>Nobody said the apocalypse was going to be easy.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">For the first 30 minutes, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21107\" href=\"/i-am-alive/3030-21107/\" slug=\"i-am-alive\">I Am Alive</a> seems like one of the most refreshing games to come along in years. You're a determined guy who's spent the last year trekking across a ruined America to get back to what's left of your hometown, where you hope your wife and daughter have eked out their survival among the wreckage, or at least managed to evacuate to a safer place. Sifting through the rubble won't be easy. This is a survival horror game without the horror, in which every single bullet is precious and the evil lurks not in hordes of zombies or a shadowy corporation, but within the base hearts of those formerly ordinary people who have traded their humanity for a better chance of staying alive. But there are just as many innocents in the city trying to get by without resorting to killing, and possibly eating, their fellow man.</p><p style=\"\">The game focuses on the mundane exercise of surviving in a modern-day ruin, and makes an implied commitment to extreme realism by limiting your supplies and turning every encounter with other characters into a life-or-death affair--just like it would be, presumably, if the world really did end. In practice, I Am Alive breaks down pretty evenly into fetch quests, rote combat situations, and urban climbing sequences of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-957\" href=\"/uncharted/3025-957/\" slug=\"uncharted\">Uncharted</a> variety, so it's already more video-gamey than its stark concept would suggest. Still, I was more than willing to stomach a few old-hat design tropes in the hope they would cohere into a unique and memorable experience. In that light, it's a real shame I Am Alive falls so far short of making good on any of its grandiose ideas, almost right from the get-go.</p><p style=\"\">The most successful of I Am Alive's concepts is the focus on health and stamina as finite resources. Health never recharges after you lose it, but you can replenish it with predictably scarce food items. Stamina comes back quickly when you find a place to rest, but your total stamina <i>capacity</i> can drop if you push yourself past the limit in situations of duress. Those include any time you're climbing, or when you descend into the dusty netherworld of the city's street level. That Uncharted style of climbing has been criticized in the past for leading you by the hand with little chance of failure through absurdly dangerous situations, so I love the idea of adding some time pressure to your exploration. But the climbing controls are too awkward and unreliable to consistently get you where you want to go, so you often end up burning more stamina than you ought to. It's tough to comprehend the directions your character will sometimes climb when you're explicitly pushing a different direction on the stick. It's not fun.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9967/2147497-screen_shot_2012_03_12_at_12.25.57_am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2147497\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9967/2147497-screen_shot_2012_03_12_at_12.25.57_am.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2147497\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9967/2147497-screen_shot_2012_03_12_at_12.25.57_am.png\"></a><figcaption>The combat has some great ideas, if it only worked properly.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That clumsiness extends to the often lethal instances when you're interacting with other human beings. Similar to the way stamina constrains your climbing, I was more than ready to embrace the idea that not every enemy wears his ill intent on his sleeve, and some people aren't exactly friendly but also aren't out to kill you just for the sake of malice. But the game takes such a bald three-tiered approach to presenting NPCs that it's hard not to feel cynical about it after 15 minutes. People are either attack-on-sight bad guys, immobile innocents who want you to fetch them items, or (in rare cases) people who are perfectly happy to let you pass by, as long as you don't pass too close.</p><p style=\"\">It's the first group you'll spend the most time dealing with, as there are roving gangs all over the city ready to cut your throat just for laughs. Again, your methods of dealing with these guys break down into a tidy little list that includes shooting them, getting into a button-mashing \"struggle kill\" with your knife, kicking them into a fire or off a ledge, or performing a surprise throat-slash of your own if you let them approach you without attacking them yourself. It's that ability to threaten enemies that initially makes the combat seem interesting; if you don't pull your own weapon, enemies will saunter up to you, letting you get in that one crucial surprise kill without wasting one of your precious bullets... which you're not ever likely to have more than three or four of at a time. Once you do aim your gun (when the game switches to first-person), enemies with melee weapons will stop their advance, and you can even demand that they back away from you, which is handy for maneuvering them toward the nearest pit or fire.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The list of problems I ran into with the combat is a mile long. The biggest problem is that the special kill moves (and even the ability to threaten enemies back) all use the same button, and you're at the mercy of the game to provide you the right prompt to pull them off. But it's ridiculous how picky it is about where you and the enemy are standing, and how often it gives you the wrong prompt, or doesn't give you one at all. You might have a guy lined up with a fire expecting to kick him in, but instead you get the \"struggle kill\" prompt, which locks you into a button-mashing animation, and if there are other enemies around, they'll run up and cut you to death while you're trying to mash your way out of being totally defenseless.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122165/2143687-image_i_am_alive_18042_1712_0003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2143687\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.53834115805947\" data-width=\"639\" style=\"width: 639px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/122165/2143687-image_i_am_alive_18042_1712_0003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2143687\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122165/2143687-image_i_am_alive_18042_1712_0003.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/122165/2143687-image_i_am_alive_18042_1712_0003.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>I'm not holding my breath for a sequel to make good on this game's terrible ending.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I could give example after example. Armed enemies are always supposed to drop a bullet, but sometimes don't. Occasionally they dropped their guns on the level geometry in a way that prevented me from picking them up. Later on you get a bow and a single arrow, which is meant to be reusable, but the arrow disappeared several times after I used it, forcing me to restart to a checkpoint. Your retries are as finite as your health and stamina items, so it's inexcusable that you have to waste them so often just to make up for the game's basic mechanical failings. And don't even think about rolling back to a previous chapter via the ordinary-looking chapter select menu. When I did that, the game erased all of my progress past the chapter I picked, making me play through it all again.</p><p style=\"\">All that wonkiness might be worth putting up with if I Am Alive made good on what initially looks like a highly personal story of struggle and hope, but it doesn't even do that. The game frames the tale with occasional shots of a camcorder on a table, showing sequences of your quest recorded by your character himself, but that device is never used for anything meaningful. Worse, you abandon the search for your wife and daughter after about 20 minutes, spending the rest of the game acting as an errand boy for other characters you meet with almost no reference to the primary, personal reason you're here in the first place. Then the game culminates in one of the hastiest, most ramshackle endings I've seen in ages, resolving almost nothing and leaving at least one major character pretty much totally unaccounted for.</p><p style=\"\">I Am Alive is extra disappointing because it has so much potential right up front, and then wastes no time squandering all of it.

The fighting system in SFXT makes interesting updates to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a>'s 2D fighting formula that make for a wilder game without going all <a data-ref-id=\"3025-568\" href=\"/capcom-versus/3025-568/\" slug=\"capcom-versus\">Versus Series</a> along the way. The characters from Namco's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-333\" href=\"/tekken/3025-333/\" slug=\"tekken\">Tekken</a> franchise fit into the action surprisingly well, with some updates to make them fit into Capcom's ways of doing things sitting alongside just enough of the old stuff to evoke the essence of Tekken. But it's only at its peak when you're sitting next to another player, locally engaging in SFXT's brand of tag battles. Online, I found it to be a bit of a mess, and the game's attempts at meaningful character customization fall victim to layers and layers of slow-moving menus and a bundle of additional content that only serves to further confuse the issue.</p><p style=\"\">This game takes <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\" href=\"/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iv\">Street Fighter IV</a> as its base and works forward from there, removing focus attacks, allowing way more in-air juggles, and adding an arsenal of quick, easy combo chains and a handful of tag moves to help you get one character exchanged for your other. It also brings in a forward roll while getting up that mimics some of Tekken's wake-up game. But, most importantly, it brings in a ton of Tekken characters. The developers haven't turned all of those Iron Fist fighters into carbon copies of the Street Fighters, though some concessions have been made to make them fit a little tighter into the Capcom format. Some moves that would have required a lot of button tapping before have been turned into more traditional Street Fighter specials. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1941\" href=\"/hwoarang/3005-1941/\" slug=\"hwoarang\">Hwoarang</a>'s flying air kicks (the \"Hunting Hawk,\" if you will) have been converted to work via a simple hurricane kick-style motion. But some of the quick, button tapping combos of Tekken appear, as well. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-534\" href=\"/kazuya-mishima/3005-534/\" slug=\"kazuya-mishima\">Kazuya</a>'s 1, 1, 2 punch combo appears in the game pretty much intact, for example. The attempts to include just enough Tekken stuff prevents the \"new\" characters from just feeling like a batch of characters that, for the most part, don't toss projectiles. But it also makes them slightly trickier to pick up and use. When you're going up against a seemingly endless parade of online fighters that pick two Street Fighter characters every single time (<a data-ref-id=\"3005-212\" href=\"/ken-masters/3005-212/\" slug=\"ken-masters\">Ken</a>/<a data-ref-id=\"3005-103\" href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\" slug=\"ryu\">Ryu</a>, unsurprisingly, seems to be kind of popular), getting a feel for the Tekken guys and attempting to apply the things you've picked up offline or in the training modes can be something of a chore.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2106768-pt5108eng.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2106768\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2106768-pt5108eng.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2106768\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2106768-pt5108eng.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dan will take you through the training mode.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In addition to picking a team of characters, you can further customize things by equipping your fighters with gems. These gems come in the form of if-then statements, sort of like \"if you land 5 normal attacks, then your damage output is increased by 10 percent for 20 seconds.\" Some of the more substantial bonuses come with a penalty, like a lowered movement speed or decreased defense. There are also gems in place for lesser players, essentially turning on an Easy Operation style mode that makes it easier to do some moves, but these gems typically come with a substantial penalty. The gems themselves are an interesting idea, but the way they're implemented makes them more annoying than anything else.</p><p style=\"\">For starters, you won't have every single gem at your disposal. Even if you pay extra for the game's special edition, which comes with 45 additional gems, there are still plenty of additional slots for post-release gems, presumably as part of a paid download. On top of that, some of the gems that come with the more expensive version of the game are arguably better than the standard gems, which is sort of gross. It's not quite a full on \"pay to win\" problem, but it sure feels close. The gems themselves are also difficult to implement as they must be assigned on a per-character basis, and the default gem loadouts given by the game are bad, utilizing only two of the three potential slots. This means that, unless you're the sort of person that's only going to ever select one or two teams of characters, you sort of need to drag your way through the gem menus for every single character to build even a standard set of gems. You can create two sets for each character and choose between them when selecting your team, but the ability to create a few universal sets that can be applied to any character would have provided a good option for people who don't feel like tweaking every single fighter.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2106765-pt362.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2106765\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2106765-pt362.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2106765\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2106765-pt362.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2106765-pt362.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>If I could embed a sound file right here of the Tekken 2 announcer saying \"PAUL PHOENIX,\" I would.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The offline portion of Street Fighter X Tekken has the modes you'd expect to see from a modern Capcom fighting game, including a story mode that includes FMV endings for the \"official\" teams, training and trial modes, and a collection of local multiplayer modes that allow up to four players to play at the same time. Online is the part that's potentially more interesting, but it's pretty broken in its current implementation. The game seems to be attempting to implement a GGPO-like system where the action can roll back to the last synched position really quickly whenever latency gets in the way, ideally resulting in smooth-feeling gameplay that's better than the average net code. But SFXT has always felt a little off to me over the Internet, specifically when it comes to blocking. I feel like I'm constantly saying \"I totally blocked that\" as I eat up combo after combo.</p><p style=\"\">But the real problem is that the audio is completely broken during online matches. Sound effects stutter and get cut-off as the game rolls back and synchs up again, so voices don't play properly, hits don't have any sound associated with them, and the whole thing generally sounds like crap. Between these two probably-related things, the online feels pretty much unplayable whether you're going one-on-one in a ranked game or putting six players together in an endless lobby. The four-player scramble mode, which puts all four fighters on-screen at once, is just fine, but that mode is so insanely chaotic anyway that it sort of masks the other issues.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">It's a shame that the online is so off, because like I said before, the core of Street Fighter X Tekken is really cool. Even if you decide to ignore the Tekken characters, the fighters you know well from previous Capcom fighting games feel different because of the game's juggle system. And the Tekken fighters bring the whole thing up to a rather large roster of playable characters, giving you plenty--almost too much, actually--to learn. With cleaner online play it'd be easier to recommend, but if you don't mind an extra helping of Internet weirdness or have enough locals nearby to let you compete offline, it can be a hell of a good time.</p>", "deck": "Street Fighter X Tekken starts out with some amazingly fun updates to the classic Capcom style, but it's a real shame that the online mode is so awkward.

Namely, its stiff challenge, deep and brutal combo system, and overwhelming sensation of ninja bad-assery. Instead of any of these things, Ninja Gaiden 3 offers up an experience that practically holds your hand from beginning to end.

Certainly the loss of series creator <a data-ref-id=\"3040-38770\" href=\"/tomonobu-itagaki/3040-38770/\" slug=\"tomonobu-itagaki\">Tomonobu Itagaki</a> must have had some bearing on it, but Ninja Gaiden 3 is such a sharp left turn for the series that you'd almost think nobody who worked on this thing had ever played a game in the series before. Clearly that's not true, as there are any number of fan-service-oriented moments peppered throughout the campaign, but I wouldn't be surprised if most diehard fans never saw them, due to just quitting this thing out of disgust.</p><p style=\"\">The only explanation I can think of for Ninja Gaiden 3's existence is some mandated need to make Ninja Gaiden more accessible than its predecessors. It's certainly that. Where previous games in this series made me feel like the world's worst ninja time and time again, Ninja Gaiden 3 made me feel like pretty much nothing could kill me; because by and large, <i>nothing could</i>. I'm not talking about the easy mode, either. On the normal difficulty, Ninja Gaiden 3 is a total breeze. I died a few times during particularly disorienting boss fights, but those moments were rarities. Mostly, I just cut through the blade fodder in my way for the eight or nine hour duration of the campaign, with only a pitiful amount of resistance in front of me. And when I did find myself getting beat up, it was usually because the attack buttons aren't always as responsive as they should be.</p><p style=\"\">Yes, there is a hard difficulty, and while that does make the enemy AI tougher, it fails to address the fundamental problem with Ninja Gaiden 3: there is just no depth to it. The combat system, long the standard-bearer for action games of this type, has been reduced to a miserable, button-mashy bore. Alternate between the two attack buttons as you please, as it matters not what combination you hit them in. This game is far more <a data-ref-id=\"3025-169\" href=\"/dynasty-warriors/3025-169/\" slug=\"dynasty-warriors\">Dynasty Warriors</a> than Ninja Gaiden.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Even most of the spells and specialty weapons that made the earlier games so awesome are just altogether missing here. You get one magic spell. <i>One</i>. While I certainly enjoyed watching a giant flaming dragon emerge from my hands and swallow up all the enemies around me, it did, in fact, get old some time before the umpteenth time seeing this. It also makes the combat even easier, since it lays such effective waste to pretty much whatever happens to be standing in the room with you. As for the weapons, remember when Ninja Gaiden used to let you use all sorts of crazy weaponry? That's not the case anymore.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2131400-ninja_gaiden_3_19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2131400\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56260162601626\" data-width=\"615\" style=\"width: 615px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2131400-ninja_gaiden_3_19.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2131400\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18183/2131400-ninja_gaiden_3_19.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Looks tough, right? Nope.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This makes the additional difficulty siphoning steps taken by Team Ninja all the more baffling. Much has been made of the abundance of quick time events spread throughout Ninja Gaiden 3's campaign, and with good reason--they're remarkably dull. Yes, you'll see anti-hero <a data-ref-id=\"3005-104\" href=\"/ryu-hayabusa/3005-104/\" slug=\"ryu-hayabusa\">Ryu Hayabusa</a> fly through the air, land on moving helicopters, slash them into exploding debris, and land perfectly on two feet while killing enemies on the ground in the process, but in order to do all of that, you just press a button, or maybe two. One boss fight, in fact, ends with you literally holding down both trigger buttons for like 20 seconds. This might be a lot more tolerable were the underlying combat more fun, but combined with the brainless real-time action, it gives one the impression that Team Ninja intended for this game to be played by those who have never played video games before.</p><p style=\"\">Look, the idea of making Ninja Gaiden more accessible isn't a horrible one. After all, those earlier games could be punishing well beyond reason. The issue here is that Team Ninja went completely in the other direction. Instead of scaling back a little bit here and there to try and ease a new audience in, it just veers straight off a cliff.</p><p style=\"\">It's depressing, because you can see glimmers of good ideas buried within the monotonous gameplay. While the lack of limb severing attacks this time around is a bummer, the game is nonetheless bloody, and full of absolutely brutal looking attacks that become even more so when you slice straight into an enemy, and find yourself mashing buttons to cut through whatever bone your sword happens to run into. It's the one cathartic thing Ninja Gaiden 3 has going for it, but surrounded by so much mediocre stab-'em-up gameplay and outright stupidity, it's nowhere near enough to keep you interested.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2137186-422191_236728679750975_163288313761679_505682_260333421_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2137186\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56\" data-width=\"750\" style=\"width: 750px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2137186-422191_236728679750975_163288313761679_505682_260333421_n.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2137186\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18183/2137186-422191_236728679750975_163288313761679_505682_260333421_n.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18183/2137186-422191_236728679750975_163288313761679_505682_260333421_n.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>I'm not completely sure why this multiplayer mode exists. I'm not sure Team Ninja does either.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Speaking of stupidity, Ninja Gaiden 3 has a plot. Yes, I know. Ninja Gaiden games are always kind of nonsensical and weird, but this one really goes for the gusto in terms of making absolutely no fucking sense whatsoever. It's the kind of stream-of-consciousness nonsense you'd expect to hear blurted out of the mouth of a particularly hyperactive twelve-year-old, full of demon prophecies, evil corporations trying to destroy the world because of <i>reasons</i>, evil alchemists also trying to destroy the world because who the hell knows, and also healthy doses of rather unpleasant misogyny; the kind that goes beyond the usual absurd boob jiggling (of which there is plenty) I might add. Look, Team Ninja is not generally who I look to for thoughtful female character interactions in my video games, but it gets pretty over-the-top here.</p><p style=\"\">What's even worse is that there is an air of self-importance to Ninja Gaiden 3 that is completely unearned. The plot mostly revolves around Ryu moaning over his life as a \"murderer,\" due to a curse put on him that basically makes his arm morph into an increasingly monstrous, blood-red demon...thing, that also gives him special powers. The few times the game actually bothers to do something with all this new-found character pathos, it all but disregards it moments later, when Ryu is cutting dudes to pieces like nothing ever happened. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised. This game can't even keep its core plot on track, much less build upon any narrative ideas that go beyond \"STAB THAT DUDE.\"</p><p style=\"\">Case in point: There is an entire mission section smack dab in the middle of the game where Ryu goes back to his village and then goes and fights a bunch of ninjas because... I guess the designers realized he'd been fighting too many soldiers and genetically-engineered monsters, and not enough ninjas? It's a senseless divergence that is even more maddening when you realize the game never bothers to explain any of it, and in fact seems to forget that it even happened. How the hell are you going to make me fight a skyscraper-sized witch demon for 15 minutes and then just completely forget to explain <i>why</i>?</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2127098-o20.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2127098\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56117021276596\" data-width=\"752\" style=\"width: 752px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/18183/2127098-o20.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2127098\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18183/2127098-o20.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/18183/2127098-o20.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>If you're mainly here to get an eyeful of Chesty McNinjalady, you'll be sad to hear she's barely in this game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Maybe I'm trying too hard to find logic where there is none. It certainly doesn't feel like Team Ninja really gave too terribly much of a damn about any of its ideas here. It got them working well enough to be functional (though sometimes camera glitches and unresponsive controls negate that), and looking reasonably good (the game is pretty sharp visually). That's especially true of the game's inexplicable multiplayer component, which allows players to fight each other in arena battles, or take on wave after wave of bad guys with a co-op buddy. You may be shocked to learn that these modes reek of non-effort. They work, but the twitchy camera, combined with the cramped-feeling environments, pretty much kills what little fun there was to be had. If anything, this multiplayer component just seems like an excuse to tack an online pass onto the game.</p><p style=\"\">Maybe those still left at Team Ninja just assumed that the visual splendor of seeing Ryu Hayabusa stab things into oblivion (as well as the occasional side-character boob jiggle) was all players wanted out of a Ninja Gaiden game. The combo system and intense challenge didn't matter so much as the mere visual of Ryu flying around like a unstoppable death machine. This assumption would be incorrect. Ninja Gaiden is great because you feel like you are actually accomplishing something when you best it. You feel like you've actually overcome an obstacle worth overcoming. Sure, there were changes that could have been implemented to perhaps make the game a bit less overwhelmingly aggressive in its hatred of the player's success, such as the legitimately improved checkpoint system and even a few of those quick time events tossed in from time to time. But killing the combat system that made this franchise so enticing, and robbing it of any modicum of challenge was so far beyond what was necessary that it leaves Ninja Gaiden 3 feeling like little more than a stripped-down husk of its former glory. If the previous Ninja Gaiden games were like carefully built, brutally fast hot rods, Ninja Gaiden 3 feels like it should be up on bricks on somebody's lawn.</p>", "deck": "Ninja Gaiden 3 is little more than a shadow of the games that came before it.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-482/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32687/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ninja-gaiden-3/3030-32687/", "id": 32687, "name": "Ninja Gaiden 3"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2012-03-23 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114878/", "id": 114878, "name": "Ninja Gaiden 3"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/sine-mora-review/1900-483/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2079501-sinemorascreen10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079501\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.425\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2079501-sinemorascreen10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079501\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2079501-sinemorascreen10.jpg\"></a><figcaption>As shooters go, this one is gorgeous.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The sort of tough-as-nails retro gameplay you associate with the phrase \"bullet hell\" is usually the domain of obscure homebrewed PC projects spawning from lone developers in Japanese basements, but Xbox Live Arcade's new shooter Sine Mora goes the extra mile, marrying wonderful mainstream production values to its endless onslaught of side-scrolling enemies. Maybe it's no surprise that such an offbeat project sprang from the rogue developers at <a data-ref-id=\"3040-89591\" href=\"/goichi-suda/3040-89591/\" slug=\"goichi-suda\">Suda 51</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2188\" href=\"/grasshopper-manufacture-inc/3010-2188/\" slug=\"grasshopper-manufacture-inc\">Grasshopper Manufacture</a>, which contributed art and sound design to the production otherwise handled by Hungarian developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-656\" href=\"/digital-reality-ltd/3010-656/\" slug=\"digital-reality-ltd\">Digital Reality</a>. The result is one of the most original arcade-style action games to come along in a while, but one that stumbles a bit when the rubber meets the road... er, the ship meets the air? You know, the part where you play it.</p><p style=\"\">The length of Sine Mora certainly harkens back to the days of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-419\" href=\"/r-type/3025-419/\" slug=\"r-type\">R-Type</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-261\" href=\"/gradius/3025-261/\" slug=\"gradius\">Gradius</a>, since the story mode will only last you around 90 minutes, and that's counting the surprisingly lengthy cutscenes. Even more surprising is the game's adult tone and subject matter, which primarily deals with total warfare and ethnic cleansing, and features such downtrodden figures as a father grimly focused on avenging his son's murder, and a female pilot who survives a rape only to be blackmailed into fighting for a cause she cares nothing about. Also, all the characters are animal people of various, unrelated types. Also, there's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-73\" href=\"/time-travel/3015-73/\" slug=\"time-travel\">time travel</a>? I'd sum all this up more succinctly if the game's storyline were easier to follow, but each chapter jumps so disjointedly between locations, time periods, events and characters (who merely exist as static portraits with voiceover) that the broad narrative doesn't really start to cohere until the very end of the game. Until then, it's hard to form a clear picture of exactly what's going on, and what seems like a promising storyline--a rarity in itself for this genre--ends up falling a little flat.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2079499-sinemorascreen08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079499\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.425\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2079499-sinemorascreen08.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079499\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2079499-sinemorascreen08.jpg\"></a><figcaption>HELL. OF. BULLETS.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Sine Mora has some interesting high-level mechanics layered on top of all the flying to the right and shooting, most of which--in keeping with the storyline--focus on time. Second only to dodging and shooting everything around you, your most important concern is to keep an eye on a timer that's constantly ticking down at the top of the screen, because as soon as that timer runs out, you die. Every enemy you kill increments the timer, so killing as much stuff as possible is key to staying alive. You can't die just by being hit by something (with a few annoying exceptions), but every hit shaves precious seconds off that clock, so it's just as important to avoid trouble as it is to take out enemies. You also have a limited ability to slow down time at will, which naturally helps you do both of those things. Most of the game is designed in such a way that you can maneuver through the onslaught of enemies and bullets with quick reflexes and deft use of the time ability, but there are too many occasions, almost all in boss fights, that hit you with some unavoidable instant-death attack that you can't realistically dodge if you don't know it's coming. Those moments pretty much force you to memorize them if you want to get through unscathed.</p><p style=\"\">The game offers an appropriate slew of other power-ups that give you a shield, let you use a pilot-specific super weapon, and--most importantly--dramatically increase the power of your main gun. That's where the gameplay broke down for me. At default gun power, even the weakest enemies take a few shots to kill, though with something like 10 upgrade levels for that gun, you can lay waste to everything in sight once you power it up sufficiently. Since your ability to kill a lot of enemies and add to your timer is absolutely crucial to keeping you alive, you want to get those upgrades up as fast as you can. Taking a single hit causes all of your upgrades to fly out of your ship and drift around aimlessly, though, and if that happens in the middle of a hectic hail of bullets, you can just about give up on getting all (or in some cases any) of them back without taking more hits, which will deplete your spare time real fast. That feels a little like a catch-22. If you have to hang back and let those power-ups float away, your firepower is often so diminished that you don't have much hope of killing enough enemies to keep your time up until the next checkpoint. More often than I would have liked, this creates a negative feedback loop where doing poorly diminishes your subsequent ability to improve your performance, almost guaranteeing you'll do even <i>more</i> poorly in the remaining few seconds before you die. Sine Mora has a sound framework and I was more than ready to submit to its retro brutality, but the downward-spiraling weapon system coupled with the memorization-heavy bosses and some occasional nonsensical bullet patterns often made the game feel frustrating in the wrong way.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2079497-sinemorascreen06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079497\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.425\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:42.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2079497-sinemorascreen06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2079497\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2079497-sinemorascreen06.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2079497-sinemorascreen06.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Things aren't exactly rosy in Sine Mora's world.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you're the sort of casual player who might play through this game once and be done with it, the 90-minute story is a hard sell at the $15 price. But those who identify with terms like \"1CC\" and \"superplay,\" or even slightly less committed shooter fans who just want to chase a few high scores, will find plenty of extra stuff to spend time on. Arcade mode offers the full sequence of levels in one long, unbroken run sans cutscenes, though it's a shame that this mode's lowest difficulty is hard, which is... really hard. On the upside, you can mix and match ships and pilots to get different basic and special attack combos, and optionally swap out the time dilation power for a brief rewind or a bullet-reflect shield. Boss training and score attack modes offer other ways to dig into the action piecemeal, and even higher difficulty levels present a truly ludicrous degree of challenge for the hardest of core. The game even embeds a long list of individual challenges into each achievement, so if you really wanted to do everything in this game, it would probably take you ages.</p><p style=\"\">Seeing the amount of careful thought the developers lavished on every aspect of Sine Mora's design continually made me wish that the core action had clicked more solidly for me.

But even at that lower-than-average price, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-382\" href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/\" slug=\"namco-bandai-games-inc\">Namco</a>'s latest feels like a con. It has a criminally low number of courses that have all appeared in previous <a data-ref-id=\"3025-396\" href=\"/ridge-racer/3025-396/\" slug=\"ridge-racer\">Ridge Racer</a> games, no interesting career structure whatsoever, a new car customizing feature that somehow manages to make the \"machines\" feel less unique, and a bunch of music that also appeared in the old games. You'd have to be extremely hard up for any form of ridge racing for this to add up to something worth purchasing.</p><p style=\"\">OK, very quickly, let's go over what Ridge Racer is for people that might not have played it before. It's a driving game with an emphasis on drifting around sharp corners, but it has a handling model that automatically takes over most of the steering when you drift, so as long as your tires are squealing, the game will automatically whip you around corners with little input from the player. Much of the game, then, turns into properly timing the release of the accelerator, which causes you to lose traction and start a drift. Then you must attempt to correct your course as soon as possible once the turn is complete, so you can regain traction and start properly accelerating. It feels nothing like real driving and it's a system that probably made a lot of sense when the franchise debuted in arcades back around 1993. These days, with racing games becoming both more realistic and more nuanced, whether they're attempting to simulate real driving or not, Namco's franchise feels like a relic. That's not inherently good or bad--I actually quite like Ridge Racer's core tenets of \"Always Be Drifting\" and \"If You Have To Hit The Brakes, You're Doing It Wrong.\" But you should know that it's a very specific flavor of driving that will probably baffle newer players.</p><p style=\"\">On the Vita, Ridge Racer doesn't stray far from its past. In fact, an overwhelming majority of the available content is ripped right out of previous Ridge Racer games, from the PSP and PS3 releases. The tracks are old, most of the music came out of a previous Ridge Racer game, and the car design is, well, directly in line with what you'd expect from previous games in the series. It's one thing to evoke a sense of Ridge Racer's past, but much like many of the recent Ridge Racer releases, this Vita version simply lifts things from the other games and dumps them on you again. So even at its relatively low price, this doesn't feel like a good deal. It's worth noting that the US version of the game comes with a \"gold pass\" for a limited time that gives you access to a handful of DLC add-ons for free, but these extra tracks are also old, and the additional music and vehicles you can acquire this way don't really add much to the overall package.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2068091-rrvita3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2068091\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56640625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2068091-rrvita3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2068091\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2068091-rrvita3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>How about this one?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's a shame that the content is totally lacking, because there's a trim, but effective set of options in the game that show that at least someone on the development is thinking about the future of Ridge Racer. Rather than dragging you into a huge list of single-player events that form some sort of career mode, Ridge Racer gives you access to everything right away. You can set up spot races that pit you against the traditional collection of AI racers, but the main bit of Ridge Racer is the ability to download ghosts of other human racers and attempt to beat their times. If you do, you can upload your ghost back to the server, letting other players take you on. There's also an interesting, but sort of half-baked team system that has you pick one of four teams when you first start. A daily mission system lets you know which of the other teams are your direct enemies on that specific day, giving you an incentive to seek out ghosts from those opposing teams. The game also has direct online play, allowing up to eight players to unite over the Internet and race on the same anemic selection of tracks again and again. This is another way to gain victories over the opposing teams. But those victories don't reliably funnel into more funds for upgrades or anything, so it doesn't feel like there's enough of a payoff for jumping through the hoops and fighting the right players.</p><p style=\"\">The upgrade system is a flowchart of annoying boxes that let you change the way nitrous works on your car at first, but eventually you can get slipstream add-ons and other abilities. This is where the now-standard Ridge Racer systems like Flex Nitrous and Ultimate Charge come into play. You can equip three upgrades at once, but each upgrade is tagged to one of three groups, and you can only equip one from each group. This, presumably, is how the developers hope to maintain some sort of balance in the system. It's fine, but the upgrade tree is saddled with lame hints that must be paid for and unlocked before you can advance along the tree and get actual upgrades for your vehicles. Also, with the upgrade system and a slider that lets you make any car a \"mild\" or \"dynamic\" drifting car, the differences between vehicles are essentially nonexistent. Given the past of unlocking various special cars with unique abilities, this manages to make all the cars feel a little plain.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Visually, the game looks decent, with a frame rate that's smooth enough to convey a solid sense of speed. There's also a nice depth-of-field effect in place that makes distant objects appropriately blurry. But that's still not enough to make this feel like a worthwhile package. As a fan of Ridge Racer, the way the past few games have just rehashed existing track designs is borderline offensive. Packing up an even smaller list of old content and selling it at a \"discount\" price doesn't make this Vita version any better. I suppose there's a case to be made that lapsed Ridge Racer fans who haven't seen these tracks a million times already might find the Vita release to be more appealing, but... that's a pretty narrow group.</p>", "deck": "The Vita version of Ridge Racer is light on content, and the vast majority of what's actually here has appeared in previous Ridge Racer games.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-484/", "platforms": "PlayStation Vita", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35647/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ridge-racer/3030-35647/", "id": 35647, "name": "Ridge Racer"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2012-03-27 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-114134/", "id": 114134, "name": "Ridge Racer"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/south-park-tenormans-revenge-review/1900-485/", "description": "<p style=\"\">Somewhere in between my roughly dozenth try at one of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-36686\" href=\"/south-park-tenormans-revenge/3030-36686/\" slug=\"south-park-tenormans-revenge\">South Park: Tenorman's Revenge's</a> later-game levels and the soul-crushing realization that I had nowhere near enough \"time cores\" to unlock the next level--not because I had been lazy about collecting them, but because that was the developer's intent all along--I tapped out.

Even the worst games often have the potential somewhere within them to eventually do something cool (even if they rarely ever make good on that potential), and it's always struck me as unfair to judge a game until you've seen at least a taste of everything it has to offer. It takes a special kind of haphazardly designed junk to get me to throw down my controller out of frustration and outright hatred, and South Park: Tenorman's Revenge is such a game. Unless the endgame of Tenorman's Revenge suddenly repairs its busted controls, atrociously laggy netcode, and straight-up awful level design, I have a hard time imagining anything positive coming out of whatever chunk of this game remained untested by my hands.</p><p style=\"\">I'm not sure why it's so remarkably difficult to turn <i>South Park</i> into a playable game. Other developers have tried and failed many times over, though Tenorman's Revenge deserves a special place in Hell for its outright butchering of the material. Things start out promisingly enough, with an opening preamble from an elder of the hyper-intelligent sea otters featured in the \"Go God Go\" episode describing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5484\" href=\"/eric-cartman/3005-5484/\" slug=\"eric-cartman\">Eric Cartman's</a> sort of epic battle with noted ginger and accidental cannibal Scott Tenorman. Through this animated intro, we learn of Tenorman's plot for revenge, which includes stealing Cartman's Xbox 360 hard drive, and also unleashing hordes of ginger-haired robots on the world. The animation of this stuff immediately pops out as a positive point, doing a fine job of emulating the look and feel of the show. Unfortunately, that's the only thing developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6697\" href=\"/other-ocean-interactive/3010-6697/\" slug=\"other-ocean-interactive\">Other Ocean Interactive</a> got right.</p><p style=\"\">Tenorman's Revenge is not funny. Not even a little bit. Even the worst licensed games usually find some way to tap into the core appeal of what people like about the thing that's been licensed, but the way Tenorman's Revenge tries to emulate <i>South Park's</i> sense of humor is by mailing it in with a bunch of lazily tossed together references. Hey, remember Mr. Hankey? Manbearpig? Towelie? They're all there, and you're supposed to laugh at them...um, being there? I guess? I can only assume this because there aren't any jokes here. Sometimes Cartman says something about Kenny's poor family. Sometimes Cartman makes a crack about Jews. Sometimes Cartman says \"motherfucker.\" These are the things that you're theoretically supposed to chuckle at, but you don't, because they're not funny. They're badly timed, completely lazy, and frankly so overly familiar that you can't help but wonder if the developers wrote this script purely based on whatever <i>South Park</i> clips have the most hits on YouTube.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Without a solid story to care about or at least jokes to laugh at, Tenorman's Revenge is forced to rely on its gameplay to hook players in. This is borderline tragic for a couple of reasons. First off, this is a platformer in which the jump button does not work properly. Yes, it does make you jump, but it does so with just the slightest hint of delay, and features such floaty, bizarre physics that it's damn near impossible to land on any platform that's even a little bit awkwardly placed without multiple tries. I could see this being acceptable if Tenorman's Revenge were a relatively straightforward, no-frills platformer that mostly involved running to the right and occasionally jumping on bad guys, but this is not the case. If anything, Tenorman's Revenge is a convoluted nightmare of alternate paths, constantly moving platforms, endless collectables, and gobs and gobs of bad guys that like to spawn right on top of your head.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2163518-screenlg3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2163518\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2163518-screenlg3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2163518\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2163518-screenlg3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>...but badly designed levels, shoddy controls, and a ludicrously awful campaign progression kill this game dead.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">I'm not really sure what Other Ocean was going for here. There are glimmers of other classic platformers from the 8- and 16 bit eras here, so one can surmise that the idea here was to craft something that felt \"old school\" challenging. A delightful notion, except for the fact that the best games of that era demanded perfection while also providing you controls that felt correct for the challenges at hand. The lackluster control mechanics of Tenorman's Revenge aren't merely inadequate, they work <i>aggressively against you</i>. And then you have all these ginger robots to contend with. They're not overly difficult on their own, but they're hardly ever on their own. The game tosses piles of them (again, sometimes directly over top of your head) and expects you to somehow balance jumping on their heads over and over again without accidentally landing somewhere close to another one without getting hit. Fun fact: that never happens. The best bet is to use one of the few random weapons often floating around the world, though that gets pretty dull pretty fast.</p><p style=\"\">Instead, whatever character you choose is beaten, pummeled, dunked in acid, dunked in human pee, and whatever the hell else over and over again until you just can't take it anymore. What makes it even more insulting is that the boss fights that come after all this abuse and torment are insipidly easy. Every boss I ran into operated on lazy, easy-to-recognize patterns and required only a modicum of effort to defeat. All that effort for so little payoff is just brutal on top of brutal. It's like surviving horrible trial after horrible trial just to survive, and then finding out all you have to do is kick a handicapped person in the shins to move forward.</p><p style=\"\">That is, of course, assuming you've collected enough time cores to do so. Time cores are the game's currency for progress. If you collect enough, you can just move straight on to the next stage. If you haven't, you're stuck going back and replaying earlier levels until you have enough. The issue isn't really that lack of exploration ensures you won't find enough of them. In fact, you can explore all you want, but if you're playing solo, or frankly with anything less than four total players, you're hosed, because several cores in every level are hidden behind character-specific sections. You see, each character has a couple of unique abilities that let them do things like bust through walls (via Cartman's stomach) or jump really high, because apparently <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5680\" href=\"/kenny-mccormick/3005-5680/\" slug=\"kenny-mccormick\">Kenny</a> can do that. There are also bits that allow specific characters to turn into the superhero versions of themselves (The Coon, Mysterion, and so forth). Again, if you are playing solo, that means you will have to play through multiple levels multiple times as at least two or three different kids in order to collect more time cores.</p><p style=\"\">So, here's the thing about this. This is always a terrible design decision. <i>Always.</i> I don't care how good your core gameplay is. If you have to force players to go back through your game multiple times over just to get to the later levels, you have fucked things up beyond any measure of repair. It's fairly obvious that Other Ocean paid no real mind to the notion that people would roll through Tenorman's Revenge with less than three friends at all times. The co-op has no easy drop-in/drop-out functionality, and playing solo ensures that you'll have to repeat levels a minimum of two more times just to get enough time cores to succeed. It's even worse because often the cores are hidden behind a 30 second side-section of a level that you haven't seen before, ensuring that 99% of what you're slogging through is something you've already done (and probably hated) before.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2163517-screenlg2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2163517\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/2163517-screenlg2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2163517\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2163517-screenlg2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/2163517-screenlg2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Good games inspire you to go back and play them again because they're fun. Tenorman's Revenge forces you to replay levels to even progress.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">As if Tenorman's Revenge weren't already enough of a cruel joke, the co-op doesn't even work particularly well. Online, the netcode is a disaster. Players seemed to randomly drop in and out, and lag made the already unwieldy jumping controls about a thousand times worse. Offline co-op negates the lag, but it still suffers from the other fundamental issue: the camera. The developers tried to rectify the absurd amount of zoom required to fit all characters on screen by having players off-camera for too long respawn next to whoever is further along, but it's only half a fix. The camera still zooms out way too much, and does so in kind of a chuggy way that sometimes leaves your character and the pit/enemy/laser beam/whatever else in front of them totally obscured. It's a recipe for accidental death in a game that's already an accidental death smorgasbord.</p><p style=\"\">Maybe my inability to soldier on through this half-busted garbage to its laborious conclusion puts an asterisk on this review for you. I don't mind, because I'm comfortable with my decision to abandon this thing in favor of doing literally anything else with my time. I'm comfortable with the notion that a game can be so fundamentally busted that there is no point in continuing on past the point of peak frustration. I'm comfortable in saying that South Park: Tenorman's Revenge is a gigantic middle-finger extended in the direction of anyone who might actually want to enjoy a game featuring the myriad memorable characters and storylines of <i>South Park</i> in video game form.

In fact, my love of Star Wars starts and stops with that hallowed original trilogy, a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2294\" href=\"/star-wars-x-wing/3030-2294/\" slug=\"star-wars-x-wing\">handful</a> of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19727\" href=\"/star-wars-tie-fighter/3030-19727/\" slug=\"star-wars-tie-fighter\">memorable</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11023\" href=\"/star-wars-dark-forces/3030-11023/\" slug=\"star-wars-dark-forces\">games</a> from the '90s, and one halfway decent <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thrawn_trilogy\" rel=\"nofollow\">series of books</a>. I've had well over a decade now to accept the modern reality of Star Wars as a pandering, dramatically bankrupt cash grab, so there's no good reason I should find <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31714\" href=\"/kinect-star-wars/3030-31714/\" slug=\"kinect-star-wars\">Kinect Star Wars</a> especially disappointing. It's not like I expected much from it in the first place. Look at the name: it's just two disparate brands lazily shoved into a single logo that screams \"THIS IS THE THING WITH THE <a data-ref-id=\"3055-70\" href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70/\" slug=\"lightsaber\">LIGHTSABERS</a> AND IT USES THAT EXPENSIVE CAMERA YOU BOUGHT.\"</p><p style=\"\">Still, with the two halves of this game so clearly identified right upfront, you'd hope this might at least be a good Kinect game or a good Star Wars property, if not both. But it's neither. Some argue that the game isn't for adults, but just because it's clearly targeted at younger ages doesn't mean it can't also appeal to people of <i>all</i> ages if it's made well. And sure, most kids will gleefully waggle their hands in front of whatever crap you put in front of them, but that doesn't mean you should put crap in front of them. Kids deserve to have their intellects stimulated, not insulted. Kinect Star Wars fails to tell an engaging or original story in the Star Wars fiction, instead opting for the path of least resistance by cobbling together a clearinghouse of familiar characters, places, and events into a bland amalgam that resembles the movies in structure but doesn't even try to approach them (the good ones, at least) in emotional resonance.</p><p style=\"\">There's been plenty of slack-jawed bafflement at the <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4OnDizZ7UT0\" rel=\"nofollow\">footage</a> of the game's dancing mode that's been making the rounds. But in my mind Kinect Star Wars' chief offender is the story-based Jedi Destiny mode that casts you as a nameless padawan, slashing and Force-pushing your way through five hours of battle droids and Trandoshan lizardmen, because those seem to be the only bad guys worth fighting in the Star Wars universe. There's nothing remotely interesting about this mode. On the story side, you simply jump from one familiar prequel locale to the next, every few minutes meeting with Yoda or jumping between skiffs over a Sarlaac monster or teaming up with a rakish vagabond who sure dresses and acts a lot like Han Solo. Not far in you'll take control of your own ship, which is practically a dead ringer for the Millennium Falcon and is manned by a silver-skinned <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4030\" href=\"/c-3po/3005-4030/\" slug=\"c-3po\">C3PO</a> facsimile and a Wookiee pilot just like Chewb... wait, that <i>is</i> <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2828\" href=\"/chewbacca/3005-2828/\" slug=\"chewbacca\">Chewbacca</a>.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2168670-ksw_screenshot_173.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2168670\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2168670-ksw_screenshot_173.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2168670\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2168670-ksw_screenshot_173.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Jedi duels aren't nearly as cool as they should be.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That ramshackle assembly of Star Wars cliches might be easier to tolerate if the gameplay were any good, but it merely recreates what would be the most simplistic of third-person action games if you were playing it with a controller. In addition to swinging your trusty saber you can Force push and lift stuff, and kick enemies when they're in your face. Since a lightsaber cuts down everything in its way, the game quickly rolls out a variety of enemies who can block your saber swings, but a quick hop will make your Jedi somersault over them so you can hit them in the back. Cue five hours of jumping over guys and hitting them in the back, then one of the least climactic final battles with a nameless Sith warrior, then an underwhelming awards ceremony that looks to be lifted shot-for-shot out of the end of <i>A New Hope</i>. The occasional Jedi dueling that punctuates this mode could have been interesting if you had direct control over your saber, but instead it's a block-by-numbers affair where your enemy attacks high, low, left, or right, and you have to respond a few times, then slash them a bit. Then repeat three or four times. Fighting with a lightsaber is practically what motion controls were made for, so it's especially disappointing that this mode turned out to be so rote and boring.</p><p style=\"\">The podracing component is actually the closest thing in Kinect Star Wars to a traditional video game, mainly because it directly apes the format of that old arcade podracing game from years ago. Each of your outstretched hands controls one of the two pods, and it's genuinely impressive how quickly your hand movements correspond to the steering controls. Most Kinect controls seem plagued with at least a little latency, but the steering here feels almost one-to-one with your movements. Unfortunately, all the other controls--jumping your pod, repairing, using weapons--use those same two hands, and the game is bad about making you use a power-up <i>and</i> steer in that direction at the same time. The racing action is rudimentary to begin with and doesn't really benefit from motion controls anyway, once the novelty of the steering wears off, and the whole six-race story mode here only lasts about 90 minutes anyway.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2168669-dance_c3po_unlock01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2168669\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"720\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2168669-dance_c3po_unlock01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2168669\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2168669-dance_c3po_unlock01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2168669-dance_c3po_unlock01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Noooooo comment.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There's not actually much else to round out the Kinect Star Wars package.

It doesn't matter who you claim Kinect Star Wars is for, it's a shoddy product on almost every level. There are a few glimmers of what could have been in here, but this is not the game that legitimizes Kinect as a game-playing device, nor does it do a single thing to restore any vibrancy or value to the Star Wars license.

XBLA may have looked like little more than a trifle early on, but as the years went on and developers became more and more aware of what kinds of things could actually be done via a digital platform, innovative, provocative, and straight-up brilliant games began to evolve out of the digital primordial ooze.

This puzzle game from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-7671\" href=\"/spikysnail-games/3010-7671/\" slug=\"spikysnail-games\">SpikySnail Games Studio</a> feels like some lost XBLA title from 2006, like it just wandered in from the cold after years adrift at sea, totally unaware of what's happened in the six years that transpired since. Its insubstantial puzzle mechanics and generally bare-bones presentation are the stuff of yesteryear, somehow transplanted into a time that's all but forgotten that games like it ever existed. I don't say this to accuse The Splatters of being a terrible game, because it certainly isn't. But it's hard to get too excited about a game that feels more like it should have been collecting dust on your hard drive alongside <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11021\" href=\"/cloning-clyde/3030-11021/\" slug=\"cloning-clyde\">Cloning Clyde</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8047\" href=\"/marble-blast-ultra/3030-8047/\" slug=\"marble-blast-ultra\">Marble Blast Ultra</a> for the last half a decade, as opposed to appearing in 2012 for a $10 price tag.</p><p style=\"\">That antiquated feeling permeates every aspect of The Splatters. The cutesy visuals don't offer much beyond a few adorable blobs and some peculiarly inconsistent level art--like, why is there a giant shoe on this one level, while another features a giant soccer ball embedded in the geometry? The music and audio effects sound culled from the bottom of the license-free barrel. And the mechanics, momentarily interesting as they are, fail to evolve into anything beyond a halfway interesting physics demonstration.</p><p style=\"\">The Splatters takes its premise from the \"death in service of awesome\" concept more or less created by the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-451\" href=\"/lemmings/3025-451/\" slug=\"lemmings\">Lemmings</a> series, and used time and time again in modern downloadable games, including recent titles like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31798\" href=\"/swarm/3030-31798/\" slug=\"swarm\">Swarm</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-36971\" href=\"/world-gone-sour/3030-36971/\" slug=\"world-gone-sour\">World Gone Sour</a>. The titular Splatters are colorful, sentient blobs, whose sole purpose in life is to be flung at gooey strings of \"bombs\" that explode when contacted by the blobs in their liquid form. In order to blow up these gooey bomb strings, you launch the Splatter folk at them, aiming to make them explode into a slimy mess all over the bombs, which then explode.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Think of it like a mix between <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1879\" href=\"/angry-birds/3025-1879/\" slug=\"angry-birds\">Angry Birds</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32560\" href=\"/puddle/3030-32560/\" slug=\"puddle\">Puddle</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18059\" href=\"/pain/3030-18059/\" slug=\"pain\">PAIN</a>, if that simplifies things a bit. You're killing these blob dudes to create stunts, which are long chains of maneuvers that allow your blob to destroy vast strings of bombs in one fell swoop. In order to do this, you've got a few different moves at your disposal. You can re-launch yourself mid-air to change direction, double-tap the A button to send your blob flying like a laser-guided missile (and creating a massive burst of Splatter goo in the process), and even reverse time/physics to bring wayward bombs back toward your perpetually raining goo.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1862623-splattersg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862623\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1862623-splattersg.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862623\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1862623-splattersg.jpg\"></a><figcaption>At best, The Splatters is a minor amusement. At worst, it's an expensive trip back to when XBLA games were usually just diluted echoes of better games.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's these mechanics, and the unpredictable (in a good way) physics that give The Splatters some legs. If it were just about shooting blobs at weird looking things that lightly explode, then it would literally be the dullest game currently on XBLA. Messing with these different maneuvers gives the gameplay a bit of variety and a moderate amount of satisfaction. It is legitimately kind of cool when you shoot a blob in one direction, have it fly back in another, and then reverse the physics a few times to nail some extra bombs you wouldn't otherwise hit.</p><p style=\"\">Unfortunately, the number of maneuvers you're given to play with runs out pretty quickly, and that variety dwindles. For a few hours, The Splatters is a decent amusement. Playing through the various stunt- and combo-oriented stages is fun for a few hours, but after that it wears thin. There is the option to keep pushing for crazier and crazier stunts, which you can then post up on the game's equivalent of YouTube for Splattering, but even the most ludicrous stunts on there aren't quite ludicrous enough to justify spending hours trying to generate them.</p><p style=\"\">Back in the day, The Splatters would have probably made for a decent little $5 amusement. $10 is a bit too steep a price for a puzzle game as rooted in antiquity as The Splatters. Maybe wait for a price drop, and a particularly empty weekend schedule to pop up, and you'll wring what fun there is to be had out of The Splatters.</p>", "deck": "Competence is the greatest achievement The Splatters manages, and that's not quite enough to justify its price.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-487/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35903/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-splatters/3030-35903/", "id": 35903, "name": "The Splatters"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-04-13 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-112254/", "id": 112254, "name": "The Splatters"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/fez-review/1900-488/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7667/2180635-wiggle_b_s.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2180635\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.50105263157895\" data-width=\"475\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7667/2180635-wiggle_b_s.gif\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2180635\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7667/2180635-wiggle_b_s.gif\"></a><figcaption>You'll find this boiler room early, but how long will it take you to figure out what it all means?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">With <a href=\"/fez/3030-24768/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-24768\">Fez</a>, you get as much out of it as you're willing to put in. That is, the game works on multiple layers. On the surface, it's a breezy little platformer that you should be able to cruise through without much difficulty. After all, there are no real enemies, and very few spots along the main path through the game that require actual skill with a controller to complete. As a result, you're given a flashy little ending and the ability to go back into the world and find anything you may have missed. But if you just collect 32 cubes and \"finish\" the game, you're barely seeing what Fez actually has to offer. And the puzzles you must solve to get everything else are occasionally inventive, often maddening, and always interesting.</p><p style=\"\">Fez is short on story and long on atmosphere. You wake up as <a href=\"/gomez/3005-9607/\" data-ref-id=\"3005-9607\">Gomez</a>, a 2D boy in a 2D world. After being granted a <a href=\"/fez-hat/3055-4942/\" data-ref-id=\"3055-4942\">fez</a> of your own, though, you gain the ability to rotate the world by 90-degrees, letting you use perspective shifts to see the world from four different angles. Typically, this means you'll climb as high as you can, see a platform that seems to be out of reach, and rotate the world until you find an orientation that closes the gap between where you are and where you want to go. It's stylish, but there isn't really anything too tricky about navigating the world. So if you're looking at Fez in hopes of finding a perspectively-minded puzzle game along the lines of <a href=\"/crush/3030-2665/\" data-ref-id=\"3030-2665\">Crush</a>, you're probably going to be disappointed. It'll probably only take a few hours to rotate the world around and collect the minimum number of cubes required to complete the game that way.</p><p style=\"\">It's the rest of Fez that makes it something special. As you dig beneath the faux-retro aesthetic, Fez reveals all sorts of hidden elements. It forces you to pay attention to everything, from the paintings in a room to the scribblings left behind on classroom chalk boards. It never comes right out and says what's what, but as you explore the world and start to recognize what you're actually seeing around you, it creates a set of magical moments. On the downside, once you've made this realization (or, more likely, once you've looked up the main secrets), the game quickly devolves into using your map to figure out which areas still have secrets in them, heading there, and quickly collecting yet another anti-cube, which is the game's main hidden item. Between regular cubes and anti-cubes, you'll find 64 cubes in the world of Fez. And to open the game's final door, you'll need them all. You'll also have to finish the game once to unlock an additional ability that's absolutely necessary if you're looking for secrets. While the uncovering of keys to the game's secrets and learning how to interpret the world around you leads to some astoundingly revelatory moments, the way the game boils down to doing the same sort of task over and over again to collect most of the hidden items is disappointing.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1618000-fez_t.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618000\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56210526315789\" data-width=\"475\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1618000-fez_t.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1618000\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10652/1618000-fez_t.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Warp gates help you hop around the world.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Exploring the world of Fez is a wonder on its own. Despite its deliberately simple look, the world has a collection of vastly different areas to explore, and I was continually surprised by the number of different-looking areas to uncover. What starts as a collection of villages in various states, each connected by a sort of core or hub quickly expands to reveal sewer systems that glow with the monochromatic flair of an original <a href=\"/game-boy/3045-3/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-3\">Game Boy</a>, an observatory, an enormous bell tower, an equally huge clock, forests, caves, and plenty of even more surprising areas that play around with deliberate glitches and other great-looking effects. There are tons of things to simply see and study in Fez. They all warrant close inspection, too, both because they're worth examining for their artistic merit and because finding the hidden secrets that lie beneath Fez's outer layer requires you to go in with sharp eyes and an even sharper mind.</p><p style=\"\">At times it seems like every single piece of Fez's world is deliberately placed in order to teach you something about the world. Picking up what Fez is putting down is something that many players may completely fail to do, and those players are likely to come away from the game feeling like it's an easy, dumb adventure with zero challenge. Consider this your chance to lord superiority over those people, whether you figure it all out on your own (which seems pretty unlikely for most folks) or consult message boards and FAQs in search of pointers in the right direction.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">While parts of Fez deal in cute, deliberate video game glitches, these are undercut by several very real issues. On multiple occasions, I've had the game simply quit back to the <a href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" data-ref-id=\"3045-20\">Xbox 360</a> dashboard without warning. Thankfully, the game auto-saves quite regularly, so I never lost much progress. It sounds like some other players are experiencing more dramatic problems, such as loops that prevent their save game from loading, and so on. Additionally, the game's frame rate often bogs down when you first load into an area, causing stuttery transitions from one zone to another as well as slowdown once you get to where you're going. Some of these problems are more crippling than others, but it all combines to make Fez feel like a product in need of some further clean-up.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1617998\" data-size=\"medium\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-ratio=\"0.56210526315789\" data-width=\"475\" style=\"width: 475px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1617998\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10652/1617998-fez_p.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Here's Gomez's place, complete with sick drum kit.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Fez really caught me by surprise. On my initial playthrough, the game was downright maddening because it was impossible to know if I should be paying attention to all the symbols and items around the world as I hunted around for enough cubes to finish the game. Then, as I started to figure out what it was actually asking me to do, I started dreading the idea of busting out graph paper and attempting to piece the mysteries together for myself. I ended up taking the coward's way out by visiting a message board or two to get me pointed in the right direction, but once I was over that initial hump, traversing the world and decoding the \"real\" world of Fez was intensely gratifying. And going to visit the puzzles that I allowed a message board to solve for me to see how the game's developers intend for you to discover this information is unlike anything you've seen in recent history. It's just the right mixture of charm and insanity. Even if you end up letting a collective of Internet sleuths guide you by the hand as you work your way through the game's cubes, anti-cubes, artifacts, and other items, Fez still somehow manages to be worth seeing, if only to marvel at how much weird work went into making what we all thought was just a retro-styled perspective-shifting puzzle game into something decidedly more mind-bending.</p>", "deck": "The weird, wonderful world of Fez operates on multiple levels, but only the people who are willing to dig all the way down to its core will come away satisfied.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-488/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24768/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/fez/3030-24768/", "id": 24768, "name": "Fez"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-04-16 10:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84776/", "id": 84776, "name": "Fez"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/trials-evolution-review/1900-489/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2183687-untitled_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183687\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1248\" style=\"width: 1248px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2183687-untitled_3.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183687\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2183687-untitled_3.png\"></a><figcaption>If you want to pop a wheelie on Stonehenge, this is your game.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">True to its name, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35566\" href=\"/trials-evolution/3030-35566/\" slug=\"trials-evolution\">Trials Evolution</a> is the biggest, baddest version yet of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-740\" href=\"/redlynx-ltd/3010-740/\" slug=\"redlynx-ltd\">RedLynx</a>'s brutally tough physics-based <a data-ref-id=\"3055-366\" href=\"/motorcycle/3055-366/\" slug=\"motorcycle\">motorbike</a> racing-platforming thing. The heart and soul of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1444\" href=\"/trials/3025-1444/\" slug=\"trials\">Trials</a> hasn't changed one bit; it's still all about forcing you through the most complicated obstacle courses you could conceivably navigate on two wheels. Considering all I really wanted after playing <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26923\" href=\"/trials-hd/3030-26923/\" slug=\"trials-hd\">Trials HD</a> was more Trials, that's a great thing. And this time, the trimmings around that core conceit are so robust and the sheer content so plentiful that it's hard to imagine Trials getting much better than this for 15 bucks.</p><p style=\"\">I won't deny frequently wanting to throw the controller at the TV while playing Trials Evolution. Come to think of it, this wouldn't be a Trials game if I <i>didn't</i> feel that way, but it's not like the game goes out of its way to maliciously abuse you. It's harsh but fair. After all, the gameplay in Trials hinges on a grounded, plausible physics model where even the slightest throttling or braking or leaning has great significance to the way your bike handles, and there's always a way to get over the most absurdly angled ramp or crazy-looking jump, even if you haven't figured it out yet. As frustrating as some of the later courses can be, there's always room for you to improve with a little more practice and a little more finesse. Blaming Trials for being too hard is like getting mad at gravity when you fall down.</p><p style=\"\">The good news for casual Trials fans or newcomers is that Evolution offers a gentler learning curve than Trials HD did, which wasted no time getting stupid hard and not offering you much else to do if you weren't interested in going really in-depth with the gameplay. There's a huge list of courses in Evolution and they're broken up sensibly, with a more gradual ramp in difficulty that's punctuated by occasional license tests which actually offer some good tutorials on how to do things like drive up an almost sheer incline. Make no mistake, there's still a point where the late-game courses get so technical that they're no longer intuitive and you have to inch your way through them slowly, failing a bunch of obstacles over and over until you master them. But by the time you get that far, there's a better chance you'll have at least some idea of how to tackle those crazy ramps and jumps without pulling out all your hair.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2183686-untitled_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183686\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1248\" style=\"width: 1248px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2183686-untitled_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183686\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2183686-untitled_2.png\"></a><figcaption>A little dirt skiing, anyone?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Other than a user-made track feature that was hamstrung by limited sorting features, the main course progression and a few wacky minigames were pretty much all there was to occupy you in Trials HD. So it's great that RedLynx has fleshed out the peripheral features so thoroughly in Evolution. The big story here is multiplayer. There's a rollicking four-player mode, ideal for talking trash, that works locally or online, where you compete through a series of rapid-fire tracks and earn points based on your time and number of faults. You can also compete through a more serious, by-the-numbers race where you only see ghost-style representations of the other players moving through the course at the same time. The game lets you rack up a bunch of money playing the single-player tracks and then buy a bunch of cosmetic gear for your rider so you can look unique when you compete, and I really appreciate that there's a straight-up color wheel that lets you colorize your outfit any way you want. More games should have that.</p><p style=\"\">The short list of minigames from Trials HD has morphed into a veritable <i>circus</i> of skill games that have you largely leaving the bikes behind so you can ski on dirt or try to fly across a long jump field by flapping a pair of makeshift wings made out of boards. Even the ones that stick to the motorbikes are pretty ridiculous; one of them suggests that your brakes are broken and challenges you to get as far as you can with the bike's throttle pushed all the way down. The skill games are a great change of pace from the more seriously technical main levels. And since every level in the game is hooked directly into leaderboards and ghost data for your friends, it's a cinch to start competing with each other for better times, even indirectly.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Evolution's expanded user-generated content features may well be its most valuable feature, after some time passes and more great levels get made. The game makes the simple but extremely necessary improvement over Trials HD of letting you view user courses made by everyone, not just people on your friends list, and there's a wide variety of ways to search for and sort new levels, with some curated by the developer and others categorized by type and rating. There's--count 'em!--<i>two</i> level editors in here, one that makes it pretty easy for almost anyone to make simple courses that hew close to Trials' obstacle-course format. Then there's the \"pro\" editor, which lets you dig so deep into the engine and game mechanics that it's capable making things like a first-person shooter and an overhead-scrolling <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16693\" href=\"/raiden/3030-16693/\" slug=\"raiden\">Raiden</a> clone (which already exist). How is it possible this game quietly shipped with <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1242\" href=\"/littlebigplanet/3025-1242/\" slug=\"littlebigplanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a> in it? It's nuts.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2183688-untitled.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183688\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1248\" style=\"width: 1248px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2183688-untitled.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2183688\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2183688-untitled.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2183688-untitled.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Right? Right?</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">This game also goes way, way over the top with the visuals in a way that Trials HD could only dream of. That game took place entirely in a pretty bland industrial warehouse sort of environment. By contrast, Evolution seems to have lost its damn mind. There's one course that takes place in a warzone, with planes dropping bombs all around you as you go, and another that seems to be set in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1683\" href=\"/stonehenge/3035-1683/\" slug=\"stonehenge\">Stonehenge</a> under a blood-red sky. The pitch-perfect tribute to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30380\" href=\"/limbo/3030-30380/\" slug=\"limbo\">Limbo</a> stands out as another memorable course, and most of the levels end with some kind of ridiculous animation that sends your rider flying into the moon or headfirst into a toilet. Something always seems to be blowing up nearby because, why not? There's a ton of variety in the art design and a general irreverence that pervades the entire game, down to the hilarious rapping about riding motorbikes that you hear when you boot the game up. It's hard not to feel some affection for a game that gets so randomly silly.</p><p style=\"\">It's also hard to stop playing Trials Evolution for very long. The action is as tight and demanding as it ever was, and this time around it's such a fully featured and attractive package that you shouldn't miss it if you have any interest in this style of game at all. It's one of the best games to hit a downloadable service in a good long while.</p>", "deck": "Evolution gives you just about everything you could want out of a Trials sequel.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-489/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35566/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/trials-evolution/3030-35566/", "id": 35566, "name": "Trials Evolution"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-04-19 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115782/", "id": 115782, "name": "Trials Evolution"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-pinball-arcade-review/1900-490/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/2167607-screenlg1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167607\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/2167607-screenlg1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167607\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/103881/2167607-screenlg1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hit the genie to start multiball!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Forget about <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5865\" href=\"/pelicans/3015-5865/\" slug=\"pelicans\">pelicans</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3780\" href=\"/fish/3015-3780/\" slug=\"fish\">fish</a> or whatever stupid animal out there is \"going extinct\" or \"can only be viewed in a <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1551\" href=\"/zoo/3035-1551/\" slug=\"zoo\">zoo</a> these days.\" The endangered species that I care about is the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-83\" href=\"/pinball/3045-83/\" slug=\"pinball\">pinball</a> machine. It wasn't even 20 years ago that you could expect to see a healthy flock of pinball machines gathering at local <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1565\" href=\"/bowling-alley/3035-1565/\" slug=\"bowling-alley\">bowling alleys</a>, laundromats, and, before their native habitat was destroyed by careless hydrofracking, <i>actual video arcades</i>. These days, the best that most of us can do is to visit virtual pinball machines via packages like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1786\" href=\"/pinball-hall-of-fame/3025-1786/\" slug=\"pinball-hall-of-fame\">Pinball Hall of Fame</a> or downloadable front-ends like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32513\" href=\"/pinball-fx2/3030-32513/\" slug=\"pinball-fx2\">Pinball FX2</a>. The Pinball Arcade from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2380\" href=\"/farsight-studios/3010-2380/\" slug=\"farsight-studios\">FarSight Studios</a> combines both of those things, taking the licensed, real-world tables from the developer's previous work on the Pinball Hall of Fame discs and bringing them to a zillion different downloadable formats, from <a data-ref-id=\"3045-143\" href=\"/playstation-network-vita/3045-143/\" slug=\"playstation-network-vita\">Vita</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"3045-123\" href=\"/android/3045-123/\" slug=\"android\">Android</a>, in an updatable package that starts with four tables and will expand to more via regular downloadable (and paid) updates. If you have ever connected with pinball, real or virtual, in the past, Pinball Arcade is quite awesome.</p><p style=\"\">On consoles, the base package goes for $10 and includes four tables: <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35197\" href=\"/tales-of-the-arabian-nights/3030-35197/\" slug=\"tales-of-the-arabian-nights\">Tales of the Arabian Nights</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35205\" href=\"/ripleys-believe-it-or-not/3030-35205/\" slug=\"ripleys-believe-it-or-not\">Ripley's Believe It or Not!</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-37977\" href=\"/black-hole/3030-37977/\" slug=\"black-hole\">Black Hole</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27346\" href=\"/theatre-of-magic/3030-27346/\" slug=\"theatre-of-magic\">Theatre of Magic</a>. These four tables are notable for presenting a good deal of variety in eras and manufacturers, representing the titans of pinball manufacturing like <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3045\" href=\"/bally-mfg-corp/3010-3045/\" slug=\"bally-mfg-corp\">Bally</a>/<a data-ref-id=\"3010-185\" href=\"/midway-games/3010-185/\" slug=\"midway-games\">Midway</a>/Williams, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-524\" href=\"/gottlieb/3010-524/\" slug=\"gottlieb\">Gottlieb</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2694\" href=\"/stern-electronics-inc/3010-2694/\" slug=\"stern-electronics-inc\">Stern</a>, the only manufacturer still creating real-world tables today. With that in mind, the developers should have a healthy number of tables to choose from for some time to come, and around a dozen additional tables have already been announced. On some platforms, like <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" slug=\"iphone\">iOS</a>, the first set of additional tables--<a data-ref-id=\"3030-33821\" href=\"/the-machine-bride-of-pinbot/3030-33821/\" slug=\"the-machine-bride-of-pinbot\">The Machine: Bride of Pin-bot</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24687\" href=\"/medieval-madness/3030-24687/\" slug=\"medieval-madness\">Medieval Madness</a>--have already appeared as a $5 bundle.</p><p style=\"\">Perhaps the most important thing in a pinball simulation is its ability to handle the physics of an actual pinball machine. Here, The Pinball Arcade does quite well. The tables feel about as fast as they should, and the action on the flippers also just feels right. The ball itself carries an appropriate amount of weight, and in multiball situations, colliding balls careen around the table with angles that feel wholly appropriate. Personally, I think it plays a better game of pinball than Pinball FX2 does, mostly because FX2's balls feel a little light, causing them to rocket off the flippers in ways that just feel a little strange.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/2167611-screenlg5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167611\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/103881/2167611-screenlg5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2167611\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/103881/2167611-screenlg5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Black Hole should be nice and dark, like this.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">But physics only really tells one side of the story. Pinball Arcade also benefits from including some very sharp table designs. Black Hole has a really neat lower playfield that lights up when you send a ball down there. Theater of Magic has a rotating magic trunk that uses magnets to steal the ball away. Tales of the Arabian Nights has a huge, spinning lamp to aim for. Ripley's, as the newest table in the lot, has a little bit of everything, from shrunken heads to an abundance of penguin noises.</p><p style=\"\">Control-wise, the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">Xbox 360</a> version lets you choose between the shoulder buttons or triggers for flipper control, both of which feel pretty natural. The analog stick makes nudging the table around pretty easy. On touch devices, like the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-121\" href=\"/ipad/3045-121/\" slug=\"ipad\">iPad</a>, you tap the lower quadrants of the screen for flippers, and your left/right nudge control can either be done by tapping the upper quadrants or by shaking the device itself, which is a neat idea that doesn't work particularly well. Overall, I found that I was in better control of the action with a gamepad, but the iOS version doesn't lag very far behind on either iPad or iPhone. For owners of \"The New iPad,\" the game takes advantage of the higher-resolution display, making table art easy to see and read. But that visual quality comes with a trade-off, because the lighting on the iOS version looks awfully flat. Black Hole doesn't look as dark as it should. The Xbox Live Arcade release presents much nicer lighting, but the visuals aren't quite as sharp as an iPad 3 is. Minor stuff, overall. It's a great-looking pinball simulator on either platform, and both offer numerous camera options that let you get a few different angles on the action.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The real tables go a long way, showcasing some expert design work and grounding The Pinball Arcade as a real-feeling document of pinball's past, right down to the sales fliers used to sell the machines to arcade operators and a bit of additional historical data. With a long list of already-confirmed tables waiting in the wings, The Pinball Arcade stands out as a great counterpart to Pinball FX2's more fantastical take, though it lacks the more prominent leaderboards and competition that make Pinball FX2 stand out. If you're into pinball, you should probably own both. But if you're like me, and you're interested in something that more closely simulates real pinball, The Pinball Arcade just barely edges out the competition.</p>", "deck": "The Pinball Arcade provides a safe virtual home for your pinball worship, complete with accurate re-creations of real tables and appropriately realistic physics.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-490/", "platforms": "iPhone, Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-36777/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-pinball-arcade/3030-36777/", "id": 36777, "name": "The Pinball Arcade"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-04-20 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115523/", "id": 115523, "name": "Pinball Arcade"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/bloodforge-review/1900-491/", "description": "<p style=\"\">There's no shortage of rip-offs in video games.

Well, for starters, the lead character's name is <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10815\" href=\"/crom/3005-10815/\" slug=\"crom\">Crom</a>. Granted, in this case, Climax isn't so much riffing on the god of Conan lore as the original Gaelic deity that Howard loosely based his god upon. Much as God of War used fixtures of Greek mythology as blade-fodder for its angry hero, Bloodforge pulls figures from pre-Christian Irish and Anglo Saxon mythology for Crom to cut his way through. Not that there's much of a history lesson here. What Climax does with these figures is even less historically relevant than God of War's various storylines. Basically, there are gods, and you hate them, so you kill all of them over the course of roughly four hours.</p><p style=\"\">The reason you hate them is nearly identical to the reason <a data-ref-id=\"3005-645\" href=\"/kratos/3005-645/\" slug=\"kratos\">Kratos</a> hated his own gods. At the outset, you're betrayed by an unseen god for unknown reasons and tricked into killing your own wife. Crom, being the shouty barbarian that he is (he shouts <i>everything</i>), immediately sets out looking for vengeance, while a mysterious and sultry witch in a totally not evil-looking mask guides him by telling him things that most certainly are true and totally won't lead to some absurdly telegraphed plot twist down the road. Certainly not.</p><p style=\"\">At least if you've played God of War, you'll know how this is all going to play out. Gods are slayed in order of least-hated to burning rage of a thousand suns, and in between you murder a gaggle of grunt soldiers and vile-looking creatures while using a few different weapon and magic types. It's literally the same formula, except employed with almost impressive levels of ineptitude and apathy toward making any of this fun.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The first problem (and there are many) is the combat. Crom has multiple weapons, but none of them are particularly pleasurable to use. The swords, hammers, and hand blades you're offered are hamstrung by sluggish-feeling combat animations that make trying to use a specific combo or maneuver all but fruitless. Of course, you don't need to use any of the combos. Just mash on the two attack buttons and periodically dodge out of the way of enemy attackers, and you'll do just fine. Unfortunately, unlike God of War, which does a decent job of masking its sometimes button-mashy combat with responsive controls and animations that make you look like a bona fide bad-ass, Bloodforge's combat is just a slog. It's not fun to look at, and it's not fun to engage with.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2188982-screenlg5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2188982\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2188982-screenlg5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2188982\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2188982-screenlg5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The effectiveness of this crossbow borders on hilarious.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The enemies you're presented with do little to alleviate this. I'm not just talking about the usual three-hit-kill grunts, but even the big guys. The giant-sized grotesqueries and more tactically minded bad guys are just as one-note as the first guys you kill in the game. Their attack patterns don't vary in the slightest, and every attack is telegraphed by a big honking animation that practically screams, \"HEY, USE THAT DODGE BUTTON BECAUSE I'M TOTALLY GOING TO ATTACK YOU NOW, OKAY?\" at you. The only thing that makes later enemies more challenging is that they take forever to kill. That's it. There is a huge difference between making an enemy tough and making an enemy a laborious chore to kill. Pretty much every bad guy in Bloodforge skews toward the laborious chore category.</p><p style=\"\">To make matters worse--or better, or both, I don't know--the combat is also just a wee bit broken. You see, in addition to blades, Crom has a crossbow he can use to nail enemies from afar. It's a bit of a chore to use, in that you have to at least be sort of facing an enemy to fire it off, but the benefit is that it never runs out of ammo. In a game that wasn't kind of awful, you'd expect your foes to be smart enough to navigate a devious plan such as, oh, I don't know, running around in a circle forever with only periodic moments to stop and shoot your crossbow until everyone is dead and you haven't taken a single hit, but in Bloodforge? Oh my goodness no. Most of these guys will just keep running around in a circle right with you, letting you shoot them over and over again until they're stunned and you can run up and deliver the final, incoherent deathblow.</p><p style=\"\">I say incoherent because Bloodforge's camera is <i>the worst</i>. This camera, not any of the in-game enemies, is your greatest foe in Bloodforge. It's bad enough when you're just running around and the camera starts bobbing back and forth behind you like it's being held by a drunken film student, but when you're actually trapped in one of those circular bad guy arenas that you can't escape until everyone's dead, just trying to keep the camera at a reasonable angle on whatever it is you're trying to kill is a severe hassle. And I'm not just talking about using the aforementioned crossbow trick. I lost complete track of Crom in the thick of a group of monsters I was trying to stab so many times that I eventually stopped keeping count. I topped out at 23.</p><p style=\"\">While the camera can shoulder a good bit of the blame for that, Bloodforge's monochromatic art style doesn't do much to differentiate what's on screen, either. Crom's sole defining feature is an animal skull he wears as a helmet. It's white-ish, which stands out a bit from the black and brown tatters he's draped in. Unfortunately, it doesn't stand out enough from the black and brown tatters <i>every other</i> character is draped in. When you're surrounded by a group, it's basically just a giant blob of black and brown with spurts of red popping up whenever something gets stabbed.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2188990-screenlg13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2188990\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/2188990-screenlg13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2188990\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2188990-screenlg13.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/39/2188990-screenlg13.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Look at the pretty color!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Even worse, you and your enemies barely stand out against the world which is, yup, you guessed it, frequently very black and/or grey. Usually each individual world will be tinged with a bit of green or blue or whatever to signify how totally different it is from the other worlds, but ultimately none of it pops. There are some decent character designs here (even if they do look ripped straight out of everything from modern <i>Conan</i> adaptations to <a data-ref-id=\"3040-47645\" href=\"/frank-miller/3040-47645/\" slug=\"frank-miller\">Frank Miller's</a> <i>300</i>), but the entire game's color scheme is just too bland to make any of its halfway decent art stand out. I get that the game's artists were probably going for a kind of bleak stylishness, but it just doesn't work.</p><p style=\"\">Look, it's not as if God of War is some wholly original property that doesn't crib from its own mechanical and narrative inspirations. But there's a difference between \"inspired by\" and \"outright stolen from.\" Bloodforge falls squarely in the latter category, and to make matters worse, it can't even craft a halfway competent action game out of the myriad things it stole from much better action games. You can cobble together all the great ideas in the world, but if you haven't got a clue what to do with them, then all you're going to end up with is a creatively bankrupt mess like Bloodforge.</p>", "deck": "Bloodforge is the half-baked XBLA God of War clone you never asked for.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-491/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35629/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bloodforge/3030-35629/", "id": 35629, "name": "Bloodforge"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2012-04-25 11:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115745/", "id": 115745, "name": "Bloodforge"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mortal-kombat-review/1900-492/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2119129-mk9vitaswipe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119129\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.48984375\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:49.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2119129-mk9vitaswipe.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2119129\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2119129-mk9vitaswipe.jpg\"></a><figcaption>See, you can tell this is for the Vita version of the game because there's a hand model involved!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3045-129\" href=\"/playstation-vita/3045-129/\" slug=\"playstation-vita\">Vita</a> version of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25042\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">Mortal Kombat</a> is the same fantastic and content-loaded fighting game that appeared on consoles about a year ago. But this portable version of the game actually has even more to do. The four characters released as downloadable add-ons for the original game are already present, and there are even more costumes to choose from. It's gone through a year of patches and balance changes, ensuring that the version of the game you're getting on day one for the Vita has been fight-tested and tournament approved. In short, if you're a Vita owner that's open to the idea of a fighting game, Mortal Kombat is an amazing value.</p><p style=\"\">I'm not going to just rehash <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25042\" href=\"/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/reviews/\" slug=\"mortal-kombat\">everything I said a year ago</a>, but 95 percent of that old review still applies here. The single-player story mode is still astoundingly deep and the challenge tower is an exciting and maddening climb. Let's talk about the differences. The Vita version gets a new challenge tower that's largely built around the Vita's touch and shake features. It's a little silly, giving you an MK-themed take on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-31054\" href=\"/fruit-ninja/3030-31054/\" slug=\"fruit-ninja\">Fruit Ninja</a>, minigames where you tap rockets with your finger before they can reach your fighter, and so on. But it's a solid change of pace that, for the most part, handles the Vita's additional control options pretty well. In fights, you can use the touch screen to perform fatalities, if you like, and you can also unleash X-ray attacks by tapping your super meter when it's full.</p><p style=\"\">If you start directly comparing the Vita version of Mortal Kombat to its console counterparts, you'll notice some cutbacks. While the frame rate is perfectly smooth during the fighting, that seems to come at the expense of some of the original game's character detail. When the game zooms in close for fatalities, win poses, or pre-fight talking (which happens all the time in the game's story mode), you'll notice that the character models look a little grungy and decidedly flatter than they did on consoles. That's obviously not the end of the world, and it's surely insane to expect a handheld to perfectly match a console, but hey, consider yourself aware of the difference. Some backgrounds look a little static, as well, but overall, it's a really nice-looking Vita game. Also, the game's online mode is limited to fights with one other player, so all the chat lobby and avatar-based spectator stuff from the other versions has been cut in favor of basic splits between ranked/unranked and one-on-one/tag battle. It appears to work just fine, though I had a few games drop out after character selection had been completed and it occasionally takes a little while to match up with a player and get a game going. Once you're connected, though, fighting and voice chat (which is on at all times once you're connected) work great.</p><p style=\"\">Even if you're not near a Wi-Fi connection often enough to take advantage of the multiplayer side of Mortal Kombat, there's more than enough stuff for you to do by yourself to make it worth its $40 price tag. If you're at all warm to the idea of a portable fighting game, you should absolutely pick it up.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p>", "deck": "The Vita version of Mortal Kombat hits just as hard as its console counterparts.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-492/", "platforms": null, "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25042/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mortal-kombat/3030-25042/", "id": 25042, "name": "Mortal Kombat"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2012-05-01 20:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/minecraft-review/1900-493/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2202934-screenshot8.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2202934\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2202934-screenshot8.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2202934\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2202934-screenshot8.png\"></a><figcaption>Enough hours and elbow grease will turn this...</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's hard to imagine you've kept up with video games this long without becoming at least passingly familiar with the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30475\" href=\"/minecraft/3030-30475/\" slug=\"minecraft\">Minecraft</a> phenomenon. But if you're like me, so far you've managed to avoid actually diving pickaxe-first into that blocky landscape and wasting dozens of hours building... whatever it is a person builds when they have access to a wide range of tools and no specific directives as to their use. For you and me, the new Xbox 360 Edition of Minecraft is a fine introduction to the world of tunneling to the center of the Earth in a desperate search for precious minerals, and constructing castles that take you weeks to build. Veterans of the far more robust PC version, however, more than likely won't find anything worthwhile in this scaled-down port.</p><p style=\"\">If you don't actually know anything about what Minecraft is at this point, there are untold thousands of hours of YouTube videos out there to educate you. Let it suffice that it's a retro-lookin' open-ended <a data-ref-id=\"3015-453\" href=\"/sandbox/3015-453/\" slug=\"sandbox\">sandbox</a> where you harvest raw materials like dirt, wood, and stone, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-934\" href=\"/crafting/3015-934/\" slug=\"crafting\">refine</a> them into slightly less raw materials like glass, and then... well, you figure it out. As this was my first experience in any sort of Minecraft world whatsoever, I was terrified by the game's lack of direction for a couple of hours, until I finally decided that I was going to build myself a gigantic castle, which ended up presenting a series of small architectural and process-oriented challenges that I found pretty satisfying. This version does include a nicely paced (if poorly written) tutorial that smoothly introduces you to the steps required to make basic tools, build structures, and so on. It's also a rare case where the included Xbox achievements actually provide you some specific structure and guidance above and beyond the goals the game itself gives you, which are few.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2202931-screenshot4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2202931\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2202931-screenshot4.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2202931\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2202931-screenshot4.png\"></a><figcaption>...into something more like this.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">That said, this \"Xbox 360 Edition\" is a strange beast that comes with what seems like an equal number of pros and cons when compared to the PC original. In the negative column: individual worlds are quite limited in size, considering the PC version will generate endless terrain for as long as you want to explore it. There's also no option for a persistent world that anyone can join at will; instead, the host has to be running their game and have it set to \"online\" for anyone else to join it, and all other players are dropped when the host quits. Naturally, you won't have access to any of the legion of mods that have been produced for the game. And most damningly, the 360 game is based on a year-old PC version that lacks a huge list of features like a hunger meter, new biomes, and randomly generated towns. The developers of this version hope to expedite Microsoft's typically onerous update process and bring it closer to parity with the PC game on a bimonthly basis, but whether or not that will happen--and whether they'll charge extra if it does--remains to be seen. The short version of all this is that if you've already spent a ton of time with the \"real\" Minecraft, or you want to delve straight into the most mature and feature-rich version of the game on the market, this isn't the one you want.</p><p style=\"\">The 360 game isn't without its own improvements, though. Chiefly, the crafting interface is fast and largely automated, presenting you with an easy-to-browse list of recipes and allowing you to pop out axes and shovels, stairs, workbenches, and so on at the touch of a button, rather than forcing you to memorize ingredient lists and manually drag those ingredients into slots to make stuff. And while the persistence of your worlds is limited, the game offers an elegant way to view and join all of your friends' games while they're in progress. Most importantly, the game offers local splitscreen co-op that makes it an ideal casual experience for multiple people hanging around the house on a lazy Saturday afternoon. For me, the local co-op rapidly went from a mere bullet-point feature to the most valuable aspect of this whole game in the space of one of those afternoons. The game works really well on the 360 controller in general, and if you use the lowest difficulty, which disables monsters (like the infernal <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5979\" href=\"/creeper/3015-5979/\" slug=\"creeper\">creepers</a> who are constantly blowing up all your carefully constructed stuff), the game can be an awfully pleasant, lean-back sort of way to pass a few hours. Or more than a few.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2202929-screenshot2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2202929\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2202929-screenshot2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2202929\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2202929-screenshot2.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2202929-screenshot2.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The worlds are limited in size, but still plenty big to build some dumb stuff in.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In the multitude of hours I've put into this version of Minecraft so far, I had no trouble editing multiple worlds across multiple Xboxes, and playing any combination of local and online co-op with various friends. Though, there was one maddening experience where the game crashed when I used the save-and-quit option, failing to save in the process and obliterating all my work since the last save. Based on anecdotal evidence, I'm hardly the only one who's had that specific problem, so you're advised to use the regular manual save option frequently to make sure you don't lose any hard work until the game is patched.</p><p style=\"\">In the future, this version of the game will live and die by the frequency and robustness of those promised updates and the extent to which they catch the game up to the progress of the PC original. The 360 Edition is a bit steep by Xbox standards at $20, though the PC version now costs a bit more (and <a href=\"/minecraft/3030-30475/forums/minecraft-xbla-only-15-from-best-buy-at-launch-546283/\">some outlets</a> seem to be selling this one for less, anyway).

Rockstar, of course, addresses both of these issues with no small amount of its own usual panache, discarding large swaths of Max\u2019s established aesthetic and asserting its own set of influences in the process.</p><p style=\"\">Rockstar held publishing duties on the first two Max Payne games, but <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23398\" href=\"/max-payne-3/3030-23398/\" slug=\"max-payne-3\">Max Payne 3</a> really <i>feels</i> like a modern Rockstar game, with the grimy creative fingerprints of the creators of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20457\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto-iv\">Grand Theft Auto IV</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25249\" href=\"/red-dead-redemption/3030-25249/\" slug=\"red-dead-redemption\">Red Dead Redemption</a> all over it. To trot out a hoary old line that <a data-ref-id=\"3005-697\" href=\"/max-payne/3005-697/\" slug=\"max-payne\">Max Payne</a> himself would probably mutter to himself and then sneer at, this ain\u2019t your grandaddy\u2019s Max Payne. And in a way, that\u2019s kind of a shame, since there hasn\u2019t really been anything quite like Max Payne <i>since</i> Max Payne. Max Payne 3 is definitely a different kind of cocktail, but it still packs a pretty good wallop.</p><p style=\"\">Even for Max, a lot of time has passed since <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3547\" href=\"/max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne/3030-3547/\" slug=\"max-payne-2-the-fall-of-max-payne\">Max Payne 2: The Fall of Max Payne</a>, to the point that the dramatic, traumatic events of the first two games are little more than old scar tissue now. Having long since ruined anything worth ruining in New York with <a data-ref-id=\"3055-698\" href=\"/alcoholic-beverages/3055-698/\" slug=\"alcoholic-beverages\">booze</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-218\" href=\"/pills/3055-218/\" slug=\"pills\">pills</a>, Max has retreated from his own life and taken up reluctant employment as a personal bodyguard for the wealthy, powerful, and treacherous Branco family in S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil. For as comfortably as Max and his black jacket fit into the shadows of New York\u2019s underworld, he\u2019s a stranger in a strange land here. His leathery American frame sticks out like a sore thumb in the washed-out sunlight of both S\u00e3o Paulo\u2019s rich playgrounds of privilege and its rusted favelas, which he fumbles through with as little grasp on the local language as to why he\u2019s <i>really</i> in S\u00e3o Paulo. Max has never been a particularly sunny soul, but here he regards his idle rich clients with about as much simmering contempt as he does for his own half-drunk, careless ineptitude as family members get kidnapped and his bad situation continues to find new ways to get worse.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/2205623-rsg_mp3_290.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2205623\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/2205623-rsg_mp3_290.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2205623\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/2205623-rsg_mp3_290.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Max on Fire.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Rockstar has never been particularly shy about its specific influences, which are often cinematic in origin. With Max Payne 3, the setting, character situations, and overall look of the game make comparisons to the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-16754\" href=\"/tony-scott/3005-16754/\" slug=\"tony-scott\">Tony Scott</a> movie <i>Man on Fire</i> inevitable, and apt, though there are strains of director <a data-ref-id=\"3040-3659\" href=\"/michael-mann/3040-3659/\" slug=\"michael-mann\">Michael Mann\u2019s</a> slick latter-day crime dramas in there as well, all of it spiked with a spare synthesizer score and shocking moments of extreme violence. Though it\u2019s not couched in the caricatured satire of GTAIV or the bleak revisionist period trappings of Red Dead, that same authorial voice still rings like a gunshot.</p><p style=\"\">There\u2019s still plenty of internal monologue from Max, but like the rest of the game, the language is less flowery and more nihilistic than Remedy\u2019s work with the character. It\u2019s still every bit as stylish, but in a completely different way, replacing Max\u2019s old static comic-panel storytelling devices with flashy multi-frame cutscenes that are jumpy and dynamic, often popping up key bits of dialogue on screen for added punch. It\u2019s a distinct look and feel that, in some ways, reminded me more of the blown-out neon and cheap digital noise of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3562\" href=\"/io-interactive/3010-3562/\" slug=\"io-interactive\">IO Interactive\u2019s</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26394\" href=\"/kane-lynch-2-dog-days/3030-26394/\" slug=\"kane-lynch-2-dog-days\">Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days</a> than the previous Max Payne games, but there are times that it overindulges in its own sense of style, distracting from the plot\u2019s serpentine double-crossing and Max\u2019s near-constant self-flagellation.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Max may be greyer at the temples than when we last left him, and far more emotionally handicapped by drink and drugs, but he\u2019s no less capable than he ever was when leaping through the air in slow-motion with a pair of guns while facing down armies of thugs, crooked cops, and worse. Tapping into Max\u2019s hallmark ability to drop the action into slow-motion for fleeting moments of time is still fundamental to the game\u2019s third-person gunplay, and he still relies on found painkillers to manage his health--a grim fact he\u2019ll regularly make glib reference to--but both have been tweaked in significant ways.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/2205624-rsg_mp3_295.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2205624\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/2205624-rsg_mp3_295.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2205624\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/2205624-rsg_mp3_295.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/2205624-rsg_mp3_295.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>When nothing else makes sense, open fire.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">There\u2019s no on-screen indication other than the silhouetted life meter in the corner of the screen to let you know when Max is near death--a point that feels oddly archaic--though should you take one too many bullets, you can cheat that last gasp by targeting the enemy that got you, provided you\u2019re holding onto at least one painkiller. Max\u2019s basic shoot-dodging abilities remain intact, though now when you clear a room of enemies, you\u2019re given the opportunity to continue pumping the last man standing full of lead for no apparent reasons beyond gory style and a vicious vindictiveness. The experience is also punctuated throughout with orchestrated slow-mo gameplay set-pieces that usually involve Max leaping through the air while killing as many men as possible.</p><p style=\"\">In bringing the action of Max Payne into 2012, the addition of a cover mechanic is perhaps both the most subtle and significant change in Max Payne 3. Being able to slide into cover to control the tempo of the action is almost a given in a post-<a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears-of-War</a> third-person shooter. Combining that with Max\u2019s literal ability to control the tempo by slowing down time might make him seem invincible. Instead, Max is made more fragile to make up the difference, a choice that makes it more challenging to use the slow-mo in a cool, stylish way and undercuts one of the fundamental things that has defined Max Payne in the past. Aside from the addition of some hard- and soft-lock targeting options, the actual gunplay doesn't feel too radically different, and yet for all of the chaos around you, it's an experience that feels much more controlled.</p><p style=\"\">As in GTAIV and Red Dead Redemption, Max Payne 3 features a competitive multiplayer mode that runs parallel to the single-player; it takes place in the same world, with familiar locations and players, but it\u2019s a very different experience. You can trigger the slow-motion effect in multiplayer, and though it\u2019s in more limited quantities than in the single-player, it has the added impact of affecting everyone in the game. Beyond that ability, though, there are few surprises to be had in the multiplayer. There are deathmatch and team deathmatch variants, as well as an objective-based Gang War mode, and you\u2019ll earn money and experience that you can use to unlock new weapons, gear, and abilities. Adding to the persistent side of the multiplayer, you can choose to join a crew, which can provide additional bonuses. It\u2019s all pretty well thought-out as far as these types of modes go, but it feels kind of common, watering down the elements that make Max Payne cool.</p><p style=\"\">Rockstar has taken a lot of risks in the ways it has reshaped the series with Max Payne 3, and there\u2019s something to be said for opting out of the easy route. The aesthetic overhaul is certainly the most noticeable, though there's no understating the impact that certain gameplay modernizations have had on the experience. While fans might have a hard time processing the dramatic change in tone, it\u2019s approached with a seriousness and conviction that I respect, and frankly, have come to expect from Rockstar.</p>", "deck": "Rockstar Games modernizes and makes Max Payne its own, creating something grittier and more grounded in reality, if not quite as singular.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-494/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23398/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/max-payne-3/3030-23398/", "id": 23398, "name": "Max Payne 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-05-14 09:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84337/", "id": 84337, "name": "Max Payne 3"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/diablo-iii-review/1900-495/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2006288-wizard_casting_shock_pulse_modified_by_indigo_runestone_3_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2006288\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56272727272727\" data-width=\"2200\" style=\"width: 2200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2006288-wizard_casting_shock_pulse_modified_by_indigo_runestone_3_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2006288\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2006288-wizard_casting_shock_pulse_modified_by_indigo_runestone_3_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Action-RPG combat has rarely ever been this addictive.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3010-1088\" href=\"/blizzard-entertainment/3010-1088/\" slug=\"blizzard-entertainment\">Blizzard</a> made no attempt to reinvent the wheel a couple of years ago when it revitalized <a data-ref-id=\"3025-326\" href=\"/starcraft/3025-326/\" slug=\"starcraft\">StarCraft</a> after its decade-long absence, choosing instead to simply modernize and spit-polish that franchise's well-known fundamentals until they reached the company's trademark high-gloss sheen. They've taken the same tack in reviving <a data-ref-id=\"3025-148\" href=\"/diablo/3025-148/\" slug=\"diablo\">Diablo</a> after its own 12-year hiatus, and once again the result hews to the nostalgic strengths of its antique predecessors while also managing to feel like it belongs on a release list in 2012. And it's a hell of a lot of fun to play, with hooks that <i>keep</i> you playing longer in one sitting than you might have wanted to. I'm not the type to often play through a game more than once, so I guess it's saying something that after more than 35 hours with the game--first playing all the way through with my primary character, then playing through a bunch of it <i>again</i> on the next difficulty, jumping into numerous dungeon runs with friends, and dabbling with several other classes (all of whom I'd love, time permitting, to take to high levels themselves)--I really just want to keep playing more <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20803\" href=\"/diablo-iii/3030-20803/\" slug=\"diablo-iii\">Diablo III</a>.</p><p style=\"\">This new game's staunch adherence to its loot-driven action-RPG conventions might tell you right off the bat if you should even be interested or not. Do you like loot? Not just a little bit of loot, but ubiquitous, shiny, delicious, stat-increasing loot everywhere you look? Just like its predecessors--and perhaps even more so than them--Diablo III is a game about constantly building and rebuilding your character with new gear and abilities to meet the challenges that are constantly increasing in front of you. It's also a game where the extent of your interaction with the world entails clicking to move, and clicking and tapping some number keys to kill everything in front of you. You play it entirely from a fixed overhead camera angle, and the story, aside from a handful of lavish CG cutscenes, plays out exclusively through small character models gesticulating a bit while their dialogue comes out of speech bubbles. In short, it rigidly assumes the form and structure of the old Diablo games, so if you already know you're burned out on that specific formula, you may move along.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/108949/2147072-diablo_iii_2012_03_04_20_21_56_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2147072\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/10/108949/2147072-diablo_iii_2012_03_04_20_21_56_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2147072\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/10/108949/2147072-diablo_iii_2012_03_04_20_21_56_03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The social features get you playing with your friends easily... you know, if you have any.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If that sort of game does it for you--and there are plenty of you out there--you'd have a tough time finding one that's better put-together than Diablo III. A game where you spend 98 percent of your time killing stuff (and the remaining time performing upkeep on your ability to kill stuff) would get old pretty fast if the combat weren't a ton of fun, so it's a good thing Diablo III's is. I think it's the hardest-hitting I've ever seen in the genre. There's something about the interactions between your fighter and enemies, the visual and sound cues that go along with every strike, that just makes the combat feel, for lack of a better word, <i>right</i>. So often you feel like an unstoppable whirlwind of destruction when you wade into a dozen or more enemies and juggle your skills back and forth to control the crowd, focus down a single tough elite monster, or kite a bunch of enemies around as you frantically try to heal. The action is just tightly designed in a way that seems like a lot of designers spent a lot of time tuning it to perfection. Fighting enemies in this game never gets old, which is a good thing since finishing the story once sends you straight back to the menu with an urging to begin again on the next difficulty, where the loot is much better and the enemies don't just hit harder but also change up their tactics, forcing you to change up yours. I can't stress enough how enjoyable it is to keep playing after you see the credits the first time.</p><p style=\"\">The game's classes cover all the bases you'd want, from the pure burly melee of the barbarian to nimble and arcane DPS courtesy of the demon hunter and wizard, respectively, to the horde of sinister pets that accompany the witch doctor into battle. My personal favorite, the monk, is like a martial paladin who can effectively heal up in between roundhouse kicks and a blur of fist strikes. Each class' skills are split across a variety of categories, and almost every skill has a long list of \"runes\" you pick from to add some ancillary effect that further differentiates them. The breakdown of skills into those different categories initially seems constraining, but there's actually a dizzying number of ways to build the skills of a given class to fit different play styles and challenges. Why the game hides the full ability to mix and match your skills behind the optional \"elective mode\" checkbox in the options, however, is completely baffling to me. Elective mode is absolutely essential to getting the most out of the game's combat, so it's a shame there isn't some tutorial tip that goes out of its way to let you know how much freedom to customize you actually have. Once you click that single checkbox, the gameplay really opens up.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/1853679-diablo_iii_beta_monk_taking_care_of_business.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1853679\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56272727272727\" data-width=\"2200\" style=\"width: 2200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/1853679-diablo_iii_beta_monk_taking_care_of_business.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1853679\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10005/1853679-diablo_iii_beta_monk_taking_care_of_business.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10005/1853679-diablo_iii_beta_monk_taking_care_of_business.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Seriously, play a monk.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If this were purely a combat game, I guess it could be conducted with stick figures and primary colors, but of course it's worth addressing the world and story Blizzard built up to propel your loot grind along. The plot proceeds with equal parts gravitas and cheese, about like you'd expect from a story about a literal war between heaven and hell, but that setup does make for some truly epic, screen-filling boss encounters and sieges for you to fight your way through. It's also fun to revisit some memorable old locations like <a data-ref-id=\"3035-499\" href=\"/tristram/3035-499/\" slug=\"tristram\">Tristram</a> (which comes with just a hint of the discordant acoustic guitar that practically defined that first game) and catch up on the continuing events of familiar characters like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-545\" href=\"/deckard-cain/3005-545/\" slug=\"deckard-cain\">Deckard Cain</a> and the skeleton king <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9993\" href=\"/king-leoric/3005-9993/\" slug=\"king-leoric\">Leoric</a>. Much more impressive is the expertly considered art design that bathes the game in exquisite detail and makes excellent use of color choice and lighting to create unique mood specific to each location. Don't think that the tiny character models and bird's-eye view of the action somehow make this game outdated from a visual standpoint. The art is so strong that each scene takes on a painterly effect that almost transcends its polygonal makeup, and I kept noticing how much detail was crammed into the periphery of each map, like a collapsed bridge here or some old statuary there, in places you can't even explore. There's a liberal use of ambient animations, like birds flying at the camera or old architecture crumbling when you run by, that make the environments feel more lively, and the game's excellent use of ragdoll to send enemies flying over ledges or into the water is always amusing.</p><p style=\"\">But again, it's about the loot, and how much fun the fighting is that gets you more of it. The game changes dramatically when you join up with other players, since the monsters get harder and you're able to settle into a more specialized role while other classes cover their own roles, allowing you to change up the way you play and what combination of skills you're using. The game isn't incredibly difficult your first time through, but I found it doled out new equipment and better drops at a good, steady pace as I got a handle on all the things my class could do, so that by the time the next difficulty rolled around, I was jumping at the chance to get in there with some friends and explore a range of new combat possibilities under much greater duress. It's when three or four high-level players are all in there doing their thing at once, with the action devolving into a high-speed orgy of colored lights and particle effects, that Diablo III is at its best. The game makes the elegant choice of distributing separate loot to each player, so you don't have to worry about some jerk grabbing the spaulders or daibo you wanted, but so far I've found there to be a nice spirit of sharing among all the players I've played with as we pass loot around that suits other people's classes.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/2148146-ah_selling_ui.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2148146\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.67258064516129\" data-width=\"1240\" style=\"width: 1240px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/10005/2148146-ah_selling_ui.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2148146\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10005/2148146-ah_selling_ui.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/10005/2148146-ah_selling_ui.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The auction house is certainly capable of saving you some time.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's too early to say what eventual impact the game's persistent auction house will have on Diablo III's economy and the value of rare items, especially since Blizzard hasn't rolled out the ability to sell stuff for actual dollars yet. It's safe to say that launch will have a profound effect on the way items are bought and sold, but even now the transactions being conducted with gold are providing an interesting case study in the ebb and flow of in-game economics. It's been amusing to see comparable items being listed right next to each other with an order of magnitude disparity in their pricing, leading me to believe some players are listing items as high as they can to see what they can get away with, or others are trying to sell gear without knowing the value of what they actually have, or both. Who can even say what the absolute value is of a one-handed sword with 100 damage per second and a bonus to attack speed? More practically, the game's auction house gives you so much control over search filtering that it's almost embarrassingly easy to specify the exact type of weapon or armor you're looking for, the level range, the stats you want, and exactly how much you're willing to pay for it. At the moment, there are enough people selling great loot at bargain-basement prices that too much time in the auction house can sort of trivialize the gear you find in the game itself. Whether that's a problem for you probably comes down to personal preference, and given that the auction house exists only at the game's main menu, it's easy enough to ignore if you want to maintain some sort of loot-lust purity as you make your way through. If you don't have a ton of time to grind through dungeon runs in an endless search for more loot, though, it can be a real time-saver.</p><p style=\"\">Speaking of multiplayer and that auction house, you could scarcely know about Diablo III at all without having heard about the game's always-online connectivity that requires you to be constantly in touch with Blizzard's servers to play it at all, even by yourself. That approach to maintaining the sanctity of the in-game economy (and making sure a bunch of people don't hack and/or pirate the game) comes with plenty of ups and downs. On the upside, the level of integrated connectedness is pretty impressive, letting you chat with friends while you're playing alone, seamlessly invite them into your game or join theirs whenever you feel like it, and even inspect their characters and see their achievements popping up in real time. On the downside...if you can't connect to Battle.net, you can't play the game, no matter whether you want to play it with other people or not. That has real, unfortunate consequences when Blizzard doesn't have its act together, as evidenced by the calamity that ensued in the first 36 hours of release when I frequently had a hard time getting into the game at all, and latency-related issues messed with performance and booted me out a couple of times.

Martin's <i>A Song of Ice and Fire</i> series of fantasy novels, which you may be a tad more aware of these days thanks to the hit HBO series <i>Game of Thrones</i>. Beyond those facets, there is also a wry sense of gallows humor to Martin's writing that takes a bit of the poisonous edge off of what is generally a deeply unsentimental story full of people you might possibly like generally getting fucked over again and again until they either end up dead, raped, otherwise bloodied, or some combination of the three.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2191117-gameofthrones_27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2191117\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2191117-gameofthrones_27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2191117\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2191117-gameofthrones_27.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A lot of terrible things are going to happen to Alester over the next 20 or so hours.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's this sense of humor that is altogether absent from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-36886\" href=\"/game-of-thrones/3030-36886/\" slug=\"game-of-thrones\">Game of Thrones</a>, developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1126\" href=\"/cyanide-studio/3010-1126/\" slug=\"cyanide-studio\">Cyanide Studio's</a> detailed, if somewhat misguided attempt at turning Martin's fiction into a palatable role-playing experience. Taking mechanics largely inspired by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-98\" href=\"/bioware/3010-98/\" slug=\"bioware\">BioWare's</a> various RPGs and combining them with selected story elements of Martin's first <i>Ice and Fire</i> novel (and by proxy, the first season of the TV series), Game of Thrones has no shortage of aspirations. Unfortunately, Cyanide wildly overreaches beyond its apparent capabilities, turning in a depressingly lackluster effort that is a mere skeleton of its potential.</p><p style=\"\">Before we go any further, know that you can play Game of Thrones sans any foreknowledge of the books or the TV series, but it's far from recommended. Cyanide has constructed a game that is absolutely rich in subtle and obscure details from Martin's books. The stories of Game of Thrones are self-contained, but for newcomers, many of the references and concepts tossed around by the characters and codices of the game are bound to go well over your head.</p><p style=\"\">Those self-contained stories tell the concurrent tales of Mors Westford and Alester Sarwyck, two characters previously unknown to the world of Westeros. Mors is an almost comically grizzled ranger with the Night's Watch, the black-clad guardians of the massive, perpetually iced-over wall that separates the Seven Kingdoms from the barbaric mountain regions on the other side. Sarwyck is a former heir to the Lordship of Riverspring, a territory invented wholesale for the purposes of this game. After spending 15 years in the Free Cities of the eastern continent, Alester returns as a Red Priest of R'hllor to pay his last respects to his recently-deceased father, who may have died under suspicious circumstances.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The set up and narrative structure of the game is one of the things Cyanide nails, insomuch as it feels very similar to the way Martin tells his stories. The game moves back and forth between Mors and Alester's lives as they unknowingly investigate opposing sides of a mystery, which pertains to a strange woman being hunted by rival houses and even Queen Cersei herself. Eventually these two stories do converge, and do so in an intelligent way that genuinely qualifies as a very cool and cathartic moment in a game that tragically has precious few of them.</p><p style=\"\">It's not that Game of Thrones lacks the grotesque violence or the heartbreaking double-crosses or the abject misery generally experienced by Martin's characters; it's that there isn't really much else beyond those things. Growing attached to any one character probably isn't a good idea, because the writers of this game are even more capricious about killing them off than Martin is himself. As for Mors and Alester, neither is exactly a cheery fellow. Alester's emotions range between forlorn and sleepy, while Mors is such a coarse and uninviting creature that just being around him can feel like a slow, agonizing suicide by sandpaper. And they both suffer indignity after indignity as the game goes along, to the point where you start to wish it would just <i>end</i>, already, if only to spare them some needless suffering. By the end of Game of Thrones, you'll think Ned Stark got off comparatively easy.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2078650-gameofthrones_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2078650\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2078650-gameofthrones_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2078650\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2078650-gameofthrones_02.jpg\"></a><figcaption>A lot of terrible things are going to happen to Mors, too. But at least he has a dog.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">With all this misery and skulduggery and relentless stabbing comes none of the wit inherent to the books and the TV show. The <i>Game of Thrones</i> TV series works especially well because there are so many clever personalities so brilliantly portrayed by actors like Peter Dinklage, Charles Dance, Maisie Williams, and the like. Those personalities are essentially absent in this game. Major characters like Tyrion Lannister, Littlefinger, and anyone from the Stark or Baratheon clans are nowhere to be found, and the supplemental characters created for the game aren't suitable replacements. Lord Varys, the bald-headed eunuch and master of spies is on hand (and voiced by TV series actor Conleth Hill), but his scenes lack any of the witty repartee he's so well known for on the show and in the books.</p><p style=\"\">From the TV cast, he is joined only by James Cosmo, the actor who plays Night's Watch commander Jeor Mormont. Sadly, Cosmo's performance is brought down by the same trap that snags pretty much every other voice actor in this thing: the script. Game of Thrones is an exceptionally wordy game, filled with long-winded strings of purple dialogue that has no right coming out of a human mouth, even in this high fantasy world. The actors struggle endlessly to try and emote these needlessly engorged strings of expository text into something that sounds vaguely human, but it never quite works.</p><p style=\"\">Regrettably, dialogue dominates much of Game of Thrones' progression. In gameplay, Cyanide has implemented elements of player choice into the dialogue, which can have distinct effects on how later sections of the game play out. The choices you're presented with are generally interesting ones, but the problem is that they're sandwiched between lengthy sections where you're just listening to characters explain to one another the stuff that you just saw happen five minutes ago. You can, thankfully, skip most dialogue sequences, but you're going to be hitting that skip button a lot before you get to the next mission.</p><p style=\"\">The tech and art that make up the foundation of Game of Thrones do little to make up for these shortcomings. Game of Thrones is not an attractive game, even by the admittedly bleak standards set by the show's depiction of the world. Characters are stiffly animated and poorly rendered, environments are bland, blurry, and blocky, and at no point do characters engaged in combat look like they're even aware of one another, let alone actually engaging one another.</p><p style=\"\">It's a shame, because the combat and character-building systems as designed aren't half-bad; they're just not executed particularly well. At the outset of the game, you choose from one of three different combat stances that each character will use throughout the game, which determine your proficiency in different weapon types. Additionally, you'll have to choose equivalent strengths and weaknesses. Strengths are the expected stuff, like leadership bonuses that help rally your party members, or agility bonuses that make you more nimble in combat. Weaknesses, however, drag down your abilities a bit. For instance, you might choose the hemophiliac weakness, which causes you to bleed (and thus lose more hit points) during combat, or you might have a fear of fire that makes you more susceptible to fire damage.</p><p style=\"\">It's a neat little balancing act that sadly is rendered less-than-thrilling by the dearth of interesting abilities you're afforded. You'll gain new attacks and abilities at a reasonably rapid clip, but only a handful of them are particularly useful in battle. This essentially means you'll find yourself spamming the same three or four attacks through every single combat sequence, a fact made all the more tedious by the general lack of enemy variety in front of you. Sometimes the combat challenge level will violently spike, but it's not because you're fighting new or more interesting characters. I hope you enjoy killing dumb guys with swords, bigger dumb guys with swords, and <i>really</i> dumb archers (they clearly don't understand the concept of \"ranged\" attacks), because that's about all you're going to get.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2191118-gameofthrones_28.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2191118\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2191118-gameofthrones_28.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2191118\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2191118-gameofthrones_28.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2191118-gameofthrones_28.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Combat tends to devolve into a mess of repetitive attacks and lazy, flailing animations.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Mors and Alester each have their own character-specific abilities as well: Alester's priestly powers give him control over fire magic, while Mors is a skinchanger, meaning he can enter the mind of his trusty dog, whom Mors hasn't even bothered to give a name. The fire magic stuff adds a bit of depth to Alester's combat sequences, but it's ultimately unneeded depth, since again, the same few attacks are easily relied upon for the duration. In addition to being able to send the dog after attackers, skinchanging gives Mors an extra stealth ability, since the dog is less noticeable and can sneak through smaller spaces. Unfortunately, the dog sections tend to drag on far longer than is fun, especially when you end up doing the same button-mashing minigame every single time you want to murder someone quietly.</p><p style=\"\">That's pretty much the whole of Game of Thrones. Sad dialogue, combat, sad dialogue, combat, sad dialogue, more sad dialogue, something outright horrifying happening, sad combat, and so on repeated in varying orders for a bit more than 20 hours. I'll admit that as a fan of the source material, I did find myself increasingly willing to put up with Game of Thrones' mediocre mechanics and ass-ugly graphics for the sake of pushing forward in the story. At points, its tale can be quite gripping. But between its healthy dollops of bloated dialogue, its endlessly embittered tone, and its perhaps unsurprisingly bleak conclusion--no matter which of the multiple endings you end up with, mind you--I ultimately found Game of Thrones too soul-draining to enjoy. There is fan service to be had here, but the trade-off of what you have to endure to experience it isn't balanced in your favor.</p>", "deck": "There is probably a great role-playing game to be made out of George R.R.

Once it gets rolling, it's pretty fun to lay waste to everything around you as you unlock arm swords, arm whips, claw arms, and so on. But once you get most of the powers and move into the game's back third, it turns into a monotonous chore. I had unlocked almost all of the meaningful upgrades, and all that remained was to trudge through the remaining story missions to see how the story ends. But the story in Prototype 2 is filled with one lame character after another, making Prototype 2 a much better game when it just shuts up and lets you break stuff.</p><p style=\"\">This sequel flips the original game on its head by making the protagonist of the original, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3056\" href=\"/alex-mercer/3005-3056/\" slug=\"alex-mercer\">Alex Mercer</a>, the bad guy here. At the opening, Mercer infects your soldier with his crazy virus, giving you the same abilities Mercer had in the original game, such as gliding and air dashing, which makes floating around the city pretty easy. You can also run up the sides of buildings, pick up cars, and all sorts of other superhero-style stuff. The thing that gives Prototype its hook, though, is the way you can \"consume\" other humans and steal their shape. This gives the game an occasional stealth edge, as you'll sometimes need to consume the commander of a base and assume his identity to make your way past locked doors and such. The game won't let you eat people in front of other people without causing a full alert, so you'll either need to take out the enemies that are looking in your direction--which the game helpfully points out--or just cause an alert, eat your target, then run away until the alert dies down. You can swap between your real form and the most recent person you've eaten at will, and switching when enemy troops aren't looking in your direction cancels that alert status almost immediately. So the stealth side of Prototype 2 is light, at best.</p><p style=\"\">The backdrop for your cannibalism is a quarantined <a data-ref-id=\"3035-109\" href=\"/new-york-city/3035-109/\" slug=\"new-york-city\">New York City</a>, which has plenty of regular civilians around mixed in with evil military guys, even-eviler Blackwatch troopers, monsters caused by the infection, and a group of \"Evolved\" humans that are just like you... but <i>evil</i>. Each enemy requires slightly different tactics at first, but as you level up and unlock new abilities and complete side tasks to get bonus mutations, the opposition isn't a significant threat. Enemies that originally require you to dodge or counter their attacks early on in the game are defeated by simple button mashing later on. While that ties in nicely with the way your XP is constantly giving you more and more power, it makes the back third or so of the game feel like a formality, from a gameplay perspective.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1987859-prototype2redzone3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1987859\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.67109375\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:67.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/1987859-prototype2redzone3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1987859\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/1987859-prototype2redzone3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Some of the enemies you encounter are decidedly less than human.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">So much of Prototype 2 and your enjoyment of it hinges on you enjoying the way Heller moves. As with Mercer in the previous game, Heller can run up the sides of buildings, glide, and air dash his way around New York, and upgrades you earn along the way make all of those things work better, as well. Combining your various movement abilities to quickly get around the city is probably the best part of Prototype 2, but it still has some clunky moments, like the way Heller seems to want to run upside-down whenever you're dashing up the side of a building with an awning. When you're attempting to complete one of the game's time-based challenge missions, those little glitches become pretty frustrating. But you'll only run into a few of those if you stick to the main path.</p><p style=\"\">Sticking to the story path will get you through the game faster, but you'll miss some of the cooler upgrades. In addition to earning experience points and leveling up, completing sets of side missions gives you access to various mutations that can alter your character in some interesting ways. One, for example, lets you simply ignore all hits from small arms fire. When bullets just bounce off of you, you can focus on the larger threats, like the big mutant beasts that want to rip you in half, tanks, choppers, or dudes with rocket launchers. Other mutations give you more mobility, and so on. The side missions also tie into the old \"Web of Deceit\" concept from the first game, where you hunt around the city for specific individuals and consume them. This gives you a look at their thoughts, which helps fill in a bit of backstory, and it also gives you the computer access required to learn about enemy troop movements and other intel that turns into missions where you travel to a location and, generally speaking, destroy everyone that gets in your way.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">If you purchase a new copy of the game (or pay for separate access, which I wouldn't recommend), you'll get access to another tier of missions. Some of these are more like little minigames, where troops are set up in formations and you have to figure out the right way to dive-bomb and take out as many of them as possible. Others are more achievement-like, asking you to rack up a set number of kills with a grenade launcher. Completing these sets of time-release missions gives you bonus material, like an Alex Mercer skin for use in the single-player. Boy, that sure doesn't make any sense in the context of this game's story. Some of them make for interesting diversions, but as a whole, there are already more than enough side missions in the game, and filling it out with even more turns the game into busywork.</p><p style=\"\">That's probably the biggest problem with Prototype 2. Its cooler moments are offset by a long list of missions that aren't engaging at all. You're a man with an ever-increasing list of insane powers, but the tasks you accomplish with those powers are usually pretty ho-hum. Add to all that a script that makes you want to turn the sound down and a dose of awkward control quirks and you've got a run-of-the-mill open-world game.</p>", "deck": "Prototype 2 gives you some interesting abilities that can be fun to use, but it doesn't give you enough good opportunities to cut loose with all that power.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-497/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-33345/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/prototype-2/3030-33345/", "id": 33345, "name": "Prototype 2"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-05-18 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-108524/", "id": 108524, "name": "Prototype 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dragons-dogma-review/1900-498/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/125705/1997342-9050620111020_114536_9_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1997342\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/12/125705/1997342-9050620111020_114536_9_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1997342\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/12/125705/1997342-9050620111020_114536_9_big.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The game is at its best when fighting and climbing beasts.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">You have to admire <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a>\u2019s ambitions with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-34776\" href=\"/dragons-dogma/3030-34776/\" slug=\"dragons-dogma\">Dragon\u2019s Dogma</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"3025-547\" href=\"/monster-hunter/3025-547/\" slug=\"monster-hunter\">Monster Hunter</a>, a series that\u2019s single-handedly kept the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-18\" href=\"/psp/3045-18/\" slug=\"psp\">PSP</a> alive in Japan, just hasn\u2019t caught fire anywhere else.

It\u2019s probably possible to solo Dragon\u2019s Dogma, but I wouldn\u2019t recommend it--you need these guys and girls. You have one main Pawn, who you design early in the game. The other two are (largely) created by other Dragon\u2019s Dogma players, which makes for some goofy allies (I had a high level mage named Ladypants with me for most of my 37 hours) but makes the experience enjoyably personable. For me, my daggers-n-arrows focused archer was balanced out with two support mages--one attacking, another buffing--and a fighter who largely focused on drawing aggro. All of the Pawns can be customized with equipment, but since all but the Pawn you created does not level up, it\u2019s not worth it--it\u2019s better to just recruit new Pawns every few hours.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The system is perfectly set up for other human beings, but Dragon\u2019s Dogma doesn\u2019t feature multiplayer.

This leads to more than a few frustrating scenarios where, say, healing spells are badly needed but everyone is focused on casting lots of fireballs. There are some built-in solutions to help address this, such as potions that temporarily change the attack patterns of your Pawns and the ability to set some generic action recommendations ahead of battle, but there\u2019s nothing as simple and elegant as pulling up a menu and asking Ladypants to cast a holy spell on your daggers to help in crippling the undead.</p><p style=\"\">The real core of Dragon\u2019s Dogma is combat. Thirty-seven hours later, a pile of bodies the size of a mountain in my wake, I was still having fun slicing up goblins and direwolves. The game has a terrifically fun and dynamic combat system that constantly encourages players to experiment. Tapping shoulder buttons brings up adjustable modifiers that give you plenty of options in battle. You gain experience and level, but rather than worrying about assigning points to strength and other attributes, that\u2019s in the background, with the focus on earning and assigning new skills. Like Monster Hunter or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-32697\" href=\"/dark-souls/3030-32697/\" slug=\"dark-souls\">Dark Souls</a>, many of the skills lock players into animations (though there is a skill for some classes that can actually break the animation), so combat becomes a shifting risk/reward proposition. Do you enable your supremely powerful dagger attack but chance missing and being stuck flailing in the wind for a few seconds?</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1835125-11_983.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1835125\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56276595744681\" data-width=\"940\" style=\"width: 940px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/65194/1835125-11_983.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1835125\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/65194/1835125-11_983.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dragon's Dogma's world is certainly big, but big isn't enough.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">And though you choose a class upfront, it\u2019s only a few hours before you can swap to something else. There are even advanced and hybrid classes, such as the magic archer I ended up playing, that aren\u2019t available upfront. It\u2019s easy to switch classes, and if you come to regret the change, it\u2019s a simple matter to go back or try another one. Some skills are even compatible across classes, which means you can begin to craft your own super hybrid that brings the best of several classes under one roof. By the end of my 37 hours, I\u2019d maxed out two classes for both myself and my Pawn, opening up a robust set of skills. Combined with the other Pawns that have their own powers and magic and combat options are vast.</p><p style=\"\">The big payoff is when Dragon\u2019s Dogma introduces its slew of screen-filling creatures--dragons, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2506\" href=\"/hydra/3015-2506/\" slug=\"hydra\">hydras</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1680\" href=\"/griffons/3015-1680/\" slug=\"griffons\">griffins</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1426\" href=\"/ogres/3015-1426/\" slug=\"ogres\">ogres</a>, etc. It looks a little goofy, but the key to defeating them is climbing on their backs and stabbing them in the face/neck/eye. It\u2019s a brutal, bloody <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6522\" href=\"/shadow-of-the-colossus/3030-6522/\" slug=\"shadow-of-the-colossus\">Shadow of the Colossus</a>, and it\u2019s intensely satisfying. There\u2019s nothing quite like hitting a griffin mid-air with fire-infused arrows, watching it crash to the ground, straddling its neck just before it manages to take off, being lifted thousands of feet into the air and stabbing the hell out of it, as it maniacally tries to shake you off. It\u2019s these moments, with you and your Pawns working in tandem to take down these towering enemies, that Dragon\u2019s Dogma shines. It never gets old, and the ability to perpetually switch around your set of combat skills means fighting the same enemies manages to feel fresh, since your approach to it changes.</p><p style=\"\">It\u2019s a good thing the combat holds up, too, because that\u2019s the biggest thing Dragon\u2019s Dogma has going for it. Dragon\u2019s Dogma doesn\u2019t do much with its premise until the very end, at which point the game unloads an hour of completely unexpected, totally batshit crazy exposition. It almost makes the entire story better in retrospect, but such feelings only come after the insane revelations the ending brings, and not a moment sooner. Prior to crazytown, the story is utterly banal. None of the quests have captivating stories behind them, and add zero color to the world at large. Characters are introduced but never given any substance. Bizarre plot twists are wedged in and then completely forgotten, as if they never happened. At one point, you\u2019re jailed for witnessing something very bad, but moments after escaping, the world forgets you were ever jailed. Even when you <i>talk to the character that put you in jail</i>--no response. The utter lack of consequence is littered throughout, and applies directly to the game world, too. Nothing has permanence. The same set of goblins and bandits just outside the main capital are there every time you leave. Every. Single. Time. There is no variation. No matter how often you kill them, they all come right back. Building a world that feels as alive and random as <a data-ref-id=\"3010-786\" href=\"/bethesda-softworks/3010-786/\" slug=\"bethesda-softworks\">Bethesda Game Studios</a> did with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-33394\" href=\"/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim/3030-33394/\" slug=\"the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim\">Skyrim</a> certainly isn\u2019t easy, and while it\u2019s easy to respect Capcom\u2019s ambition in what it tried to create with Dragon\u2019s Dogma, the bar has been set so high, and Dragon\u2019s Dogma isn\u2019t close.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134614/1855230-golem_purp2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1855230\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/134614/1855230-golem_purp2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1855230\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134614/1855230-golem_purp2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/134614/1855230-golem_purp2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The most imposing enemies can take you out in a single swipe.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Compounding the issue is how often Dragon\u2019s Dogma asks players to experience the same locations over and over again. There is fast travel in the game but it\u2019s not very useful. Players can purchase magic stones that enable teleporting back to the main capital, though it\u2019s not until halfway through the game that it becomes possible to transport <i>out</i> of the capital. Even then, you can\u2019t choose a location and be whisked away--you have to physically go to a location and lay down a \u201cportcrystal.\u201d It\u2019s especially infuriating when the game asks you to spend 20 minutes running to a quest location, then come back to the capital, and immediately asks you to head to that location <i>again</i>. It\u2019s one thing if the game had dropped a \u201chey, maybe you should drop the portcrystal here--wink!\u201d hint but it never does.</p><p style=\"\">There\u2019s so much to like about what Capcom gets right with Dragon\u2019s Dogma that it makes the missteps utterly heartbreaking. The combat has enough depth and variety to keep you interested for the duration of the story and beyond, but in terms of what might have been, what should have been, Dragon\u2019s Dogma falls gut-wrenchingly short.</p>", "deck": "Capcom has delivered an open-world game with tremendously fun combat, a hilariously crazy ending, and not much else.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-498/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-34776/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dragons-dogma/3030-34776/", "id": 34776, "name": "Dragon's Dogma"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-05-24 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-113494/", "id": 113494, "name": "Dragon's Dogma"}, "reviewer": "Patrick"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-future-soldier-review/1900-499/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/680/2141437-grfs_image_screen_48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141437\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.52348284960422\" data-width=\"1895\" style=\"width: 1895px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:52.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/680/2141437-grfs_image_screen_48.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2141437\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/680/2141437-grfs_image_screen_48.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This drone is FROM THE FUTURE.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26095\" href=\"/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-future-soldier/3030-26095/\" slug=\"tom-clancys-ghost-recon-future-soldier\">Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon Future Soldier</a> aims to deliver tactical shooter gameplay with a near-future tilt to it. That's not entirely unlike the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-558\" href=\"/ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter/3025-558/\" slug=\"ghost-recon-advanced-warfighter\">Advanced Warfighter</a> games that helped kickstart this generation of consoles back in 2006, but GRFS feels like it's trying to be slightly more realistic and slightly less tactical. The end result is a third-person shooter that feels caught between doctrines--it's not tactical enough to feel like a deep, strategic experience yet it punishes run-and-gun tactics just enough to prevent fans of those sorts of games from having a great time, either.</p><p style=\"\">Though just dropping the word Future into the title of a game is enough to evoke images of rayguns and other out-of-reach gadgets, Future Soldier attempts to keep things grounded by focusing on plenty of technology that's already in-the-works, like <a data-ref-id=\"3055-846\" href=\"/stealth-camouflage/3055-846/\" slug=\"stealth-camouflage\">active camouflage</a> and info-laden HUD units that relay data on enemy positions between soldiers. While most of this stuff isn't seeing wide use on today's battlefields--making the \"future\" designator entirely accurate--it's hard to get excited about tech that's already prevalent in plenty of other video games. Having a fancy HUD might be mind-blowing if you're running through a real-life sandstorm while hunting down enemies, but with the way it's displayed in Future Soldier, it just feels like any other game with any other modern HUD.</p><p style=\"\">From there, the game becomes a cover-based shooter with additional mechanics that give you a distinct upper-hand over the bad guys. These are rolled out to you one mission at a time, so at the beginning you'll start using sensor grenades, which paint enemy targets and show their outlines on your HUD. Later on you'll get access to tiny drones that can fly high above the battlefield and mark targets for the game's \"sync shot\" ability.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2114606-grfsimagescreenshot18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2114606\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5421875\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2114606-grfsimagescreenshot18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2114606\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2114606-grfsimagescreenshot18.jpg\"></a><figcaption>From the drone view you can tag enemies and order your squadmates to take them down.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In Future Soldier you roll as a team of four, and when you're not actively engaged in combat, you can tag enemies with the tap of a button. You can then hold that button down or take one of the shots yourself to trigger a synchronized attack from your squad. In missions where you can't raise any alarms, leaving a man standing is enough to send you back to the last checkpoint, so mastering this decidedly easy-to-master maneuver is crucial. It's satisfying, but it's also so intensely powerful that it feels like you're just stepping from one group of guards to the next, figuring out their patterns from a safe position high above the action, and cleaning them out whenever four or fewer guards peel off from the pack. Other missions do let you engage in direct combat with the enemy, and once this is happening, it's pretty easy to just hide behind cover and take your shots, much like any other cover-based shooter.</p><p style=\"\">With the power of the sync shot, the campaign in Future Soldier gets pretty boring. It also has its share of bugs, including one case where I had to restart several times just to get one of my AI associates to actually make his way up to the spot that triggered the next sequence. This can, theoretically, be alleviated by playing the campaign cooperatively. This makes the sync shot function a little less automatic, and forces you to communicate with your squad. That's probably why the game lacks any sort of proper matchmaking for co-op, forcing you to seek out friends that also want to play Future Soldier. That's a sensible decision, but if people want to fumble their way through the game with a bunch of clumsy strangers, they should at least be given the choice. That also extends to the game's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3021\" href=\"/horde/3015-3021/\" slug=\"horde\">wave-based survival mode</a>, called Guerrilla, which has an \"open\" party setting that seemingly locks down to invite only after you start a game. Either way, you can't get random players into it, which is pretty weak.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2114608-grfsimagescreenshot20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2114608\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.53671875\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:53.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2114608-grfsimagescreenshot20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2114608\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2114608-grfsimagescreenshot20.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2114608-grfsimagescreenshot20.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Alternate vision modes make this sandstorm no problem at all.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">The competitive multiplayer, obviously, doesn't have this problem. The main mode in Future Soldier has you rotating between different objectives as the match goes on, sort of like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-405\" href=\"/killzone/3025-405/\" slug=\"killzone\">Killzone</a>'s multiplayer mode. But most of these involve holding positions to activate <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4910\" href=\"/electromagnetic-pulse/3015-4910/\" slug=\"electromagnetic-pulse\">EMP</a>s that disrupt the enemy's electronics, holding down spots that become resupply points, taking out VIP targets, and so on. The mode forces players to move around the map, and the relative frailty of a single soldier makes teamwork extremely useful. Some of the tech tricks come into play in the multiplayer, giving you occasional looks at where enemies are located. As you earn experience points, you can unlock a lot of additional weapons and attachments. There's also a basic class system, allowing you to choose lighter characters that have active camo or going for more traditional soldiers. The intel system and the way it paints enemy silhouettes onto your HUD as you and your teammates discover their locations is interesting, but at its core it's a pretty standard cover-based shooting experience, just like the campaign. It's not bad.</p><p style=\"\">Despite its bugs and some awkward presentation issues, Future Soldier, as a whole, isn't a bad game. It ticks all the boxes you'd expect a modern-day shooter to have and achieves most of them with a workmanlike quality that might make for a solid rental if the game didn't utilize an online pass for multiplayer access. But if you're looking for something that throws back to the days when the Tom Clancy name on a box actually meant that something unique was inside, Future Soldier comes up short.</p>", "deck": "Ghost Recon Future Soldier has everything you'd expect from a modern shooter, but it doesn't really complete any of its tasks in an especially satisfying way.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-499/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26095/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-future-soldier/3030-26095/", "id": 26095, "name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2012-05-30 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-94405/", "id": 94405, "name": "Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon: Future Soldier"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/gravity-rush-review/1900-500/", "description": "<p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-35617\" href=\"/gravity-rush/3030-35617/\" slug=\"gravity-rush\">Gravity Rush</a> is an easy game to want to love.

It's a wonderful idea executed with only a few dampening caveats, one that makes the game's world utterly thrilling to explore.

I waited very patiently for Gravity Rush to finally kick into gear and start offering me some truly unique puzzles and challenges. And I waited. And waited. And waited some more.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1807503-a3pemuwp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807503\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1807503-a3pemuwp.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1807503\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1807503-a3pemuwp.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Kat is a fascinating character, and her gravity-shifting ability is genuinely amazing.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It never happened.</p><p style=\"\">Instead, Gravity Rush pushes its gravity-shifting mechanic so far to the forefront that you have to wonder if the developers even really knew what to do with their discovery. So much of it revolves around mindless busywork and mediocre combat that you can't help but feel a pang of sadness over the wasted opportunity that is this game.</p><p style=\"\">Don't get me wrong, Gravity Rush is by no means terrible, but no aspect of its game design nor story ever matches up to the genius quality of the game's gravity shifting mechanic. You play as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-19230\" href=\"/kat/3005-19230/\" slug=\"kat\">Kat</a>, a sort of accidental superheroine whose abilities come from her best friend, a celestially-colored cat who grants her the ability to adjust gravity in any direction imaginable. Kat doesn't so much \"fly\" as she does \"fall,\" though she can fall in any direction until she runs into a platform or solid object. Once she does, she can wander around as if she were safe on the ground, even though she might be sideways or upside-down.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Yes, that can be incredibly disorienting. Your only real visual cue as to which way you might be is Kat's hair, which flops in the direction of the normal ground. However, after a few missions and fights, the disorientation mostly gives way to a thrilling sense of freedom. There is a genuine feeling that you can go basically anywhere (within the somewhat restrictive confines of this game world). You can fly up thousands of feet, dash across the roofs of huge buildings to get from one side of the city to the other, and even just float in the air aimlessly, circling around and observing the world that lies before you.</p><p style=\"\">As great as all of that is, it's not much of a game to just fly around with no purpose. So to give your gravity-adjusting antics some context, Gravity Rush tosses together a goofy amnesia storyline, some half-baked combat mechanics, and enough dull errand-running and lite puzzle-solving to more or less fill 10 hours worth of game.</p><p style=\"\">Early on, this stuff is fine. We learn that Kat has arrived in the highly vertical city of Hekesville with no memory of her previous life, where she is, or why this cat is hanging around her giving her insane powers. It turns out that not all is well in Hekesville, as massive gravity storms simultaneously barf out nasty black creatures called the \"nevi,\" and threaten to suck Hekesville whole into some unknown dimension. In fact, large chunks of the city have already disappeared. Shortly after meeting a mysterious man who calls himself a \"creator,\" Kat finds herself all too happy to help out her new place of residence by tracking down the missing parts of the city.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2081455-cm3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081455\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/2081455-cm3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2081455\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/2081455-cm3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Unfortunately, Gravity Rush's designers weren't able to craft an exciting game around that ability.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">In order to do this, Kat must fight a lot of Nevi, float to a number of different checkpoints, sometimes solve minor puzzles, and then repeat the process again and again until the game gets around to its meager conclusion. In theory that would be a fine enough progression, except that the combat dominates far too much of the game for how generally unremarkable it is. On the ground, Kat has a few kicks she can play around with, while in the air, she can deliver more powerful blows by gravity shifting directly into enemies' weak points. The first few times you do it, it's actually pretty cool. Unfortunately, despite earning new abilities over time, the combat never evolves past this initial point. The only wrinkle the game throws at you is increased agility from your enemies, meaning that they're more likely to dodge out of the way of your attacks, or at least blast you mid-kick.</p><p style=\"\">There is a maddening lack of precision in the airborne combat that makes this increased agility an absolute chore. You're not likely to die too often (especially given the bountiful numbers of health power-ups scattered around), but you are likely to get frustrated as you find yourself trying to line up a highly precise attack, only to have the Nevi move out of the way at the last second or get knocked out of the air by an unseen attacker. By the time Gravity Rush gets around to introducing boss fights, you'll be dreading them not because of their difficulty, but because of the game's inability to make fighting them the least bit fun. A lock-on mechanic might have made Gravity Rush's combat too easy, but it also would have eradicated the irritation associated with it.</p><p style=\"\">The sections of the game where you find yourself traversing around checkpoints and solving occasional gravity-based puzzles are at least a bit better, in that they rarely confound or frustrate. But there's also not much to them. You'll bounce around the world, talking to people in obtuse chunks of dialogue, collecting gems and other random items, fixing various broken pieces of the world, and sometimes fight evil things. That's about the whole of the experience. There are optional side missions that involve races through the city, or combat challenges against waves of Nevi, but they don't take good enough advantage of the act of gravity shifting to be worth your while.</p><p style=\"\">Perhaps if the story were more engaging, these issues might be more tolerable. Sadly, Gravity Rush abandons nearly every opportunity to flesh out its interesting world practically from the get-go. You'll be introduced to a number of different characters throughout the story, and it's straight-up maddening how willing the script is to just toss them aside. People who seem like they should be able to offer you simple answers instead speak in obnoxiously cryptic terms just for the sake of keeping that carrot of \"what the hell is going on here?\" dangling in front of you just a bit longer. And by the time it actually gets around to dropping that carrot in front of you, you're left with an abrupt conclusion that's neither satisfying nor particularly coherent.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79994/1892161-gd3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1892161\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.62002567394095\" data-width=\"779\" style=\"width: 779px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/7/79994/1892161-gd3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1892161\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/79994/1892161-gd3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/7/79994/1892161-gd3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gravity Rush never really gets around to fully exploring its own mysteries and characters.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's depressing, because Kat seems like a totally interesting character you'd want to know more about. Being that she is suffering from amnesia, you'd think her big thing would be pushing to find out who she is and where she came from. And yet, she often just abandons her search in favor of the most frivolous activities. It's one thing to take a break from your identity search to rescue children being sucked into a vortex of doom, but she's not even particularly inquisitive when she's just walking around talking to people. Instead of demanding to know what's going on from this creator fellow, she's more than happy to simply go along with whatever vagaries he spouts and enter the magical dimensional vortex that exists inside his trench coat (no, that's not a euphemism) to go fight some more Nevi. And despite the fact that she has no idea who she is, can shift gravity every which way for no identifiable reason, and the whole world is falling into a dark pit of despair from which only she can apparently rescue it, she still finds time to complain about not being able to find a boyfriend in this town. What?</p><p style=\"\">Hekesville is a world you'll want to explore. Its architectural design and gravity-defying placement (it sits atop a huge, narrow column of rock that can barely be called a mountain) are amazing to look at. That Kat can explore it with such freedom of movement is awesome, especially given the game's gorgeous cartoon art style and generally solid frame rate. But without more things to do and more engagement with the player, Gravity Rush can't sustain itself for the long-haul. As it stands, the gravity-shifting gameplay offered might be complete enough for game-starved Vita owners on the hunt for something to do with their device. But do manage your expectations, lest you be disappointed by how hollow Gravity Rush is underneath its breathtaking shell. This is a game that does one thing very well.

Just like real life!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It's not that Gods &amp; Kings does anything to especially revolutionize, or even dramatically improve Civilization V. In fact, for an expansion coming nearly two years after the game's original release (with only some DLC civilizations and map packs to supplement the time in between), it's actually a bit lighter on content than you might be expecting. However, the content that is in there is unquestionably good, making this expansion as devious a gateway back into the throes of Civ V addiction as you're likely to find nowadays.</p><p style=\"\">The biggest addition to Gods &amp; Kings is the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1594\" href=\"/religion/3015-1594/\" slug=\"religion\">religion</a> mechanic. Though religion has existed in the series previously, the version of religion built for this expansion is far more detailed and involved than anything previously seen. It's in keeping with the spirit of the game in that it is a concept that can be built out in a variety of different ways that suit your particular play style. All religion is predicated on faith, which like science, production, and gold, you'll earn over time by building items and structures that increase it over time. Early in a game, you'll have the option to choose a \"pantheon,\" a culture-specific religion that allows you one statistical benefit. This could be something as simple as more gold attained from spaces that generate faith, or more rapid border expansion via the \"religious settlements\" option. Once your pantheon is founded and your civilization begins to grow, you'll eventually spawn a great prophet, a unit that can be used multiple ways down the road, but initially will be consumed to create your religion.</p><p style=\"\">Religion is non-specific in Gods &amp; Kings. Which is to say that there are religions pre-made in the game that run the gamut from Christianity to Zoroastrianism, but it's not as though choosing Christianity will suddenly grant you a Jesus unit you can use to turn lakes into wine vineyards and eventually sacrifice for the sake of some kind of martyrdom boost. The names are just templates. You can name them whatever you want, actually, and the additional benefits you reap from the religion don't have any specificity to the religion itself. They're chosen by you when you first found, and then eventually improve your religion. Again, it's all tailored to how you want to play.<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">Like all things in Civilization V, religion is really more about expansion and diplomacy than anything especially holy. You can build prophets, missionaries, and even inquisitors to spread your religion and stamp out opposing religions. Making other cities and city states fall under your religious banner helps build influence with them. Likewise, pushing enemy cities into your kind of faith helps reduce resistance should you decide to conquer them. It doesn't mean they won't put up a fight, and in fact it may rile up the opposing leader to do something drastic against you. But if you use religion correctly, you'll be dominating the world in no time.</p><p style=\"\">The other big mechanical change is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1238\" href=\"/spies/3015-1238/\" slug=\"spies\">espionage</a>, a more passive mechanic that allows you to plant spies in rival civilizations' cities and city states. The key benefits to espionage are technology and alliances. Planting a spy in a city state ensures that your spy will continuously rig elections in your favor, and even conduct coups if the city state is loyal to another civilization. For major civs, you can place spies in key cities to both keep an eye on what rival leaders are planning, as well as potentially steal the technologies they develop. It's a helpful boost that gives you a bit more diplomatic interaction with your opposing civs, but truthfully it doesn't do a whole lot to change the overall flow of the game. It's just a nice little bonus that, frankly, you might just forget about as the game goes along.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2177488-haileselassie_1334153779.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177488\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2177488-haileselassie_1334153779.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2177488\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2177488-haileselassie_1334153779.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The nine new civilizations bring the total number up to 34. Which is kind of a lot.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Most of the other changes come in the form of tweaks to the existing game and in the form of new civs and items. There are nine new civilizations in Gods &amp; Kings--including the Celts, Swedes, Carthaginians, Ethiopians, and more--each with their own unique units and abilities. In-game, you'll play Gods &amp; Kings pretty much exactly as you did in the main game, though a few adjustments have made for a smoother experience, especially in combat. Ground units can now be stacked with naval units, making it easier to attack sea-adjacent cities, and combat in general has been switched from a 10-point system to a 100-point system. Opposing A.I. has definitely been improved a bit, though other civs can still be oddly non-aggressive when it's clear that you're about to start wrecking shop all over them. Their strategies have improved in some key areas, but with all the additional tools at your disposal to help depose your enemies, odds are you'll want to stick to some of the tougher difficulty levels if you want a noteworthy challenge.</p><p style=\"\">All of this, plus three new scenarios, including the steampunk-themed Empire of the Smoky Skies (which <a data-ref-id=\"1100-4142\" href=\"/a-look-at-civilization-v-gods-kings/1100-4142/\" slug=\"a-look-at-civilization-v-gods-kings\">I've detailed previously here</a>) makes up this add-on. It's a good chunk of content that probably would have looked a lot more impressive a year ago. Given how much time and piecemeal DLC has passed since Civilization V first hit store shelves, Gods &amp; Kings suffers only by virtue of not being overwhelming in its revamping of the Civ V formula. And yet, neither is it underwhelming, given that the things it does add are all distinct improvements, and some are even pretty fantastic. This is a useful and enjoyable expansion to a game that's still one of the great time-stealers of this generation. To put it succinctly: it is more Civilization V to add to your copy of Civilization V. If you still have even a flicker of a desire to play more Civilzation V, that news should be all you need to justify picking up Gods &amp; Kings.</p>", "deck": "Civ V's first real expansion is no revolution, but it's as good an excuse as any to take the plunge back into Firaxis' wonderfully addictive strategy game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-501/", "platforms": "PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-37508/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sid-meiers-civilization-v-gods-kings/3030-37508/", "id": 37508, "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods & Kings"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2012-06-18 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-116183/", "id": 116183, "name": "Sid Meier's Civilization V: Gods & Kings"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/steel-battalion-heavy-armor-review/1900-502/", "description": "<figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2175045\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56484375\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2175045\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2175045-sbhacaptivatescreenshot10bmpjpgcopy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This is the most you'll be able to see of any one mission at a time.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\"><a data-ref-id=\"3030-32695\" href=\"/steel-battalion-heavy-armor/3030-32695/\" slug=\"steel-battalion-heavy-armor\">Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor</a> is thick with irony. It comes from a franchise that once hinged on dozens of buttons, yet this game offers almost no buttons at all. It's designed in such a way that only pixel-perfect aiming and split-second responsiveness will get you through its missions unscathed, but your ability to react quickly and take in your surroundings is so severely compromised that you'll die, repeatedly, in each attempt. It purports to put you right in the middle of piloting a lumbering, tank-like robot, while in reality it frequently destroys the tactile connection between player and game. Put as simply as possible, I don't think you should play Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor.</p><p style=\"\">The problem here is two-fold, split right down the middle between <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3249\" href=\"/kinect-support/3015-3249/\" slug=\"kinect-support\">Kinect</a> functionality that barely functions, and game design that's equal parts boring and frustrating as all hell. The idea of placing you in the cockpit of a realistic battle machine has been done effectively for years on the PC, recreating everything from <a data-ref-id=\"3055-828\" href=\"/submarine/3055-828/\" slug=\"submarine\">submarines</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-438\" href=\"/tank/3015-438/\" slug=\"tank\">tanks</a> to <a data-ref-id=\"3055-675\" href=\"/tie-fighter/3055-675/\" slug=\"tie-fighter\">TIE Fighters</a> and believably putting you in charge of those vehicles' complex arrays of instrumentation. So the very basic, simulation-style premise of Heavy Armor is a sound one. It was the point during development that someone decided nearly all of your walking tank's vital functions--from changing ammunition to viewing a map to pulling down a periscope or closing a front shield vital to protecting your pilot--should be mapped to the imprecise, unreliable Kinect controls that this game went horribly off the rails. I won't go on ad nauseam about all the specific ways the Kinect can misinterpret your inputs and confuse one intended action for another, but it makes this game look utterly ridiculous to anyone watching you from the sidelines, as you flail in vain to do one thing and watch something completely different happen instead.</p><p style=\"\">It's frustrating enough to play a game that flat-out refuses to behave properly, but in Steel Battalion's life-or-death situations, it's absolutely unforgivable that you can't always do exactly what you want to do when you want to do it. This is the sort of game where you peer through a tiny viewport that shows you only a small portion of the battlefield directly in front of you, but you can and do take fire from all sides almost constantly. It's the sort of game where moving your <a data-ref-id=\"3055-21\" href=\"/mech/3055-21/\" slug=\"mech\">mech</a> (called here a \"vertical tank,\" or VT) even a few steps will cause your reticle to bob up and down wildly, making it a delicate balancing act of deciding when to move and when to shoot. You can take critical damage from an enemy VT too far away to see, or a lone foot soldier with an RPG who fires before you can even swivel your turret around and pick him out from the background, and the game is merciless about disabling aspects of your VT like the viewport or, you know, the legs, rendering you blind or inert until you finish the mission or die. (You always die.) I've rarely felt so powerless to tackle a game's challenges as I have while playing this one, and that's not fun, at all.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80630/1862711-steelbattalion_capcom_screenshots_embargoaugust16gmt0900_batch2_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862711\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/80630/1862711-steelbattalion_capcom_screenshots_embargoaugust16gmt0900_batch2_2.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1862711\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/80630/1862711-steelbattalion_capcom_screenshots_embargoaugust16gmt0900_batch2_2.png\"></a><figcaption>What's that, you wanted to close the shutter? Too bad, here's a useless map!</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">It would be easy to blame the failure of this game entirely on the unreliability of Kinect, but Steel Battalion wouldn't even be a good game of this style even if it worked properly. <i>All</i> of the difficulty comes from how slowly you move around the environment and how limited your ability is to identify the threats around you and defend yourself from them. Enemy AI is virtually nonexistent in this game; the infantry stands there motionless and takes pot shots at you even when you're right up in their faces, ready to step on them, and enemy VTs act pretty much the same way aside from mindlessly sidling back and forth occasionally. If anything about your own VT were faster or more precise, you would steamroll over every bit of opposition in this game. The mission design is bland as hell, usually tasking you with merely killing everything in an area, killing as much as you can until the time runs out, or getting to a specific point on the map. Many of the levels are bafflingly short, often involving only a few seconds of meaningful combat in between the embarrassingly stereotypical characters jabbering in your ear. It's also laughable how often your success in a mission hinges on performing some character action with motion control. The first time you fail to fight off an enemy assailant or grab an important object because the Kinect can't read your frantically outstretched arm, and consequently fail a mission because of it, is likely the last time you'll ever want to play this game.</p><p style=\"\">Because I haven't quite let go of the compulsion to run down all of a game's major features in a review, I'll mention that a few of the missions are playable with up to three other people, if you're one who believes misery loves company. If you get a high enough rank on these missions, you can unlock some minor upgrades (a night-vision periscope and a better map, for example) to equip on your VT. It's fitting that when you play these missions solo, there are AI players in there who can actually earn negative points when they perform badly (which they always seem to do), which drags down your overall score and makes it a lot harder to earn any new gear.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2175040\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/13/135472/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-2175040\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/13/135472/2175040-sbhacaptivatescreenshot5bmpjpgcopy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You and me both, buddy.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">To be clear, I take no pleasure in delivering this sort of bad news. Prior to the game's release, it was fun to see how earnestly Heavy Armor embraced what is honestly a pretty silly concept, but one that would be easy to get excited about if it worked right. Moreover, this is a great-looking game in pure aesthetic terms, with some really nice-looking battlefields and environment effects. I love the emphasis on a style of down-and-dirty, purely mechanical warfare clearly inspired by <a data-ref-id=\"3015-471\" href=\"/world-war-ii/3015-471/\" slug=\"world-war-ii\">World War II</a>, back before the fly-by-wire computerization of vehicle control largely automated the process of driving these sorts of war machines. In the game's world, this future reliance on gears and grease follows a catastrophic event called \"Datacide,\" which seems to have destroyed all the advanced micro-electronics in the world and also coincidentally turned <a data-ref-id=\"3035-343\" href=\"/china/3035-343/\" slug=\"china\">China</a> into an imperialist superpower bent on subjugating the rest of the world under the banner of a new United Nations. The game doesn't even do anything interesting with that setup, though, failing to establish memorable characters or create any intrigue between missions. The best you get are some vague allusions to a VT superweapon, but I was often eager to skip the cutscenes and get to the next mission, which, now that I think about it, really says something about the story.</p><p style=\"\">Maybe the latter half of Steel Battalion rivals the work of Shakespeare. I wouldn't know; I only made it to about the midpoint of Heavy Armor's campaign before I threw up my hands in disgust, but I had lost any desire to keep playing it hours before that. You can decide for yourself whether you want to view this game as a blanket indictment of the Kinect as a device for playing \"real\" games, or merely an isolated case of this one game's execution falling far, far short of its ambitious premise. If you're trying to decide whether you should play this game, though, let me save you some trouble: don't.</p>", "deck": "If this is the best Kinect can do with a \"hardcore\" game, you should just pack it up and wait for the next Xbox.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-502/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-32695/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/steel-battalion-heavy-armor/3030-32695/", "id": 32695, "name": "Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor"}, "score": 1, "publish_date": "2012-06-19 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-115746/", "id": 115746, "name": "Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}], "version": "1.0", "limit": 100, "offset": 400, "number_of_total_results": "646"}

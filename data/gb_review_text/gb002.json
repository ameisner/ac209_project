It uses a lot of the same technology that powered <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9993\" href=\"/halo-3/3030-9993/\" slug=\"halo-3\"> Halo 3</a> back in 2007, and it tells a story that exists concurrently with some of the events of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7110\" href=\"/halo-2/3030-7110/\" slug=\"halo-2\"> Halo 2</a> and Halo 3. It makes some interesting changes to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-476\" href=\"/bungie-studios/3010-476/\" slug=\"bungie-studios\"> Bungie</a>'s battle-tested design style, but at its core, it still maintains that Halo feel. If you liked Halo 3 and have any interest in the expanded Halo universe, you'll enjoy the new things that ODST has to offer.<br/> <br/> In ODST, you'll play as an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-641\" href=\"/odst/3015-641/\" slug=\"odst\"> ODST</a>--that's Orbital Drop Shock Trooper. These are the guys that launch down from the sky in pods, and they represent some of Earth's best soldiers. But the key is that the ODSTs are still merely human. They aren't genetically engineered badasses like the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-175\" href=\"/master-chief/3005-175/\" slug=\"master-chief\"> Master Chief</a>. So the characters you play as here are a little more fragile than the shielded and armored super trooper you're used to controlling in Halo games. They aren't tough enough to dual-wield weapons. They aren't rough enough to hijack enemy vehicles. They aren't strong enough to pull off that huge, floaty jump that the Master Chief has. They aren't crafty enough to collect and deploy equipment like you could in Halo 3. And they don't have health that automatically recharges when you take damage. That said, the ODSTs still have shields of some sort. It's referred to as \"stamina\" in-game, but it serves the same purpose as the Chief's shields and recharges when you stay out of battle for a few seconds. Your health meter--the one that gets rocked when you get caught while out of stamina--doesn't recharge on its own. To rectify health issues, you'll have to seek out <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1285\" href=\"/first-aid-kit/3055-1285/\" slug=\"first-aid-kit\"> medkits</a>, which are usually plentiful enough to make health loss a non-issue. Beyond these changes, the ODSTs you'll control in the campaign are roughly equivalent to the big <a data-ref-id=\"3015-666\" href=\"/spartan/3015-666/\" slug=\"spartan\"> Spartan</a>.<br/> <br/> The other big change in ODST is that these guys are equipped with different helmet-based heads-up displays. The new HUD--which comes from your visor and is helpfully called VISR--comes with a light amplification option that brightens things up and enhances the edges of objects. This is handy, as significant portions of the campaign are done under cover of darkness. The edge enhancement is especially cool in the darkest areas. The lines it draws around the edges of things makes the game look like some kind of militaristic <i>Tron</i> arena or something. While you don't have a motion sensor, hitting the back button brings up a map of the city, showing you where you need to go, nearby enemies, and more. The map screen, also, looks really nice. The key reason for having a map--as well as an on-screen compass that directs you to waypoints--is that a chunk of ODST is played in a sort of open-world hub that links the game's missions together.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1104610-halo_3_odst_20090130094723553_640w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104610\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1149732620321\" data-width=\"374\" style=\"width: 374px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:111.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48227/1104610-halo_3_odst_20090130094723553_640w.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1104610\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/4/48227/1104610-halo_3_odst_20090130094723553_640w.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Who is The Rookie?</figcaption></figure>The open nature of the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-12\" href=\"/new-mombasa/3035-12/\" slug=\"new-mombasa\"> New Mombasa</a> streets makes sense in the context of the game's story. Five ODST troops drop into New Mombasa with a Naval Intelligence officer named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10969\" href=\"/dare/3005-10969/\" slug=\"dare\"> Dare</a>. She doesn't really get into the specifics of the mission, and things go wrong almost immediately because your insertion pods are knocked off course when a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-81\" href=\"/the-covenant/3015-81/\" slug=\"the-covenant\"> Covenant</a> cruiser positioned above the city jumps into slipspace. This rips up the city and sends your team's pods careening off-course, separating the crew. The game opens with you in control of a character known only as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11077\" href=\"/the-rookie/3005-11077/\" slug=\"the-rookie\"> The Rookie</a>. He immediately hooks up with the city's computers, giving you map data and navigation points that point you in the direction of the rest of your team. When you get to the proper location (usually by finding a key item, like Dare's helmet, or a bent-up <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\"> sniper rifle</a>), the game switches into a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-226\" href=\"/flashback/3015-226/\" slug=\"flashback\"> flashback</a>. These are the game's missions, and most of them put you in the role of one of the other members of your team. These missions are linear and very much designed in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2\" href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" slug=\"halo\"> Halo</a> tradition. Once you complete a mission, The Rookie gets new data and moves to the next spot. The juxtaposition between the quiet, nighttime city, where The Rookie can stick to the shadows and avoid a lot of combat as he moves from spot to spot and the large, loud battles that you've come to expect from the Halo series is an interesting one. Even though there isn't that much to do when you're not in an active mission, the dark, open city gives ODST a very different atmosphere from the other games in the line. The game's great soundtrack really contributes to that feel, as well.<br/> <br/> As you work your way through the city, you may run into one of the 30 audio clips hidden there. These are designed to be a basic <a data-ref-id=\"3015-375\" href=\"/collectibles/3015-375/\" slug=\"collectibles\"> collectible</a> and to give you a reason to run around the entire city, rather than just sticking to the critical path and heading from one mission to the next. The clips string together to form a fairly interesting story that's set around the time of the Covenant first landing at New Mombasa. It also gives you some insight into the nature of the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11142\" href=\"/superintendent/3005-11142/\" slug=\"superintendent\"> Superintendent</a>, which is a city-wide AI that subtly guides you around the city by changing video screens around town to big detour arrows aimed in the direction of your next objective or a nearby audio log. The story that plays out in these audio logs is tied to the game's story, but it features more interesting characters than the actual game does. The Rookie doesn't speak, which sort of makes him the most interesting character by default. The rest of the ODST crew chats it up, but a lot of that dialogue feels forced, with plenty of generic-sounding military talk. And the all-too-convenient romantic past between the ODST squad leader and the female naval intelligence officer doesn't bring any heat to the proceedings.<br/> <br/> The campaign kept me going for just under seven hours on the game's \"heroic\" difficulty setting. Like Halo 3 before it, the developers recommend that players familiar with the series start at this setting. On normal or lower, the combat is painfully easy--which is fine if you're a novice, but won't be much fun for anyone else. On the highest setting, again known as legendary, the game becomes much more of a challenge, making it something that's best suited for cooperative play. Like Halo 3 before it, ODST allows up to four players to play via Xbox Live or LAN. It's a fun way to play, though there's something cool about the solitary nature of The Rookie's portion of the journey that doesn't feel quite right when you're rolling around with three partners.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/1042391-h3odst_preparetodropcinematic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042391\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/1042391-h3odst_preparetodropcinematic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042391\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/1042391-h3odst_preparetodropcinematic.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/1042391-h3odst_preparetodropcinematic.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The squad, before everything goes wrong.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>In addition to playing the campaign cooperatively, there's also a new co-op mode called firefight. This is a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3567\" href=\"/survival-mode/3015-3567/\" slug=\"survival-mode\"> survival-type mode</a>, which puts the players in a confined area and sets them against waves of Covenant enemies. The longer you last and the more enemies you take down, the higher you score. As you clear out waves, the game turns on more and more skulls, which are the secret items that you could use to modify the difficulty in Halo 3. In ODST, all of the skulls are the same, but they're all automatically unlocked from the get-go. Firefight encourages players to hunker down and defend small areas, sort of like the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20662\" href=\"/gears-of-war-2/3030-20662/\" slug=\"gears-of-war-2\"> Gears of War 2</a> horde mode. For me, though, Halo is all about shooting on the move, not sitting down and controlling a specific spot. That's probably the reason why I don't find firefight to be very engaging, especially on its higher difficulty settings.<br/> <br/> If that was the complete package, ODST would be a pretty good expansion type of package, provided it was available at an expansion sort of price. But there's a second disc in the package that offers every bit of Halo 3's competitive multiplayer, including all of the downloadable maps that have been made available via the Xbox Live Marketplace since Halo 3's release. It's a weird offering, because I find it hard to believe that anyone thinking about buying ODST doesn't already have Halo 3. And in the case of fanatical Halo fans, chances are they already paid for one or more of the map packs when they were released digitally. The one catch is that this disc, marked \"Halo 3: Mythic,\" comes with three maps that will be exclusive to this collection. It's a convenient disc for Halo 3 multiplayer fans to own, but it feels like something that was tacked onto the collection in order to further justify the package's $59.99 price tag... and it's something that a sizable piece of the game's prospective audience probably already owns.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/1042379-h3odst_dutchcinematic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042379\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/118/1042379-h3odst_dutchcinematic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042379\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/1042379-h3odst_dutchcinematic.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/118/1042379-h3odst_dutchcinematic.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>They're not the Master Chief, but they have most of his moves.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Though the technology that powered Halo 3 has aged, ODST still looks quite nice for a 2009 release. That's mostly thanks to the lighting. New Mombasa looks great at night, as the raging fires around the city give the sky a red glow, while the whole area is large enough to give you the sense of being stranded in a big, enemy-filled area. The video signs, which flicker to life as the Superintendent passes you messages, have a clean design style that really adds to the game's look and feel. The daytime missions look fine, as well.<br/> <br/> Halo 3: ODST fills in a few interesting spots in the Halo timeline, even if the characters themselves aren't strong enough to carry the narrative. But it strikes a healthy balance between new twists and more content done in Bungie's trademark style. The more important thing is that if you've enjoyed playing Bungie's Halo games in the past, chances are you'll continue to enjoy that style in ODST.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><i>Disclosure: The game featured in this review is or was an advertised product on giantbomb.com.</i>", "deck": "If you like the way Bungie makes first-person shooters, you'll enjoy Halo 3: ODST.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-202/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24035/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/", "id": 24035, "name": "Halo 3: ODST"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-09-19 21:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-77671/", "id": 77671, "name": "Halo 3: ODST"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/scribblenauts-review/1900-203/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915451-scribblenauts022009005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915451\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75193798449612\" data-width=\"258\" style=\"width: 258px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915451-scribblenauts022009005.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915451\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/915451-scribblenauts022009005.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The dictionary here is pretty humongous.</figcaption></figure>I don't think I've ever wanted to like a game as much as I wanted to like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24741\" href=\"/scribblenauts/3030-24741/\" slug=\"scribblenauts\">Scribblenauts</a>. The concept grabbed me immediately: a puzzle game that lets you conjure nearly any conceivable object to form your own solutions must surely encourage wild bouts of creativity and liberate you from the constraints that most games place on your problem-solving skills. Here and there Scribblenauts verges on this ideal scenario, but most of the time your creative freedom is hindered by a host of mechanical problems that stop the game from fulfilling all of its potential.<br/> \u00a0<br/>The game's tagline is \"Write anything. Solve everything.\" That's a surprisingly honest piece of promotion, because you can open up a text input window at any time and type in any noun you can think of, then have it appear right there in the game world.\u00a0Scribblenauts is quite literally at its best at the game's title screen, which doubles as a sandbox where you can input sample words endlessly to see what you can create, and how your creations will interact with each other. This demo level acts as the purest demonstration of the game's core concept. You can summon a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-684\" href=\"/manticore/3015-684/\" slug=\"manticore\">manticore</a> to fight a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-117\" href=\"/vampire/3015-117/\" slug=\"vampire\">vampire</a>, hop on a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1746\" href=\"/hoverboard/3055-1746/\" slug=\"hoverboard\">hoverboard</a> and zoom around, or type in \"laser sword\" and marvel at how much the resulting object looks like a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-70\" href=\"/lightsaber/3055-70/\" slug=\"lightsaber\">lightsaber</a>. There's a lot of really clever and sometimes in-jokey stuff you can do by combining different characters and objects together, and experimentation is very much encouraged. Aside from vulgarities and copyrighted terms, the game will accept just about anything you feed it, and the breadth of the dictionary is impressive when you're just messing around with it.<br/> \u00a0<br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915444-5th_cell_scribblenauts_cg_dec19th_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915444\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915444-5th_cell_scribblenauts_cg_dec19th_003.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915444\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/915444-5th_cell_scribblenauts_cg_dec19th_003.jpg\"></a><figcaption>  Getting around and interacting with things is way more frustrating than it should be. \u00a0</figcaption></figure>It's when you play Scribblenauts as a <i>game</i> and have to start using your creative powers in practical ways to solve puzzles that the limitations of the game's mechanics become quickly, painfully obvious. The biggest problem is a broad lack of consistency in nearly every aspect of the gameplay. You can make a huge number of objects, but a lot of them don't behave in the ways you'd logically expect or want them to. Why doesn't a fire extinguisher put out a flame? How come the stock bridge isn't long enough to cross any of the level designs' chasms? (And who would ever think to try the bafflingly much longer \"bascule bridge\" instead?) Most importantly, what good is an enormous library of objects if you end up falling back on the same dozen or so reliable ones time after time?<br/> <br/> The controls, physics, and general object interactions are all over the place, too. You tap with the stylus to move, and walking and jumping are automated, so it's way too easy to accidentally make your scribblenaut Maxwell fall into a pit of lava or get snared by a monster, which will often kill you faster than you can flee, much less create an object to fight back with. Simple actions like targeting another character to use an object on them are clumsier and less precise than they should be. Non-player characters will often run off of cliffs or fail to properly interact with an object or even the ground, getting themselves killed or knocking down the contraptions you've carefully constructed to meet your objective.<br/> <br/> Many of the dozens of puzzle levels impose various constrictive rulesets on your solutions, causing you to fail outright if the wrong character dies or you use an object in the wrong way. The game also doesn't provide a reason when you fail a level, which makes it incredibly frustrating to see a \"Try Again\" screen pop up unexpectedly and seemingly without provocation. At least you unlock new levels in fairly large chunks, so you're almost always able to skip around and try new ones when you're having problems, but you're just as likely to hit another brick wall when you move on to the next challenge.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915448-scribblenauts022009002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915448\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75757575757576\" data-width=\"264\" style=\"width: 264px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/915448-scribblenauts022009002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915448\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/915448-scribblenauts022009002.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/7465/915448-scribblenauts022009002.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Perhaps a black hole would help?</figcaption></figure>At least there's an enormous amount of content in Scribblenauts, with 10 themed worlds that contain more than 20 levels each.

But you're always going to run into the same issues with the gameplay, so you may never even get around to unlocking and experiencing all that content.<br/> <br/> Scribblenauts is a great proof-of-concept that struggles under the weight of its own ambition and the expectations that resulted from its uniquely exciting premise.

Walking outside the RV drops you into the middle of your pit area on race day with a throng of fans milling about. Here you can choose the car you want for the race and customize it with liveries, horns, and dashboard and mirror toys like hula dolls and fuzzy dice, all of which are earned throughout the course of your career.<br/><br/>Events in the original Dirt were unlocked by placing highly in the races leading up to a particular event. Dirt 2 does away with that in favor of a leveling system. Players get experience points for not just placing well in races, but also for the game's \"missions,\" which keep track of your all-time stats like drift distance, time on two wheels, and so on, and give you XP rewards when you break certain milestones. These generous handouts make the career progression much more forgiving, which is fortunate since winning is tough to do. Despite my familiarity with the original Dirt, and the fact that I was playing in the second-lowest difficulty setting, I won only occasionally. Frankly, I found this to be refreshing; the game became more about having fun in races than coming in first, though for those of a more competitive persuasion, there is definitely room for you.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1145152-map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1145152\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1145152-map.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1145152\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23546/1145152-map.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Gain levels by earning XP to unlock more locales and events.</figcaption></figure>  Dirt 2's career mode is divided into nine distinct locales across the globe. Each area has a variety of events, including Rally (point-to-point timed races), Trailblazer (similar to rally, only with faster cars and straighter tracks), Rally Cross (smaller, motocross-style races, often indoor), Landrush (truck and buggy circuit races), and Raid (like Landrush but point-to-point). Raid events are especially fun, since they are the only events to feature split tracks--a new feature in Dirt 2--where the course forks off, allowing the player to choose one of two routes. This leads to a lot of exciting moments when the tracks merge back together, creating near-misses or spectacular wrecks.<br/><br/>Though Dirt 2 does away with a lot of the more oddball event types of the original (I'm looking at you, Big Rig Hill Climb), it substitutes them with more interesting variants. These special modes range from hitting gates to extend your time in Gatecrasher, and the elimination-style Last Man Standing, where the driver in last place gets eliminated every 20 seconds. Progressing in the career will eventually unlock World Tours for each of the five main events, which yield handsome XP and monetary rewards, and the three X-Games events (Europe, Asia, and America), which include a variety of races and reward you with things like new cars. Multiplayer has been souped-up as well. Whereas the original Dirt's multiplayer was limited to point-to-point races, Dirt 2 includes everything from the full-contact Raid events to the arcade-style Gatecrasher. Multiplayer even has its own XP system (called FP for \"Fame Points\"), which go toward your purely-for-bragging-rights online rank.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1145165-water.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1145165\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23546/1145165-water.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1145165\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23546/1145165-water.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23546/1145165-water.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Water slows you down and obscures your vision.</figcaption></figure>  Dirt 2 is fully featured, but where it really shines is in the details. The physics in Dirt 2 are impeccable. When a truck tumbles after taking a hard landing off a jump, it looks and behaves exactly as it should, which is critical if you're behind the truck anticipating its motion across your driving line. The physics are so realistic that the vibration from my idling engine would shake the skirt on my dash-mounted hula doll. Physics also come into play in the water hazards that now dot many of the courses. Driving through water will slow you down (though this can be advantageous if used strategically), and if you're driving from the cockpit view, my preferred perspective, it will obscure your vision for a few crucial seconds. Dirt 2 also features nighttime races, confined to Rally Cross events, which add a whole new dimension to the game. You will have to avoid smashing your headlights on those tight corners if you want to see, and decide if you want to overtake the leader and risk underestimating a dark turn or let him show you the best line through the corners.<br/><br/>The biggest change from the original Dirt comes in the form of flashbacks, borrowed from Codemaster's street racing title <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20729\" href=\"/grid/3030-20729/\" slug=\"grid\">              GRID</a>. At any point in a single-player race, provided you have not used up your allotted number of flashbacks, you can press the right shoulder button to trigger an instant replay of the last few seconds, complete with VCR controls. Rewind time to before that last wreck, and you've got a second chance to take that turn a little slower. I had my doubts about the implementation of this feature, thinking it would become a crutch and detract from the tension of going for a wreck-free race, but in practice I used it only to recover from debilitating accidents, occurrences that would have required a restart of the whole race in the original Dirt.<br/><br/>That's the thing about Dirt 2: it's just friendlier. The career mode is not as strict, you get XP rewards left and right, and you can undo boneheaded moves. I even found myself using the Vehicle Setup option to fine-tune my car's performance, something that I shied away from in the original Dirt because of how intimidating it was. I'm no gearhead, but after listening to the succinct audio descriptions for things like gear ratios and brake bias, I began tweaking away on the simplified sliders, instantly noticing huge improvements in my car's handing and speed.<br/><br/>The original Dirt was a fantastic game. It had great driving physics, graphics, and a slick presentation, all of which conspired to create one of my favorite racing games of all time.

It looks like an action game that revolves around a series of two-dimensional motocross obstacle courses, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-15025\" href=\"/excitebike/3030-15025/\" slug=\"excitebike\"> Excitebike</a> for the modern age. But when you get down to it, Trials is really an intensely technical physics puzzle that requires you to not just drive but <i>feel</i> every foot of each course to navigate all the hellishly tricky jumps and traps in each level. The game got a little too hard a little too quickly for my taste, but there's a lot of room for you to increase your skill here, and feel the reward that goes along with doing so.<br/> <br/> Things you will need to enjoy Trials HD: an eye for detail; a good feel for two-wheeled driving mechanics; patience. A lot of patience. The game's levels are split into five difficulties, and by the time you get into the third one, you'll be spending most of your time inching along from one obstacle to the next, failing over and over until you figure out exactly how you need to pop up your front tire or exactly when you need to lean backwards just a bit to get the right momentum and angle to pass a given trick. Thankfully there's a checkpoint after every single trick, and you can restart at the touch of a button. Otherwise this game would be utterly unbearable.<br/> <br/> The driving mechanics couldn't be much simpler. Accelerate with the right trigger, brake with the left, and lean forward and backward with the analog stick. The rest is up to gravity. You're going to be fighting gravity for much of the game, since so many of the later courses ask you to basically drive up sheer walls and perform other absurd feats of two-wheeled daring. As you make your way through a new course, you'll frequently pause and say \"Really? You want me to do that?\" But there's always a way to pull it off, even if you need to hit YouTube to figure out exactly what it is.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/1046094-trials_hd_screen_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1046094\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/1046094-trials_hd_screen_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1046094\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4344/1046094-trials_hd_screen_10.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Yeah, more like this.</figcaption></figure>Trials HD is sadistically, controller-throwingly hard, but it's the kind of hard you will continuously (if slowly) get better at as you practice. I just wish the difficulty curve were a little smoother over the course of the five tiers. The first two aren't much trouble and you'll breeze through them quickly, but there doesn't feel like much middle ground here. The game goes from manageable to crazy hard in the space of just a few races. It's very possible you will never finish the last two or three courses in the game; they're just that hard. I wish the developer had crammed in a larger number of moderately challenging levels in the middle somewhere.<br/> <br/> Powering through the main challenge courses was my primary occupation in Trials HD, but there's a decent assortment of skill-based minigames in here too. You do things like ride inside a giant hamster ball or run a course while towing a wagon full of bombs behind you. Most of them center around how far you can make it before you meet some kind of unfortunate demise, which is always good for a laugh.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/1046093-trials_hd_screen_09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1046093\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/1046093-trials_hd_screen_09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1046093\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4344/1046093-trials_hd_screen_09.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4344/1046093-trials_hd_screen_09.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Some minigames pad out the extra content.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Trials is especially fun if a lot of other people on your friends list have been playing it, since you can see their best times and how many times they crashed as they tried to finish a level. Leaderboards are nothing special, of course, but they're more effective here when you see that your friend racked up 300 failures as they tried to suffer through one of the meanest, hardest tracks. You can sort of feel their pain. It's also neat that you can see how fast one of your friends ran a given course relative to your own position in real time as you run it yourself. It's not quite as good as an actual ghost feature, but it's close.<br/> <br/> You can make your own levels in Trials HD with a pretty easy-to-use, capable level editor if you want to extend the game's playability once you finish all the content that comes with the game (if you ever do). Though, perplexingly, you can only download levels from people on your friends list. That's a real shame, because I would have liked to see how inventive--and ludicrously hard--some of the top user-created levels might be. But there's no way to browse all of the ones that are out there.<br/> <br/>More than likely, though, you'll get your money's worth out of what's already included in this package. Trials HD is geared toward a specific kind of game player, one who can put up with the repetition and attention to minute detail required to master its courses. If you're that sort of person, you'll find a lot of satisfying gameplay here. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "Physics and sadism combine to great effect in this motocross action game on Xbox Live Arcade.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-205/", "platforms": null, "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26923/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/trials-hd/3030-26923/", "id": 26923, "name": "Trials HD"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-09-23 17:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/pinball-hall-of-fame-the-williams-collection-revie/1900-206/", "description": "<p style=\"\">The <a data-ref-id=\"3010-3243\" href=\"/williams-electronic-games-inc/3010-3243/\" slug=\"williams-electronic-games-inc\">Williams</a> name has appeared on some of the world's finest pinball tables, and a handful of Williams machines have been virtualized and compiled here in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20994\" href=\"/pinball-hall-of-fame-the-williams-collection/3030-20994/\" slug=\"pinball-hall-of-fame-the-williams-collection\">Pinball Hall of Fame: The Williams Collection</a>.

Medieval Madness represents one of the last great hurrahs for mainstream pinball, while stuff like Pin*Bot and Black Knight sum up the 1980s pretty well. There are definitely some heavy omissions that I'd consider to be \"hall of fame\" worthy, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4509\" href=\"/high-speed/3030-4509/\" slug=\"high-speed\">High Speed</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20898\" href=\"/f-14-tomcat/3030-20898/\" slug=\"f-14-tomcat\">F-14 Tomcat</a>, but the spread here is pretty good.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12096/359505-i_pinballhalloffamewilliams02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-359505\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/12096/359505-i_pinballhalloffamewilliams02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-359505\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/12096/359505-i_pinballhalloffamewilliams02.jpg\"></a><figcaption> The game's main menu is a virtual arcade, which is totally needless and makes moving from one game to the next take longer than it should.\u00a0</figcaption></figure> These re-created and emulated pinball tables are also pretty good. There are a few spots where I wish the art was higher-resolution, and I found myself having to fiddle with the game's camera options a lot to find the right setting for each table, but they play properly and feel like they should. Though there was one weird case where the ball somehow broke out of the pinball machine and flew off the screen. The error was quickly noticed by the game, which spawned a new ball so that play could continue. But still, that... probably shouldn't happen.<br/> <br/>  On the surface, the main goal is to just play these various tables for high scores. Each table keeps its own set of high scores, and you can view online leaderboards, as well. If you dig a bit deeper, each table has a set of goals for you to attempt to accomplish. The Xbox 360 version's achievements are tied to these table goals. There are two sets of five goals for each table, and the second \"wizard\" set doesn't unlock until you complete the basic set. This can get a little annoying if you're having a good early run on a game. There were multiple occasions where I satisfied all of the basic goals on my first play, and I would have achieved some of the wizard goals, as well, but they don't open up until your game ends.<br/> <br/>  You don't need me to tell you that digital pinball isn't for everyone.

What would games look like today if all the time, money, and effort spent developing polygonal technology had instead been poured into the 2D sprites that had served us all so well through the 8- and 16-bit eras? (I've also fantasized about a world where <a data-ref-id=\"3015-604\" href=\"/full-motion-video/3015-604/\" slug=\"full-motion-video\">        FMV games</a> are the dominant format, but that's not really relevant here.) Japanese developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4211\" href=\"/vanillaware-ltd/3010-4211/\" slug=\"vanillaware-ltd\">       Vanillaware</a>'s existence seems predicated on trying to realize that vision, and its latest, Muramasa: The Demon Blade, is an absolute visual triumph. Even if it didn't also offer a distinctive take on the dynamics of the traditional 2D brawler, Muramasa is such an incredible pleasure to see in motion that it could easily skate by in its good looks alone.<br/><br/>Much like how Vanillaware's PlayStation 2 action RPG <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9235\" href=\"/odin-sphere/3030-9235/\" slug=\"odin-sphere\">      Odin Sphere</a> mined Norse mythology for its story and setting, Muramasa delves into the weird and mystical past of feudal Japan, a world populated with <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1418\" href=\"/shogun/3015-1418/\" slug=\"shogun\">     shoguns</a>, evil monks, samurai, and ninja, as well as talking foxes, evil spirits, ethereal swordmakers, and demon gods. It's a surreal world where political intrigue and cultural hierarchies extend to the realm of the supernatural, and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-24\" href=\"/hell/3035-24/\" slug=\"hell\">    Hell</a> is literally within walking distance.<br/><br/> There are two main quests in Muramasa, and each tells a different character's story. There's Momohimo, a young noble girl whose ill-fated plans for marriage are crushed completely when her body gets taken over by the spirit of a powerful and unpleasant swordsman named Jinkuro, who needs Momohimo's body to complete his sword-based plans. The other story concerns a disgraced young ninja named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10591\" href=\"/kisuke/3005-10591/\" slug=\"kisuke\">   Kisuke</a> who suffers from amnesia on a quest to find a special sword. Though they intertwine at a few key spots, the stories are largely independent from each other, and generally well-told, without smothering the player in overwrought melodrama or hammer-subtle broad comedy. Both plots definitely benefit from the florid use of Japanese mythology, and the (presumably cost-saving) decision to retain the original Japanese voice work also adds to the sense of verisimilitude. I'm not all that familiar with Japanese mythology, but this is all just bizarre enough to feel totally accurate.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/958863-943228_20090421_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958863\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5615763546798\" data-width=\"812\" style=\"width: 812px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/958863-943228_20090421_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-958863\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/958863-943228_20090421_screen001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The importance of having the right sword for the situation cannot be stressed enough. </figcaption></figure> All of this serves as a wonderfully colorful backdrop for you to murder all manner of corporeal and supernatural fools on.

This is, essentially, a three-button game--one to attack and block, one to unleash a sword-specific special attack, and one to switch between swords--with all movement assigned to the analog stick. It's pretty button-mashy throughout, but to mistake its simplicity for ease would be foolish. On the harder of the two difficulties, it's not long before careful management of your swords and health items are key to survival, particularly during the ridiculously detailed, screen-filling boss battles. What variety of action that Muramasa does offer largely comes from the various swords you'll handle over the course of the game. The name Muramasa is actually that of a pan-dimensional swordmaker who lends you his talents in exchange for the souls of your fallen enemies. Though you can only have three swords equipped at a time, there are over a hundred swords to be unlocked. There are two general categories of swords, and it's a speed versus power thing, though there are a number of unique special attacks to consider as well. There's a certain amount of mixing and matching of features being done to achieve that high sword count, but having the right swords at the ready can make all the difference in certain situations.<br/><br/>Though it features certain RPG affectations--such as experience levels, equipment upgrades, and a non-linear world map--Muramasa is essentially a brawler, albeit one with a somewhat unusual format. The basic flow of the game has you traveling from one location to another, with your progress regularly interrupted by some kind of ambush, be it by samurai, ninja, ghost, demon, or a swarm of hairy eyeballs. With a few exceptions, the battle sequences are contained events, once you must deal with before you can continue on your journey. It creates an interesting rhythm of tension-and-release--you'll fight furiously for 30 seconds, then sprint your way through a few beautifully rendered backdrops before squaring off with another gang of villains.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/883281-oboro01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-883281\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56262833675565\" data-width=\"487\" style=\"width: 487px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/14945/883281-oboro01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-883281\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14945/883281-oboro01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/14945/883281-oboro01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0It's difficult to articulate just how breathtaking this looks in motion.</figcaption></figure>  Muramasa would be an interesting little curiosity if Japanese mythology and genre-blending were all it had to offer, but it's the game's hand-drawn art style that truly makes it something special. Owing much to both traditional Japanese watercolors and modern anime, Vanillaware has conjured up a visual style that is distinctly and throughly Japanese. The character animations are fluid, and all the environments, from rolling countrysides to dense, paper-walled cities, is rendered with incredible detail. The game also has a bit of an infatuation with the pseudo-3D effect of parallax scrolling. It's not uncommon to see up to ten distinct layers on a single screen, a move that goes well beyond simply trying to create a false sense of depth and becomes a prominent stylistic choice. The game's not shy about modern technology either, as there's plenty of lighting and particle effects subtly integrated into the picture. If there's one complaint I have about the visuals in Muramasa, it's that the Wii can't present them at a higher resolution. It looks great, but at 720p, it could've looked even better.<br/><br/>For all it's got going for it, though, Muramasa's problem is that it simply overstays its welcome. This is a good 14-hour game, and the gameplay cannot support that kind of play time. I found myself wishing that the game was about half the length it is, which would've left me satisfied, rather than fully exhausted. Playtime notwithstanding, Muramasa is a pretty special experience. There's a lot of craft in this game, and it manages to celebrate past glories while still feeling fresh and original.", "deck": "Vanillaware's lush and layered visuals and the game's razor-sharp combat elevate Muramasa well beyond your average brawler.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-207/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24017/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/muramasa-the-demon-blade/3030-24017/", "id": 24017, "name": "Muramasa: The Demon Blade"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-09-28 21:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83149/", "id": 83149, "name": "Muramasa: The Demon Blade"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dead-space-extraction-review/1900-208/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1095974-controlroom01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1095974\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6875\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1095974-controlroom01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1095974\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1095974-controlroom01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Something bad is about to happen here. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure>I almost feel like I need to offer apologies or excuses while recommending <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25358\" href=\"/dead-space-extraction/3030-25358/\" slug=\"dead-space-extraction\"> Dead Space Extraction</a>, EA's Wii follow-up to last year's breakout original sci-fi horror shooter. Extraction's marketing campaign would like you to think of it as a \"guided experience\" that whisks you through the dramatic beginnings of the series' horrible space-monster outbreak, but in blunt terms, Extraction is an on-rails shooter. Blunter still: it's a light-gun game. These days, that's not a style of game serious game players usually gravitate toward. But keeping the genre's inherent restrictions in mind--not to mention the limitations of the Wii hardware--Extraction is really pretty good, for what it is.<br/> <br/> You will certainly get the most mileage out of Extraction if you played through the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20800\" href=\"/dead-space/3030-20800/\" slug=\"dead-space\"> Dead Space</a>, which the new game serves as a prequel to. You'll revisit a lot of familiar locations on <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1819\" href=\"/aegis-7/3035-1819/\" slug=\"aegis-7\"> Aegis VII</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1678\" href=\"/usg-ishimura/3035-1678/\" slug=\"usg-ishimura\"> USG </a><a data-ref-id=\"3035-1678\" href=\"/usg-ishimura/3035-1678/\" slug=\"usg-ishimura\"> Ishimura</a> as you retrace the original excavation of the insidious artifact known as \"the marker,\" and then battle the awful creatures that overrun the colony and ship in its wake. You're not any one character throughout the game; instead you swap between several perspectives among a group of survivors, revealing different areas of the ship and the different motivations of each person unlucky enough to be caught up in this awful mess.<br/> <br/> The story is pretty thin--it's mostly a bare, on-the-run survival tale--but there are a couple of small, interesting elements that seem like they may tie into the inevitable Dead Space sequel. Also, the voice acting is flatly passable, for the most part, but there is some campy, B-movie-sounding bad delivery that actually works in the game's favor. The characters you run around with are unique and well-animated enough that I managed to identify with them and care to some degree about their eventual fates. I was surprised I came to care at all about the characters in a game of this sort.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/961926-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-961926\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.68849206349206\" data-width=\"504\" style=\"width: 504px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:68.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/961926-5.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-961926\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7423/961926-5.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The shooting is surprisingly good in Extraction.</figcaption></figure>I was also surprised to find that, hardly a year after the first Dead Space came out, I was already eager to jump back into the<i> </i>Ishimura's hellish corridors and stomp around in that world a little more. The Wii is certainly less capable than any platform you may have played the first game on, but the developers did a great job maintaining the art style and the Ishimura's specific design elements to visually tie the two games together and make this one look great. The sound design is also quite consistent, making this a comfortably familiar package for veterans from the first game.<br/> <br/> Even if it's your first Dead Space, the shooting here is complex enough to be satisfying throughout. That's mainly because Extraction totally replicates the first game's grisly dismemberment mechanics, letting you--no, <i>encouraging</i> you to shoot heads, arms, legs, and other grotesque appendages off of the monsters that are constantly assaulting you. They die much faster that way, and the variety of weapons--most from the first game, with a couple of minor additions--give you a lot of different ways to take the monsters apart. You can also throw in a second player whenever you want, though it isn't necessary on the default difficulty.<br/> <br/> There's only a moderate number of out-of-place Wii-based motion controls in the game. You'll occasionally shake the remote to fling a monster off of you or swipe the nunchuk for a melee attack. There's a computer-hacking minigame that makes you use the pointer to trace some circuits past different obstacles, which can be a little tough if you don't have a very steady hand. But thankfully the shooting is your primary occupation here. You twist the Wii remote 90 degrees to enable the alt-fire modes on each weapon, which ends up working well enough.<br/> <br/> Extraction has most of the other things you'd look for from a Dead Space, too--things like audio logs, weapon upgrades, and character progression. Even the kinesis and stasis powers factor into the combat and puzzles in minor ways. But it's all been dumbed down considerably to fit into the on-rails nature of the game. You're along for the ride here as much as you're in control of it, which naturally limits the amount of interactivity the game offers you. You can choose between branching paths here and there, but otherwise you might as well be shooting from a rollercoaster car, albeit a pretty exciting one. There are a few fleeting moments where you can look around freely, but they last only a few seconds each. It's actually pretty hard to pick up a lot of the power-ups due to the way the camera angle whips around in service of a more dramatic presentation.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1095975-ishimura01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1095975\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.7001953125\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:70.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1095975-ishimura01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1095975\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1095975-ishimura01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1095975-ishimura01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Wii or not, this definitely looks like Dead Space.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>At least the game generally makes its limitations work toward a greater good. The camera work is believably frantic (someone watched <i>Cloverfield</i>), and I got the feeling that this is generally how I would jerk my head around if I were embroiled in a monster nightmare of my own. And the game is legitimately nightmarish. Severed heads and limbs--those of the remaining humans, not the monsters--go flying with abandon and the Ishimura is painted with blood. Characters routinely curse out loud, and hey, there's even a naked lady! The point is, this isn't a PG-rated Dead Space just because it's on the Wii. It's almost like the developers went out of their way to drive that point home.<br/> <br/> Extraction presents a quandary. It's a pretty short game, at only five or six hours, and after what looks like a great setup for a big exciting finale, the game just sort of... ends, abruptly and poorly. Since there's a limited amount of interactivity and it's more or less the same each time through, you may not want to play it more than once. But if you're a fan of Dead Space or this sort of, um, \"guided experience,\" you should definitely play it, even if you grab it as a rental or wait for it to hit the bargain bin.

The success of films like <i>28 Days Later</i> and the continued success of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-397\" href=\"/resident-evil/3025-397/\" slug=\"resident-evil\">Resident Evil</a> series have brought <a data-ref-id=\"3015-79\" href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" slug=\"zombie\">zombies</a> back to the forefront of popular culture in a way that's still managing to cause all sorts of zombie fervor across several different mediums. Both things, however, feel like they're just about past the tipping point and have become pretty overexposed. So the release of a dual-joystick shooter where you fight back hordes of zombies almost feels like some sort of cynical commentary on the state of game development, or like someone just sort of gave up and decided to develop the interactive equivalent of the lowest common denominator. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2902\" href=\"/nihilistic-software/3010-2902/\" slug=\"nihilistic-software\">Nihilistic</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25841\" href=\"/zombie-apocalypse/3030-25841/\" slug=\"zombie-apocalypse\">Zombie Apocalypse</a> is that game. It's unimaginative across the board, offering up a boilerplate setting with sub-par gameplay mechanics.<br/> <br/> The one thing that sets Zombie Apocalypse apart from the pack of other dual-joystick games out there is that it can be played by four players simultaneously over the Internet. You don't get that sort of multiplayer out of most downloadable games of this sort, but it only goes so far. The game itself has you pick one of four characters, and then you must survive by blasting your way through wave after wave of zombies. The first few waves only have regular zombies, which will grab you if they can, but you can usually shake them off by rattling the joysticks around a bit. Later waves introduce more dangerous opponents, including (but not limited to) big guys that fall on you immediately without giving you time to struggle, zombies armed with throwing knives, others with shotguns, and still others with explosives. The exploding zombies, which burst after one shot, are especially annoying, because the game's camera angle doesn't always make it easy to judge the distance between you and your target... leading to plenty of cases where you shoot an exploding zombie only to go down with it. Judging distance makes the projectile zombies a bit trickier than they should be, too.<br/> <br/> By default, you're armed with a standard rifle that has a good rate of fire and does a decent amount of damage. Weapon power-ups appear with regularity, giving you access to shotguns, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-45\" href=\"/flamethrower/3055-45/\" slug=\"flamethrower\">flamethrowers</a>, molotov cocktails, a chaingun, a rifle that shoots through multiple targets, and so on. You'll also occasionally get the chance to rescue a survivor, which gives you a teddy bear filled with explosives that, when tossed, draws the attention of nearby zombies. You also have a chainsaw that you can use to clear things out when the horde gets too close, but you're usually fine with your projectile weapons.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/953312-03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-953312\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/953312-03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-953312\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/953312-03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Occasionally you'll be thrown into a dark version of one of the game's seven basic stages.</figcaption></figure>While the game continues on for a lot of levels, there are only seven different areas in the game. So you rotate through these seven stages again and again as the game becomes more difficult. Getting through the game, however, isn't much of a challenge, as running out of lives merely pops up a continue screen, letting you pick up directly where you left off, mid-level. The only penalty is that the game's leaderboards only track games that start on the first level, so continuing your game won't give you a higher score.<br/> <br/> Other than being very cookie-cutter, both in gameplay and in subject matter, the way it cycles through a handful of level designs makes the game look really repetitive, and the game never really feels like it requires much skill. Most deaths seem to come from not noticing a zombie that spawned behind you, or by misjudging the distance on an exploding zombie, but since death doesn't matter much, the game feels like a real drag. Zombies will often spawn all around you, but you have to wait for them to complete their crawling out of the ground animation before your attacks register, which is also a little annoying.<br/> <br/> Zombie Apocalypse is a boring dual-joystick shooter that lacks the speed and intensity that the best games in the genre all share.

It's not some kind of amazing reinvention of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-402\" href=\"/katamari-damacy/3025-402/\" slug=\"katamari-damacy\">Katamari Damacy</a> franchise or anything like that. Heck, it even reuses plenty of levels from the past games in the series. But in these trying times of science-fiction space marines and the world's greatest and most realistic simulation of &lt;insert real-world activity here&gt;, light and goofy moments are few and getting further and further between. Katamari Forever provides plenty of moments like these. It's not tough, but it's smile-inducing fun. It's the feel-good hit of the Fall.<br/> <br/> Katamari Forever is probably best-suited to players who are unfamiliar with the franchise, or, at least, players like myself, who loved the original game but didn't stick with the series. If you're a die-hard Katamari buff, you'll probably recognize more of the reused levels, which will make the game a little less exciting. But the concept remains the same. You use the two analog sticks via a tank-like control scheme to roll a ball around an environment. Items smaller than the ball stick to it, causing the ball to increase in size, which in turn makes it able to pick up larger objects. In its basic form, you're just trying to roll a katamari of a specific size or larger before the time limit expires. But several of the levels play around with the format a bit, such as giving you a burning katamari and forcing you to roll up fuel to keep the fire going as you try to get big enough to torch a specific target. Or another level that uses the katamari as a sponge. You'll soak up water in pools, then use that water to bring life back to a desert. The diversions from the main task of rolling up as much as possible are kind of clever, but the main charm in Katamari Damacy's gameplay comes from seeing some huge thing, and working yourself up until you're big enough to take it with you.<br/> <br/> Backing up all of these rolling activities is another silly story involving the\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3005-425\" href=\"/king-of-all-cosmos/3005-425/\" slug=\"king-of-all-cosmos\">King of All Cosmos</a>.

The human beings are deliberately boxy and weirdly animated. Everything has a deliberately low-poly look to it that just adds to the weird sense of style that permeates the entire product. Many of the King's flashback levels start out in black and white, coloring in as you roll up different items. It's a pretty cool feature.<br/> <br/> Katamari Forever also has online leaderboards and a local two-player option, but the game's at its best when you're just sort of rolling around, semi-aimlessly, grabbing anything and everything in your path. The levels are saddled with time limits that prevent you from grabbing it all, but you can eventually unlock a limit-free mode, as well as another mode that makes your katamari roll super quickly. It's not a huge departure for the series or anything like that, but if you're open to the idea of a new game in the Katamari franchise, you'll find that Katamari Forever fills the void quite well.", "deck": "Katamari Forever doesn't change much about this quirky, long-running series, and you know what?

There are no pretensions toward dramatic gravitas or new gameplay tricks, just a relentless drive to be as exciting, larger-than-life, and fun at every moment as it can possibly be. And you know what? At meeting that particular goal, this is the single most successful game I've ever played.<br/> <br/><a data-ref-id=\"3010-827\" href=\"/naughty-dog-inc/3010-827/\" slug=\"naughty-dog-inc\">  Naughty Dog</a> has improved on every single aspect of the first <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13992\" href=\"/uncharted-drakes-fortune/3030-13992/\" slug=\"uncharted-drakes-fortune\"> Uncharted</a>, a game that built a great blueprint out of components taken from other properties--<a data-ref-id=\"3030-20662\" href=\"/gears-of-war-2/3030-20662/\" slug=\"gears-of-war-2\"> Gears of War</a>'s cover-based shooting, gymnastic traversal a la <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20694\" href=\"/tomb-raider-underworld/3030-20694/\" slug=\"tomb-raider-underworld\"> Tomb Raider</a>, the swashbuckling treasure-hunting of <i><a data-ref-id=\"3005-1424\" href=\"/indiana-jones/3005-1424/\" slug=\"indiana-jones\"> </a></i><i>Indiana Jones</i>--but then failed to add those parts up to a whole that surpassed its own inspirations. Uncharted 2 fulfills all of that potential and then some, with better drama, better shooting, better graphics, better moments. Better <i>everything</i>. It's not that this game does anything particularly new, it just does what it does with a higher degree of presentation and polish than just about anything on the market.<br/> <br/> Uncharted 2 turns on the strength of its story and characters; none of the game's numerous mechanical improvements would mean much if <a data-ref-id=\"3005-162\" href=\"/nathan-drake/3005-162/\" slug=\"nathan-drake\"> Nathan Drake</a>, equal parts Indy and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2143\" href=\"/john-mcclane/3005-2143/\" slug=\"john-mcclane\"> John McClane</a>, weren't such a relatable and likable guy. Tough-talking but good-hearted, the guy absorbs an inhuman amount of physical punishment in every scene, and does it with a smirk and a one-liner.

Then there's the game's best new character <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8982\" href=\"/chloe-frazer/3005-8982/\" slug=\"chloe-frazer\"> Chloe Frazer</a>, the sultry, husky-voiced thief who has an eye for Drake but whose motivations are never completely clear. She serves as one-third of the most believable love triangle I can remember seeing in games, a medium that isn't exactly known for its realistic depictions of romance.<br/> <br/> The story here has the crew hitting locations like Turkey, Borneo, and Nepal as they retrace the steps of Marco Polo in a search for the mythical kingdom of Shambhala and a priceless Buddhist artifact thought to be hidden there. The premise is pretty boilerplate treasure-hunting stuff, and best serves as a vehicle for the wonderful interactions you get between the characters, which must have been facilitated by the recording of the voiceover and motion data simultaneously between the actors while they were in the same room together.\u00a0The result is, these characters also feel like they're in the same place together, riffing off of each other, responding to body language or a raised eyebrow, genuinely interacting. It all feels about as real as I've seen in video game cinematics, and though the lines aren't the work of Shakespeare (and don't need to be), they achieve exactly the sort of tone and emotional response you need to appreciate this sort of lighthearted action story.<br/> <br/> You do need some interesting ways to occupy yourself in between expository cutscenes, of course, and this is where Uncharted 2 feels both the most improved over its predecessor and the most impressive in its own right. I have to mention the gigantic setpiece action moments right upfront, because those are the scenes that will stick with you long after you've finished the story. You're engaged in a pitched gunbattle on top of a speeding train. You're frantically fleeing down a tight alleyway from a pursuing jeep. You're playing cat-and-mouse with a tank that's methodically obliterating every piece of cover around you. You are continuing to trade fire with enemies inside a building that, under a hail of missiles and gunfire, is <i>quite literally collapsing around you</i>.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1169006-1043375_955125_20090602_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1169006\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1169006-1043375_955125_20090602_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1169006\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1169006-1043375_955125_20090602_screen001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1169006-1043375_955125_20090602_screen001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Get ready to trot the globe!</figcaption></figure>You're in control of all these moments. The sorts of action scenes that other games might relegate to prerendered video are the bread and butter of Uncharted 2's most exciting playable sequences, and they come at you frequently. Sure, plenty of games before this one have dropped you into similar impossible scenarios, but they've rarely done so with the sort of cinematic flair that colors nearly every minute of Uncharted 2. You get the sense that some designer at Naughty Dog studied every minute of this game intently throughout production, constantly asking \"How can we make this part more awesome?\" It feels like there's no end of inventive camera moves and angles, unexpected special effects, and smart, directed visual design all drawing your attention to exactly how incredible the action is. These sorts of thrills are hard to describe in words; you need to see them yourself to get the effect. But to show them to you would be to rob you of the joy of playing them firsthand. So all I can say to you is: Play this game. You won't be disappointed.<br/> <br/>On a more basic mechanical level, I should note it's actually a ton of fun to shoot at and punch people in this game, in contrast to the first game where the shooting sometimes felt laborious and the melee combat was awkward. The shooting has been tightened up considerably in the sequel, with more and better guns, some much-needed changes to the grenade-throwing, and enemies that don't soak up a dozen bullets before they finally go down. The melee combat has been made simultaneously easier to handle and flashier--Drake has a huge number of hand-to-hand ways to take down enemies--and sneaking around to take out enemies stealthily is actually a viable option in a number of scenarios. Rather than an obstacle to unfolding the story, Uncharted 2's combat is a highlight of the game.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1169007-961958_74201420090427_150719_3_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1169007\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56194690265487\" data-width=\"904\" style=\"width: 904px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1169007-961958_74201420090427_150719_3_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1169007\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1169007-961958_74201420090427_150719_3_big.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1169007-961958_74201420090427_150719_3_big.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The multiplayer adds a ton of longevity to the game.</figcaption></figure>It's good enough to support a surprisingly robust multiplayer mode, anyway. With its cover-based setup, Uncharted 2 multiplayer ends up feeling a bit like Gears of War, with a similar priority on fighting up-close, melee attacks, and grenades. But the traversal mechanics from the campaign carry over here to let you climb, crawl, and shimmy your way up and down the maps, giving you more mobility than you'd ever see out of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-180\" href=\"/marcus-fenix/3005-180/\" slug=\"marcus-fenix\"> Marcus Fenix</a> and enabling some quick escapes during intense action.<br/> <br/> I had the most fun with the game's cooperative modes. These are limited to three players, which I'd like to think was due to a conscious design decision and not technical limitations. The arena is the best, rawest demonstration of the game's combat, as it subjects your team to 10 increasingly harrowing rounds of encroaching enemies in the style of Gears' horde mode. There are also three standalone co-op scenarios adapted from the single-player (each with their own brief cinematics and unique voiceover) that let you fight tons and tons of AI enemies while moving from point A to B, rather than holing up in a single defensible position, as you do in the arena. Both modes are a blast, and can get painfully, ridiculously busy and difficult at the higher levels. But it's a good sort of hurt.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1169008-1111487_t_uncharted2at_e309_snowb_v2_hd_063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1169008\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1169008-1111487_t_uncharted2at_e309_snowb_v2_hd_063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1169008\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1169008-1111487_t_uncharted2at_e309_snowb_v2_hd_063.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1169008-1111487_t_uncharted2at_e309_snowb_v2_hd_063.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0It's Drake against the world.</figcaption></figure>There's plenty of great competitive multiplayer in here too, with a number of small-team objective modes based on the sorts of game types you see in most multiplayer games, focusing on delivering an item to a capture location and that sort of thing. The online mode has a full character progression system a la Call of Duty that lets you rank up and access weapon upgrades, new character skins, and \"boosters\" (perks) that modify all sorts of little variables in your gameplay, like reload speeds and how much experience you gain. The multiplayer progression is really smartly designed, with separate upgrades that go toward the competitive and cooperative modes, so you can specialize in the game types you like playing more. These upgrades are in addition to the typical single-player unlockables you get with a Naughty Dog game, including new character models, visual filters, and some nicely produced behind-the-scenes videos. This is an incredibly complete package, overall.<br/> <br/>I'd have to reach to offer any significant criticisms of this game, because none readily present themselves. You might end up ducking behind the wrong cover or grabbing the wrong handhold once in a while, I guess. (There, are you happy?) Naughty Dog set out with a very specific goal in mind, and in focusing intently on that goal, they blew right past it.

It's contrived as all hell, but it's got the perfect structure for a video game. That it's rendered in polygons takes some of the squirmy edge off the torture-porn aspect of  Saw, but it still delivers on the free-floating sadism and grim machinery that are hallmarks of the series. More importantly, as much graphic death as there is in the game, it spends most of its time focusing on very contained puzzle-solving rather than combat, making it feel atypical for a horror game. There are a few neat tricks here, but it starts recycling them almost immediately, and the diminishing returns set in just as quickly.<br/><br/>The game takes place between the first two  <i>Saw</i> movies, putting you in the role of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11383\" href=\"/detective-david-tapp/3005-11383/\" slug=\"detective-david-tapp\">      Detective Tapp</a>, the man who obsessively pursued Jigsaw in the first film. Here he's been kidnapped and stuck deep inside a dilapidated insane asylum that Jigsaw has converted into giant, elaborate testing ground, with the stated purpose of trying to save Tapp from his own obsession with trying to catch Jigsaw. In order to save himself, Tapp has to first save a series of other Jigsaw victims, many of whom are somehow intertwined with Tapp's obsession. With an impossible number of conveniently placed TV sets, that creepy little doll, and his brutally monotone voice, Jigsaw guides you through the labyrinthine asylum, subjecting you to all manner of grotesquery as you try and save each victim, such as plunging your hand into toilets filled with dirty needles and barrels of acid to retrieve keys.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1168672-05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1168672\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"576\" style=\"width: 576px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1168672-05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1168672\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1168672-05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0That puppet is seriously the creepiest thing to ride a tricycle.</figcaption></figure>  One of the most common trap designs is to put you in a room with some kind of threat--most often a bunch of explosives or a toxic gas--and then put a limit on how long you have to get out of your predicament. You'll occasionally have to cull some clues from the environment around you, but most of the puzzle-solving gets done through puzzley little minigames. You'll match tumblers to pick door locks, power up electrical panels and shut off ventilation systems with puzzles that are somewhat reminiscent of the hacking minigames from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-17280\" href=\"/bioshock/3030-17280/\" slug=\"bioshock\">     BioShock</a>, and place different-sized gears on pegs to open mechanical puzzle boxes. Once you get to the people you're trying to save from some elaborate, painful death, you'll do more of the same. These \u201cboss fights,\u201d as it were, are the real highlights of Saw, and I consistently found myself failing them on purpose just to see the bloody end results. It's more than a little perverse that, without the nasty context, the puzzles you're undertaking couldn't be more innocuous. <br/><br/>While the puzzles and the atmosphere are the primary focus in Saw, there is still some one-on-one combat, which is easily one of the game's least compelling components. In theory, though, it's pitch-perfect for Saw. The asylum is filled with other desperate, violent people whose only chance for escape lies in a key that Jigsaw has surgically implanted inside Tapp's body.

But it all falls apart when it's time to actually fight a guy, simply because the controls are so unbelievably unresponsive. It's possible to take an enemy out with a single, brutal attack, and there's a queasy satisfaction to that. But if you don't get the jump on your opponent, the recovery time from being attacked is so long that it's easy to get caught in a loop that ends in your death. There are occasions when you can use Jigsaw's traps against your enemies, or avoid combat altogether, which is definitely preferable.<br/><br/>The bigger picture problem with Saw, though, is that it's got a handful of clever ideas, but it exhausts most of them in the first hour or so, and you spend the rest of the game playing the same puzzles and performing the same tasks over and over. The puzzles get a little tougher, but beyond that, they never really change. The game tries to keep the tension up between puzzles by livening up your path with narrow balance beams set over serrated pits and random tripwires attached to shotguns, the latter of which can be a particular and sudden source of frustration. These threats mostly just force you to move through the game at a more methodical pace, and the more time you spend in this dirty, scary, extremely contrived place full of psychopaths and deadly machinations, the more accustomed you become to its particular rhythms, and the less unnerving it is.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>The game puts on a pretty good facade, affecting many of Saw's stylistic flares. There's lots of jarring camera shake, motion blur, and patchy focus effects, and the soundtrack is all industrial clangs and squeals, but in the end it's all window-dressing for a game that has more in common with <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1096\" href=\"/professor-layton/3025-1096/\" slug=\"professor-layton\">    Professor Layton</a> than <a data-ref-id=\"3025-104\" href=\"/condemned/3025-104/\" slug=\"condemned\">   Condemned</a>.", "deck": "Saw captures the rusty, sadistic aesthetic of the films well enough, though like the series, the longer it goes on, the less interesting it is.

It's never made explicitly clear what happened to Nana, but I like to assume that rather than pass away she got sick of Sofi's innocent charm and ditched her to join a rough-and-tumble biker gang. <br/><br/>At the top of each level you'll see one of Sofi's drawings, detailing her longing for life with her grandmother, and at the end you'll get a postcard from Nana reminding Sofi how great and strong she is. At first it's really cute, especially when combined with the excellent visuals. By the end though, you want nothing more than Sofi's parents to have a long talk with her about loss, before those therapy bills begin to pile up.<br/><br/>The gameplay comes in the form of helping Sofi through the story's three acts as she ambles her way towards the end of each level. To accomplish this task, you'll place different items in her path as she casually walks from the start of the area to its finish. Sofi will move at a regular pace from left to right, though the items you use to help her are presented to you randomly. You'll get things like steps, planks, bombs, and fans to place on the screen, and Sofi will constantly be climbing, bouncing, and floating based upon their placement.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4511/1131402-lucidity_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1131402\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4511/1131402-lucidity_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1131402\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4511/1131402-lucidity_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0You'll choose how best to cross this gap.</figcaption></figure>  Each item has a particular use, though since the order in which they are given to you is random, you'll be combining them in different ways to ensure Sofi's safety. This adds a frantic element to a game that otherwise enjoys a very metered pace. You're able to queue, or hold, one item in reserve, but with no ability to discard an inappropriate item you may find yourself filling the screen with useless staircases until you get that bomb you need to blast through an impasse. This can get frustrating in the back half of the game where getting caught against a wall for too long will mean Sofi's demise and a restart of the level. Sofi will also restart a level if she is hit or takes damage more than once, though you can reset your hit counter by collecting any of the many fireflies that are strewn about. <br/><br/>There isn't much variety to the types of items that you'll eventually have at your disposal, but learning how Sofi interacts with each is key to successfully navigating the game. Knowing that a fan will lift you up and one space to the right is essential to placing the next fan ahead of time. You have no direct control over the camera, so you won't be able to plan too far in advance, something that seems to be less of an intentional gameplay constraint and more of a frustration. The ability to speed up Sofi's pace for certain sections, instead of waiting on her deliberate plodding, would have also been a welcome addition. With the limited amount of control in the player's hands, you may find yourself more relieved at reaching the end of a level than satisfied.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5353/1165746-lucidity_16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1165746\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"1.4095063985375\" data-width=\"1641\" style=\"width: 1641px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:141.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5353/1165746-lucidity_16.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1165746\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5353/1165746-lucidity_16.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5353/1165746-lucidity_16.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The game really shines through its art.</figcaption></figure>  The game isn't very long, and you'll find yourself making through the three acts in a few hours.

Collecting them can definitely be a chore, especially considering the random nature in which items are presented to you, but it does give you a reason to replay levels multiple times. <br/><br/>With its absolutely exquisite art design, yet middling gameplay, Lucidity presents a package that initially captivates but wears thin quickly.

There's a reverence here, not necessarily for the reality of heavy metal, but for the gleaming, violent, sexy, and well,  <i>brutal</i> power fantasy that a wicked Judas Priest album cover, and the contents within it, might inspire in a 13-year-old boy. And while heavy metal has a tendency to be pretty self-serious, Brutal Legend is anything but, taking all of the demonic imagery, S&amp;M gear, hot-rod fetishism, closeted druidic fixations, and ultra-macho barbarian warriors, and blowing it out to its logical and absurd extreme. This is, far and away, Brutal Legend's biggest strength: its ability to be both giddily ridiculous and fist-pumpingly badass, often in the very same moment. <br/><br/>The gameplay, on the other hand, seems like a really odd fit for the subject matter. Brutal Legend goes in several different directions at once, trying to be a third-person action adventure game, an exploration-based, open-world driving game, and an action-oriented real-time strategy game in pretty much equal parts. Those parts aren't as fleshed-out and fun as they ought to be, and they don't always mesh together terrifically, either. Points are given for Brutal Legend's gameplay ambitions, and while it's never out-and-out bad, I often felt like I was tolerating the gameplay so I could savor the rich atmosphere and fast wit that carries it.<br/><br/>After a clever meta-intro featuring <a data-ref-id=\"3040-77784\" href=\"/jack-black/3040-77784/\" slug=\"jack-black\">         Jack Black</a> in a record store, Brutal Legend tells the story of legendary roadie <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4311\" href=\"/eddie-riggs/3005-4311/\" slug=\"eddie-riggs\">        Eddie Riggs</a>. He's the best at what he does, even when he's doing it for the snot-nosed, pierced-lipped, text-messaging poseurs currently sullying the sacred name of metal. Eddie's a man out of time, a leather-and-denim-clad road warrior that longs for a time when music was \u201creal,\u201d like the '70s, or the  <i>early</i> '70s. So, when a nasty on-stage calamity ends up transporting Eddie to a fantasy realm that looks like a heavy metal album cover, or the last part of the movie  <i>Heavy Metal</i>, come to life, he kind of just rolls with it. The world of Brutal Legend is a most fascinating pastiche of all things metal. It's a heavy metal fantasy, but one in which heavy metal music and culture as we know it exists as well, so it's not uncommon to see a thick-necked headbanger doing battle with some prickly, dangerous-looking beast. <br/><br/>     Riggs teams up with a small band of humans living under the oppressive boot-heel of the behorned emperor <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11960\" href=\"/doviculus/3005-11960/\" slug=\"doviculus\">       Doviculus</a> and his general, the lycra-and-leopard-print-clad glam rocker <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11952\" href=\"/general-lionwhyte/3005-11952/\" slug=\"general-lionwhyte\">      LionWhyte</a>, and quickly finds that his skills as a roadie can be rather handy when it comes to waging an epic battle against the forces of darkness, which ends up more or less resembling a massive arena rock tour. The greatest joy I got out of Brutal Legend came from watching Eddie Riggs calmly acclimate to a foreign land that's still weirdly familiar to him during the first few hours of the game. The game definitely gets a little bit distracted by its own very dense and very metal mythology as it goes on, but that's countered by a simple and surprisingly sweet love story, and the narrative manages to stay engaging throughout. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042873-943672_20090601_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042873\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042873-943672_20090601_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042873\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042873-943672_20090601_screen001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0If only KISS actually looked like this... </figcaption></figure> I came into Brutal Legend kind of expecting Jack Black to be a bit of a liability as the voice of Eddie Riggs. Jack Black often has a hard time playing anything other than Jack Black, and it would've been easy for him to play Riggs as a loud-talking heavy-metal goofball, but he actually reins it in rather nicely, bringing just the right amount of working-man's matter-of-fact-ness to the role. Besides Black, the game's voice cast is packed with heavy metal luminaries, often playing quasi-biographical versions of themselves, most notably with <a data-ref-id=\"3040-54078\" href=\"/ozzy-osbourne/3040-54078/\" slug=\"ozzy-osbourne\">     Ozzy Osbourne</a> as the game's merchant, and Motorhead frontman <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10290\" href=\"/lemmy/3005-10290/\" slug=\"lemmy\">    Lemmy Kilmister</a> as a shaman-type character called the Killmaster. Comedian and noted metalhead Brian Posehn also makes an appropriately baffling appearance as a master hunter, and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-3245\" href=\"/tim-curry/3040-3245/\" slug=\"tim-curry\">   Tim Curry</a> kills it as Doviculus, bringing just the right amount of measured British malevolence to the role. The voice-work is consistently solid, though a fair amount of credit is due to the game's animations for bringing all the characters to life. I wouldn't call anything about Brutal Legend subtle, but there's an expressive quality to the meaty, caricatured faces in the game that really helps sell the dialogue.<br/> <br/> While it wastes no time getting the story going, Brutal Legend eases you ever-so-slowly into its gameplay. The game starts off resembling a third-person action adventure game, with Riggs cutting down evil druids and freaky nun demons with his oversized battle axe and his trusty guitar Clementine, the latter of which shoots bolts of lightning at enemies when played. You can use the two weapons in concert to create a variety of combos, and you can unlock more of them as you progress. It's not long before Eddie assembles the Druid Plow (AKA The Deuce), a Big Daddy Roth-looking hot rod--complete with flames and an 8-ball gearshift--which you can use to travel from one mission to the next, and to generally explore the world as you please. Once you're out in the open, your guitar can also be used to perform solos, which can have effects ranging from unearthing hidden artifacts to summoning your car. As stunning and full of detail as the world is, the game doesn't provide enough motivation to go out and explore it. There are a number of side missions you can choose to take on, which will earn you money that you can use to upgrade The Deuce, your axe, and your guitar, but there's a real dearth of variety to the missions. Ambushing enemy troops and checkpoint-racing AI opponents repeatedly gets monotonous fast, and on the normal difficulty, Brutal Legend isn't hard enough to require additional upgrades, so it's easy to just stick with the story missions.<br/><br/>      The game eventually grants you the ability to command other troops around, starting off with the grunts in your burgeoning army, the headbangers, whom you can give basic orders using the D pad. Later missions introduce you to additional units, like the Razor Girls, blow-dried, feathered-haired rocker chicks who have a basic ranged attack, and the comically big-handed bouncers, who serve as heavier melee muscle. Everything leads up to the stage shows, which is where Brutal Legend becomes a full-blown RTS. Though it's relatively streamlined, there's still resource management, tech tree upgrades, and nine different types of units to deploy, each with their own specific and unique strengths and weaknesses. You can still hack and slash away at enemies from the ground level during these large-scale battles, though Eddie can also sprout wings and fly, giving you a very necessary bird's-eye view of the battlefield. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042547-ironheades_tour_bus_of_destruction_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042547\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042547-ironheades_tour_bus_of_destruction_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042547\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042547-ironheades_tour_bus_of_destruction_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042547-ironheades_tour_bus_of_destruction_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0You can't go on tour without a proper tour bus! </figcaption></figure> The game introduces new mechanics and units all the way to the very end, but I found that the more involved the gameplay became, the less fun the overall experience was. Real-time strategy is a genre that has struggled more than any other to adapt to the limitations of console controls, and Brutal Legend is not the game to crack that particular code. I just felt like the controller couldn't keep up with the relatively frantic pace of the action, and trying to juggle the third-person and real-time strategy combat at the same time was a struggle. Also, for as much time as the game spends trying to acclimate you to the ins and outs of the stage shows, there are significant, meaningful mechanics, such as the ability to mount the stage directly for some last-ditch defense, that barely get mentioned. It seems pretty bold of Double Fine to incorporate such vastly different gameplay mechanics into a single game, though there's also the sense that perhaps there wasn't enough confidence in any one piece to let it carry the whole game.<br/><br/>In a way, the single-player game--which, if you stick strictly to the story missions, can be knocked out in around four hours--almost feels like a lengthy tutorial for the multiplayer, which breaks the RTS element out onto its own. In addition to the Eddie Riggs-led army of Ironheade, you can also lead Doviculus' fleshy, abominable army into battle, as well as the pale, gothy army of the Drowning Doom. There's a good variety of maps that you can play online with, but the same fundamental issues I have with the single-player stage battles still apply here, and without the story there to hook me in, I didn't feel terribly compelled to revisit it.<br/><br/>Brutal Legend is an intense, unique, and fairly bumpy ride, one that puts developer Double Fine's strengths and weaknesses in pretty sharp relief. The vision of this heavy metal dream world is strikingly rendered, and the comic timing is some of the best you'll find in a video game. The gameplay, as singular a combination of gameplay styles as it is, suffers from being a jack of all trades and master of none. Like most teenage metalheads, this game has got issues, but if you're willing to look past some very uneven gameplay, Brutal Legend will rock you.  <i>Hard.</i>", "deck": "The heavy metal fantasy world of Brutal Legend and the characters that populate it are far more well-realized and engaging than the ambitious-but-flawed gameplay.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-214/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20700/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/brutal-legend/3030-20700/", "id": 20700, "name": "Br\u00fctal Legend"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-10-13 21:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73327/", "id": 73327, "name": "Br\u00fctal Legend"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/forza-motorsport-3-review/1900-215/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3886/1167153-cod_day7_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1167153\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.50461538461538\" data-width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3886/1167153-cod_day7_4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1167153\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3886/1167153-cod_day7_4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The game offers a few different camera styles, including a cockpit view.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-24995\" href=\"/forza-motorsport-3/3030-24995/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport-3\"> Forza Motorsport 3</a> is a game for people who love cars not just for their looks, but also for the way they drive. At its core is a satisfying simulation of realistic car handling with all of the tuning bells and whistles that fans of this style of game would expect. But the impressive part is that Forza 3 provides all of this while also finding a way to remain appealing for people who might love cars, but might not have a love for the extreme challenge that a full-on driving simulation entails. With loads of enthralling things to do both on and off the track, Forza Motorsport 3 is like a new blueprint for how racing games like this should work.<br/> <br/> Like the previous game in the series, Forza 3 widens its appeal by offering a handful of assists that make keeping your car on the track and pointing in the right direction a bit easier. Most of these are actually standard car features, like traction and stability control, and anti-lock brakes. This time, though, you can also enable an automatic braking assist that will slow into the curves for you. With everything turned on, all you're really doing is feathering the accelerator and pointing the nose of your car at the dynamic driving line, and it practically plays itself. That said, there's no button you can push or slider you can tune to turn Forza 3 into <a data-ref-id=\"3025-396\" href=\"/ridge-racer/3025-396/\" slug=\"ridge-racer\"> Ridge Racer</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-76\" href=\"/burnout/3025-76/\" slug=\"burnout\"> Burnout</a>, or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-483\" href=\"/need-for-speed/3025-483/\" slug=\"need-for-speed\"> Need For Speed</a>.

Though I started with most of the assists turned on, over time I became more and more comfortable with the handling and slowly turned them off.<br/> <br/> There's one more thing in place that attempts to make the driving in Forza more palatable to people who might normally ignore a game like this. At any point, you can hit the back button to rewind the race. It's similar to the flashback feature found in <a data-ref-id=\"3010-491\" href=\"/codemasters/3010-491/\" slug=\"codemasters\"> Codemasters</a>' <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20729\" href=\"/grid/3030-20729/\" slug=\"grid\"> GRID</a>, but here there's no limit to how frequently you rewind the race. Any time you blow a corner and completely destroy your car, you can hit the back button and give it another shot. The only real penalty is that your leaderboard position is lowered below the folks that were able to run a clean race. It sounds like the sort of thing that totally breaks any challenge the game might have, and yes, it certainly makes for a nice cushion when you get too aggressive and screw up. But when I think back to the times in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5881\" href=\"/forza-motorsport-2/3030-5881/\" slug=\"forza-motorsport-2\"> Forza 2</a> when I raced a long, long endurance race only to lose focus near the end and blow my lead--and how that made me never want to play Forza 2 ever again--rewinding a race doesn't feel like it destroys the experience. Sure, you can undo a wreck, but you'll still have to do all that driving yourself. Even with all of the assists on, it's not going to take that corner for you.<br/> <br/> The single-player component of Forza 3 guides you through multiple seasons of racing, each of which lets you go through different groups of races that are designed for different cars and classes. In this season mode, you're always presented with a few different choices to serve as a next step. The choices you're offered depend on the car you're driving and the tracks you've seen, so after you complete a series you're given choices that let you see tracks you haven't seen before, one that lets you keep on racing in your current car, or one that's built for a different car, giving you an excuse to get a new ride. With each series having its own little poster and set of rules, they each take on a little bit of personality of their own.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4045/1154125-cod_day5_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1154125\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.46\" data-width=\"650\" style=\"width: 650px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:46.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4045/1154125-cod_day5_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1154125\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4045/1154125-cod_day5_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0There are plenty of full-on race vehicles awaiting you... once you've earned enough credits to buy them.</figcaption></figure>Though completing seasons is a good, guided way to move through the events, you can also just call up the event list at any time and see every single series the game has to offer. There are 220 different series in the game, and provided you have the appropriate car for the event and enough experience points to enter, you can jump into any race of any series at any time, season be damned. This is great if you want to seek out specific events as an excuse to drive a specific car. And there are a lot of specific cars that you'll probably want to drive over the course of the game.<br/> <br/> There are over 400 cars in the game from 53 different manufacturers, bringing together sensible vehicles like the 2009 Honda Fit Sport (which can get up to decent speeds if you pump it full of upgrades), older cars like the '87 Buick Grand National or the '70 Mustang Boss 429, newer production vehicles like the '09 Lexus IS F, supercars like the '09 Bugatti Veyron, and straight-up race cars with names like \"1998 Ferrari #30 MOMO Doran Racing F333 SP.\" You can carefully spend your credits on individual upgrades for each car, or you can skip all that and use the new quick upgrade system, which lets you choose which class you want to put your car into and then figures out what parts you'll need to get there and how much it'll cost.<br/> <br/> You can also drive online with up to seven other players. The default matchmaking options are Halo-like in their construction, allowing you to pick specific race type playlists (like drift or circuit) or letting you hit quick match to get matched up in standard races of varying lengths. Once you're in a lobby, you can vote to skip races and select which car you want to drive, like customized rides out of your garage or off-the-lot stock versions of the game's full complement of vehicles. If you're playing with friends, you can jump into private races, which gives you full control over a ton of different options. There's the obvious stuff, like the track or the number of laps, but you can also specify teams, choose different types of scoring, car restrictions, and more. You can also set up drift races, which score you on how well you can whip around turns, rather than your ability to finish first. You can save your own rule variants for later use, which is handy.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/1170766-forza3_storefront_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1170766\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56103286384977\" data-width=\"1278\" style=\"width: 1278px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/1170766-forza3_storefront_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1170766\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/1170766-forza3_storefront_01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/1170766-forza3_storefront_01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The storefront lets you find all kinds of cool user-generated stuff.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Of course, there's way more to Forza 3 than just racing. Forza 2 allowed players to use primitive shapes to design elaborate vinyls and slap them all over cars. The designs got absolutely crazy, and players started auctioning off well-designed cars via an in-game auction house. Forza 3 has all of that stuff, but it's been further fleshed out to allow for player-run storefronts. Now, rather than simply auctioning off fully designed cars, players can sell groups of vinyls, full car designs, and tuning setups. You can also put up photos or edited videos. If you're skilled with the vinyl tools or tuning, this seems like it could be a good way to stack up in-game credits, which you can then turn around and spend on the game's high-end cars. Just sifting through the design area and seeing what other users have come up with is almost like a game unto itself.<br/> <br/> The look and sound of Forza Motorsport 3 is really fantastic. The car models look great and show off a lot of detail, and more importantly, they move well. The game maintains a smooth frame rate throughout. The menus, most of which show off a stark-white design, are clean, easy to understand, and feel like an interactive car brochure. The audio is awesome, with realistic-sounding exhausts and tire squeals. There's a licensed soundtrack in place, as well, which plays Hard-Fi, The Hives, Rise Against, Adam Freeland, Turbonegro, Logistics, and more. The soothing music that plays during the menus is great, but during races, I found that the music repeated a little too frequently. You may want to build a custom soundtrack if you're planning on spending some serious time with Forza 3.<br/> <br/> It's extremely easy to lose hours to Forza Motorsport 3 because it does so much great stuff both on and off the track.

Totally tower defense.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>A tower defense game based on <i>South Park</i> sounds like it could be a predictable, lazy product, don't you think? Take a well established and arguably overused gameplay blueprint and use it to slap a licensed property onto Xbox Live Arcade, then call it a day. I guess it's surprising, then, that the aptly titled <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23102\" href=\"/south-park-lets-go-tower-defense-play/3030-23102/\" slug=\"south-park-lets-go-tower-defense-play\">South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!</a> doesn't feel shoddy or half-baked after all. It's both a fully competent tower defense game and, despite a lack of any new animation, a good vehicle for <i>South Park</i>'s ridiculous brand of humor as well.<br/> <br/> In a way, Xbox Live Arcade sort of has its own version of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12764\" href=\"/pixeljunk-monsters/3030-12764/\" slug=\"pixeljunk-monsters\">PixelJunk Monsters</a> now. That game extended the standard tower defense concept by turning your abstract cursor--the thing you use to determine where you build different sorts of towers--into an actual character. But all that character could really do was pick up money dropped from enemies, which you then spent on more towers. This South Park game further extends that concept by giving you not one but four onscreen characters who can build towers, and it also gives those characters an attack.<br/> <br/> Guess who those initial four characters are? Right--Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman, all of whom can throw snowballs at enemies. You can also charge up the snowballs to make them yellow (and more powerful), and each character has a special attack that damages all the enemies onscreen, spawns a bunch of bonus money, amps your attack power, and so on. There are a ton of other playable characters you can unlock from the series too, from Jimmy and Clyde to Bebe and, yeah, Timmy. They all have their own tasteless specials that involve things like crutches and colostomy bags. (Yep, definitely South Park.) The characters are all different enough from each other in terms of speed, power, special abilities, and voiceovers to make them all at least worth messing around with.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1110499-scrapbook_enemies.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1110499\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1110499-scrapbook_enemies.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1110499\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1110499-scrapbook_enemies.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There's plenty of trademark characters in here.\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure>South Park is generally playable by yourself, but you have to switch between the characters on the fly, which gets almost unreasonably fast-paced and difficult on the normal setting by the end of the game's 11 normal levels. The best way to play it is with two (or three or four) people each controlling different characters, which lets each character build towers, collect coins, and throw snowballs independently. Characters who aren't currently selected will at least throw snowballs on their own, so you can use them as mobile towers, but they won't move themselves out of danger or charge their snowballs up. The easy setting is much more forgiving, however, and it won't affect your achievements or completion of the game. So if you're having trouble, there's no shame in admitting defeat and dropping the difficulty level.<br/> <br/> Mechanically, this is tower defense through and through. The enemies run the gamut of antagonist groups from the series, including terrorists, sixth graders, hippies, homeless people, Scott Tenorman, the dreaded Christmas critters, and, yes, crab people. (Craaaab people, craaaab people.) As per the genre's standards, each is weak to different kinds of towers, which include baseball launchers, and the Pee-tron, a mounted contraption that sprays cat urine. I hear that stuff can get you high. You can build walls out of snow to create lanes for the enemies to wander through, exposing them to your towers for longer. That's what this genre is all about, and South Park does a perfectly adequate job of it.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1110491-cutscene_art.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1110491\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1110491-cutscene_art.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1110491\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1110491-cutscene_art.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1110491-cutscene_art.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>These stills are a fine vehicle for South Park's absurd humor.</figcaption></figure>Given the extremely short production time on episodes of South Park, it's a little disappointing there's no new animation in this game. But there's a huge amount of original voiceover for all of the characters, and the story is told with a graphic novel style of still frames that gets the job done pretty well, especially with all of the new dialogue. The ridiculous story, which basically just moves you from one familiar South Park location to the next, affords the appearance of some peripheral series favorites like Jimbo and the owner of City Wok, who has erected a Great City Wall around town. (Listening to him scream frantically about defending his City Wall had me in stitches, but maybe I'm just easily amused.) It's all funny, ludicrous stuff that makes you assume <a data-ref-id=\"3040-34105\" href=\"/trey-parker/3040-34105/\" slug=\"trey-parker\">Trey Parker</a> must have had a hand in the story, because it feels authentic. (He appears to have only been an executive producer, though.) You can at least unlock a ton of video clips of some of the show's finer moments, and there's plenty of the series' trademark humor all over this game, even if there isn't any new footage to look at.<br/> <br/>Realistically, you'd need to be a fan of either <i>South Park</i> or tower defense to get the most out of this game. If you've got an interest in either subject--or, ideally, both--there are much worse ways to spend 800 points on Xbox Live Arcade. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "Almost in spite of itself, this is both a solid tower defense game and a good piece of fan service for South Park fans.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-216/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23102/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/south-park-lets-go-tower-defense-play/3030-23102/", "id": 23102, "name": "South Park Let's Go Tower Defense Play!"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-10-16 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-86619/", "id": 86619, "name": "South Park"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/borderlands-review/1900-217/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/59380/1155243-battle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1155243\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/5/59380/1155243-battle.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1155243\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/5/59380/1155243-battle.jpg\"></a><figcaption>How do you reason with a guy that sets himself on fire?\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Mashing together different game genres is risky business. For every game that manages to do it correctly, three or four more seem to miss out on key pieces of the different genres they're attempting to combine. The end result has been a lot of games that feature really unsatisfying first-person shooting because they're trying to focus on too many different genres at once. With that in mind, perhaps the most exciting thing about <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\" href=\"/gearbox-software-llc/3010-1615/\" slug=\"gearbox-software-llc\"> Gearbox</a>'s new FPS-meets-RPG, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\" href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/\" slug=\"borderlands\"> Borderlands</a>, is that the action is actually quite fun on its own, offering loads of different guns to try out and a lot of different ways to eliminate anything and everything that stands in your way.<br/> <br/> Borderlands is a loot-driven first-person shooter with a lot of different role-playing game hooks throughout. The game is structured a bit like an MMO, with the world broken out into different zones and a very handy quest log that feels like it fell out of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\" href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" slug=\"world-of-warcraft\"> World of Warcraft</a>. There are plenty of critical story-related missions to complete, but there are also a lot of side-quests that send you across every zone, usually to kill or collect something. It's easy to see the influence of games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-148\" href=\"/diablo/3025-148/\" slug=\"diablo\"> Diablo</a> on Borderlands, as well, because the game is constantly dropping procedurally generated items for you to collect. This is how the game's box is able to claim that it has \"bazillions\" of guns.<br/> <br/> Of course, \"bazillions\" is a pretty high (and pretty made-up) number, and you'll probably never see the exact same gun twice. But much of the variety in the guns come from slight statistical tweaks to how much damage they do, their rate of fire, their reload speed, whether or not they have a scope, and so on. But the weapons still break down into a handful of traditional classes, like combat rifle, sub-machine gun, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\"> sniper rifle</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\"> rocket launcher</a>, pistol, revolver, and so on. And as you start finding better weapons and becoming proficient with them, it quickly feels like 95 percent of the guns you're finding are nothing more than vendor trash that only exists to be sold off for more money. Still, it's cool to see how the different fire rates for different weapons makes them feel. Finding a rocket launcher that automatically launches its full magazine of three rockets and quickly reloads, for example, is a real thrill, especially considering how sluggish most of the other launchers are. The thrill of never knowing when you're going to find a useful or rare weapon is very substantial, and it's more than enough to keep you coming back to wade through the endless avalanche of common junk.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113121-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_102.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113121\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113121-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_102.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113121\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113121-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_102.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Each character comes with a preset look, but you can define the clothing colors.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The way that Borderlands' guns are varied also applies to the rest of the game's equipment. Though you don't equip actual armor, characters can be outfitted with a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-2\" href=\"/halo/3025-2/\" slug=\"halo\"> Halo</a>-like recharging shield. Each shield comes with a different number of shield points and a different recharge rate. Many of them also have bonus effects, rendering you more resistant to specific types of elemental damage or even recharging your health as well as your shield power. If there's one thing I've learned over the 50+ hours I spent with Borderlands, it's that shields that restore your health are the only worthwhile shields in the entire game. Grenades can also be altered via items that modify their damage and their effect. So you can equip MIRV grenades that split apart when they land, damaging a wider radius. Or you can equip transfusion grenades, which steal health from enemies and give it back to you. Not to tell you how to play the game or anything, but I recommend you stick with transfusion grenades whenever possible.<br/> <br/> The other big deciding factor in how you'll play Borderlands comes from the four character classes you'll choose from at the beginning of the game. Though there aren't any meaningful item restrictions that will prevent you from playing any class however you please, each class has its own skill tree that will build your character in a variety of different ways. You get one skill point per level once you hit level five, and stop getting them when you hit the level cap at level 50. The soldier class has skills that can make him something of a medic, such as cauterize, which lets you heal other players by shooting them. He also has skills that help him further specialize in the use of combat rifles and shotguns, but specializing in specific weapons doesn't seem like a great idea, since you never know what the next amazing gun you're going to find will be. I spent most of my time with a soldier and probably used a sub-machine gun for most of the game.<br/> <br/> The other three classes feel like they want you to specialize your play style in a much more dramatic way than the soldier through a mix of weapon specialization skills and class-specific action skills. The Hunter has a bird that can be called out to attack enemies. Plenty of skill points can be spent making the bird more effective, and plenty more can be spent specializing in sniper rifles, which are only really useful in specific situations because most of the game's enemies are all about closing the gap and getting right up in your face. That doesn't leave a lot of room to snipe.<br/> <br/> The siren has a \"phasewalk\" action skill that lets you avoid damage for a brief period of time. You also explode into and out of the phased state, which damages nearby enemies. Most of the siren's other abilities deal with either causing or preventing elemental damage, which comes in four forms: fire (good for burning flesh), shock (good for depleting shields), corrosive (good for armored targets), and explosive (good for... exploding).<br/> <br/> The berserker class has skills that help him specialize in rocket launchers, which, like sniper rifles, aren't so hot in close quarters situations. His action skill is a berserk state that makes him a two-fisted brawler, which is a lot of fun to use, especially once you've spent some skill points to trick it out.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113104-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_083.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113104\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113104-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_083.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113104\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113104-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_083.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113104-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_083.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Flynt's not happy to see you.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>But what about the world that all of these guns and skills have been crammed into? Well, Borderlands takes place on an alien planet called Pandora. It's overrun with convicts and psychos, but there's also word that it's the resting place of a secret alien vault, rumored to be filled with all sorts of technology. So the player characters are vault hunters, new to the planet, but hoping to get rich quick. At the beginning of the game you start receiving video messages from some kind of guardian angel. She guides you here and there as you play, but you're really guided by the game's on-screen compass, which tells you where to go next to work on your currently selected quest. Though there are some interesting characters and some well-written dialogue in Borderlands, the story is paper-thin. Some will say that it's nice that the story doesn't get in the way of the action, but it's hard not to feel like you've accidentally skipped some cutscenes or something by the end of the game. Once you do complete the story, you're dumped back into the world, letting you finish up any remaining quests you may have.<br/> <br/> Completing the game also unlocks \"playthrough 2,\" a sort of New Game Plus option that lets you take your existing character and start over in a world where the first enemies you encounter are around level 34 or so. It's certainly more difficult the second time around, but if you take the time to do more than just the critical story missions and complete a good chunk of side-quests, you'll be a few levels ahead of the opposition most of the time, giving you a distinct advantage. There is no playthrough 3, and there doesn't seem to be any way to replay quests that you've completed, either. This seems like it'd eventually lead to a situation where your character is unsuitable as a host for a multiplayer game, since the host determines which quests are active.<br/> <br/> The enemies in Borderlands break down into around eight different types, including the wild, dog-like skags, sizable enemy crabs, humanoid bandits, spiderants, flying creatures, and so on. A lot of the enemy AI is very predictable, and just about anything that isn't a human will usually just rush in your direction and start doing as much damage as possible. Human enemies will occasionally take cover, but they still aren't very bright. That also applies to boss battles, as well. The game's two largest, coolest-looking boss fights can be summed up by the following strategy: \"stand still and aim for the thing that looks like a lady's naughty bits.\" On my first playthrough, I beat the final boss without even moving. It's a shame that the enemy AI isn't more wily, but in most cases, they make up for their lack of smarts by outnumbering you by a wide margin. So you might want to bring some friends.<br/> <br/> You can certainly play alone and solo your way through the entire game, but it's a lot more interesting if you engage in cooperative play. Borderlands lets up to four players band together, and the game's difficulty slides up as you add players, making everything a bit more exciting. A lot of the game feels like it was built for co-op play, from the two-man vehicles that let one guy sit on a turret to a dueling system that lets you fight one-on-one against another player to a full-on arena that lets all four players engage in round-based battles against one another. Players can revive their friends, too, which is added on top of a neat \"second wind\" feature that brings a downed player back to life if he can shoot and kill an enemy while he's bleeding out. The game also claims that you'll find more and better loot when you play with others.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113087-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113087\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1113087-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1113087\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113087-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_063.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1113087-t_borderlands_sdcc09_extgamep_hd_063.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Finding and fixing robots out in the wastes gets you more inventory slots.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The downside of the game's online play is that it feels like it's missing a few key features. There's no trade interface at all, so players who want to exchange items are forced to drop them on the ground, a \"system\" that is easily exploited by unscrupulous players. Also, there's nothing stopping any one player from running around and grabbing every item that drops. Lastly, there doesn't seem to be a way to drop money, so there's no way to buy items from other players. The lack of MMO-like looting rules or a proper trade interface means that playing with strangers can get a little risky, as you never know when someone's going to dust off their old, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20252\" href=\"/phantasy-star-online/3030-20252/\" slug=\"phantasy-star-online\"> Phantasy Star Online</a>-era tricks, screw you over, and quit the server. The only thing that mitigates this a bit is that there's so much loot dropping all the time that it's hard to care too much about any one item... chances are, if you keep playing, you'll find something even better within an hour or two. Speaking of hours, I completed a first run of Borderlands in around 18 hours, completing almost every quest I could find. Getting one character up to level 50 took around 35 hours.<br/> <br/> Though there are a few too many spots in the game where the frame rate noticeably drops, Borderlands is a great-looking game. It's the art style that makes it stand out, with a lot of awesome texture work that makes the entire game look like it was drawn by hand. It makes the environments, most of which have the look of a post-apocalyptic wasteland, really catch your eye. Effects, such as the way enemies burn up when they die from a fire attack, are also really great to see... and hear. The game's got some terrific screams to go along with watching a man burn alive. <i>Terrific</i> screams.<br/> <br/> The structure of Borderlands makes it feel like an MMO game that doesn't require you to rely on groups of other players to enjoy. Though it's probably better when you're playing online with friends, playing alone is still perfectly fine. It's also one of those games that's so strong in parts that its shortcomings become almost glaring by comparison. As such, the game's barebones story, lackluster AI, and insufficient player trading options are real disappointments that prevent the game from reaching its full potential. But when you're frantically trying to stay alive while getting swarmed by an angry horde of gigantic spiderants, chances are you won't care much about that other stuff.

Its pedigree is certified with the involvement of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10014\" href=\"/pitfall/3030-10014/\" slug=\"pitfall\">           Pitfall!</a> creator <a data-ref-id=\"3040-29662\" href=\"/david-crane/3040-29662/\" slug=\"david-crane\">          David Crane</a>, and the concept of a protagonist coaxing varied utility out of his gelatinous companion by feeding it jelly beans is as weird as it is whimsical. Lots of clever ideas, but as a game, it was kind of gawky and awkward. In a sterling example of the right way to do a remake, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2294\" href=\"/wayforward-technologies/3010-2294/\" slug=\"wayforward-technologies\">         WayForward</a>'s A Boy and His Blob for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" slug=\"wii\">        Wii</a> takes the underlying premise, amplifies that game's strengths, and shaves away its rougher edges. It's a far more approachable game, but it's also not condescending, making it suitable for players both young and old. It's also a seriously adorable game, with a gentle hand-drawn art style that really emphasizes the sweet, unspoken friendship of the two title characters.<br/><br/>Beyond the brief opening boy-meets-blob sequence, there's not much explicit storytelling in A Boy and His Blob. The dynamic duo travel through the woods, underground caves, and finally, the blob's contoured, pastel-hued home planet of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-459\" href=\"/blobolonia/3035-459/\" slug=\"blobolonia\">       Blobolonia</a>, all the while collecting treasure and magic jelly beans while dodging sinister black blobs of varying shapes and sizes. On their own, either character wouldn't survive for too long in this treacherous world. The boy can't jump very high, can't swim, can't survive long falls, and doesn't have a life bar to buffer against fatal contact with bad blobs or spike pits. Aside from his peculiar companionship, he is just a boy. The blob, on the other hand, is basically invincible, though he's also just a shapeless wad of white stuff. (For whatever reason, I imagine the blob has a consistency somewhere between a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1170\" href=\"/marshmallow/3055-1170/\" slug=\"marshmallow\">      marshmallow</a> and Silly Putty.) But, when the boy feeds the blob a jelly bean, which you can select different flavors of through a simple radial menu, the blob can take on a myriad of forms, allowing the pair to overcome obstacles and subdue enemies.<br/><br/>This is the crux of the gameplay in A Boy and His Blob: figuring out how to use the blob's candy-induced abilities to get the boy from point A to point B. You start off with simple stuff like <a data-ref-id=\"3055-520\" href=\"/ladder/3055-520/\" slug=\"ladder\">    ladders</a>, trampolines, and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-714\" href=\"/looney-tunes/3025-714/\" slug=\"looney-tunes\">     Looney Tunes</a>-style portable holes. New abilities are introduced steadily over the course of the game, though the abilities you'll have on any given level are predetermined, creating limitations that force you to consider the less-than-obvious approach to a certain obstacle. There are fleeting moments in A Boy and His Blob that require a little twitch timing, particularly the game's incongruously unforgiving boss fights, but it's mostly a lot of deliberate puzzle-solving. There are moments that seem to demand some arbitrary trial-and-error, but for the most part the puzzling aspects of A Boy and His Blob rely on simple, straightforward, logical problem-solving.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3017/915392-a_boy_and_his_blob_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915392\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.715\" data-width=\"600\" style=\"width: 600px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:71.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3017/915392-a_boy_and_his_blob_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-915392\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3017/915392-a_boy_and_his_blob_05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0It looks even better in motion.</figcaption></figure>  This review already says more about the gameplay in A Boy and His Blob than the game itself does, a point I particularly appreciate about this game. There's no heavy-handed tutorial, just some regular, helpful signage to clue you in on which jelly bean you might want to consider using. Beyond that, the game lets you figure it out for yourself, without too much penalty, as the levels are heavily checkpointed and you've got infinite jelly beans to toss around. Not that A Boy and His Blob is a terribly complex game, but I feel like one of the worst things a kids' game can do is talk down to the player. <br/><br/>If the simple efficiency of the gameplay doesn't grab you entirely, A Boy and His Blob might maintain your attention with the clean lines and sharp detail of the presentation. Visually, this is a much less adorned game than, say, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24017\" href=\"/muramasa-the-demon-blade/3030-24017/\" slug=\"muramasa-the-demon-blade\">   Muramasa</a>, but there's still ample craft to the smooth animation found throughout A Boy and His Blob. There are touches like the way the boy's shirt edges will flutter as he falls, the odd, tiny bits of blobby wildlife going about their business on Blobolonia, or the seamlessness with which the boy and his blob hug that really help bring the whole thing together. The sound follows the same clean and simple design philosophy, relying on a few pieces of lively mood music and some minimalist voice work for both boy and blob. I particularly appreciated that the voice work for the boy, whose speech is mostly limited to brief instruction, sounds like an actual boy, not a cartoon character. It's a subtle touch that gives the whole game a little bit of weight.<br/><br/>There's an unassuming thoughtfulness to A Boy and His Blob that, in an odd sort of way, has the feel of some of the better children's programming you might see on public television. It's not educational per se, but it values subdued atmosphere and elementary puzzle design over flashy, merchandise-friendly mascots with prepackaged catchphrases. Like public television, some might find it a little too sincere and slow-paced, but even if it doesn't suit your tastes, it's hard to deny the craft at work in A Boy and His Blob.", "deck": "A Boy and His Blob is a charming all-ages affair that one-ups the game it's based on in virtually every conceivable way.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-218/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25508/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/a-boy-and-his-blob/3030-25508/", "id": 25508, "name": "A Boy and His Blob"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-10-23 11:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84164/", "id": 84164, "name": "A Boy and His Blob"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010-review/1900-219/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1146805-wwe_smackdown_vs_raw_2010_profilelarge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146805\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1146805-wwe_smackdown_vs_raw_2010_profilelarge.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146805\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/1146805-wwe_smackdown_vs_raw_2010_profilelarge.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Woo.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Professional wrestling is completely ridiculous... and I mean that in the best possible way. The age-old struggle of good versus evil, as retold by the likes of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-562\" href=\"/chris-jericho/3005-562/\" slug=\"chris-jericho\">Chris Jericho</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-597\" href=\"/shawn-michaels/3005-597/\" slug=\"shawn-michaels\">Shawn Michaels</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-617\" href=\"/tommy-dreamer/3005-617/\" slug=\"tommy-dreamer\">Tommy Dreamer</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-470\" href=\"/john-cena/3005-470/\" slug=\"john-cena\">John Cena</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-469\" href=\"/triple-h/3005-469/\" slug=\"triple-h\">Triple H</a>, and a host of other bulked-up muscledudes is classic and cheesy at its best and an ironic and hilarious train wreck at its worst. The problem with translating it into a video game is that the scripted moments in the physical action allow for a flow that can't be easily duplicated when you're trying to make an AI opponent behave the way they do on television. This year's version of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" slug=\"thq\">THQ</a>'s long-running WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW series still has all of those issues. But it also has a story editor that lets players create new moments using the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-130\" href=\"/wwe/3025-130/\" slug=\"wwe\">WWE</a>'s cast of characters. It's not perfect, but it's a great first attempt at letting WWE fans truly control every aspect of\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3040-39858\" href=\"/vince-mcmahon/3040-39858/\" slug=\"vince-mcmahon\">Vince McMahon</a>'s crazy universe.<br/> <br/> There are over 60 wrestlers in the game, representing all three of the WWE's sub-brands and also including male and female wrestlers. The game's got just about everyone you could ask for, including all of the names mentioned above, as well as other wrestlers like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-614\" href=\"/cm-punk/3005-614/\" slug=\"cm-punk\">CM Punk</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-251\" href=\"/christian-cage/3005-251/\" slug=\"christian-cage\">Christian</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-612\" href=\"/mickie-james/3005-612/\" slug=\"mickie-james\">Mickie James</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-576\" href=\"/matt-hardy/3005-576/\" slug=\"matt-hardy\">Matt Hardy</a>. Also, since the list of people actually employed by the WWE seems to change on a daily basis, there are a number of selectable wrestlers in the game that are no longer with the company, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-571\" href=\"/jeff-hardy/3005-571/\" slug=\"jeff-hardy\">Jeff Hardy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-561\" href=\"/john-bradshaw-layfield/3005-561/\" slug=\"john-bradshaw-layfield\">JBL</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-604\" href=\"/mr-kennedy/3005-604/\" slug=\"mr-kennedy\">Mr. Kennedy</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-599\" href=\"/umaga/3005-599/\" slug=\"umaga\">Umaga</a>. You can also create your own wrestlers using a robust set of tools that allow you to apply preset clothing items and modify them with a paint tool that lets you create your own logos and other detail work. There's enough stuff in there to create reasonable facsimiles of real-life wrestlers who aren't on the game's roster (there are already versions of guys like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3877\" href=\"/razor-ramon/3005-3877/\" slug=\"razor-ramon\">Scott Hall</a>, Magnum TA, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-247\" href=\"/hulk-hogan/3005-247/\" slug=\"hulk-hogan\">Hulk Hogan</a> floating around), characters from other forms of media (I made a pretty lame version of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-266\" href=\"/guile/3005-266/\" slug=\"guile\">Guile</a> in about 10 minutes), or even just your own original characters, if you want to get fully creative.<br/> <br/> In addition to creating logos and wrestlers, you can also create custom entrances, edit together video clips, and piece together finishing moves from preset animations. But the real crux of the game's creative side is the new story editor, which lets you create pretty detailed story lines by adding your own custom text to a set of prefabricated \"moments.\" Most of the standard things you see week-to-week on a wrestling program are represented, like backstage interviews, shots of the commentators, wrestlers standing in the ring, shouting into microphones, and so on. The more dramatic elements of wrestling, like people getting hit by cars (with mystery drivers!) or wrestlers jumping out of the crowd to attack are also represented. Though I can certainly envision a few oft-used scenarios that aren't included (such as driving a beer truck directly into the arena, having a wrestler break through a wall and immediately fall down, or anything involving a coffin), the whole setup feels pretty flexible. You simply choose the location and animation, which characters are in the scene, and write dialogue, if necessary. You can also add matches with different goals to your stories, giving players something to fight for in-between story segments. Like the other created aspects of the game, you can share your completed stories online.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1145322-wwe_smackdown_vs_raw_2010_ss_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1145322\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.63636363636364\" data-width=\"440\" style=\"width: 440px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:63.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1145322-wwe_smackdown_vs_raw_2010_ss_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1145322\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/1145322-wwe_smackdown_vs_raw_2010_ss_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The story creator. Anything you do here will automatically be better than that Katie Vick thing.</figcaption></figure>In addition to just making things yourself, the game also contains a bunch of preset modes. The Road to Wrestlemania mode returns this year, offering preset stories for <a data-ref-id=\"3005-566\" href=\"/edge/3005-566/\" slug=\"edge\">Edge</a>, Mickie James, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-602\" href=\"/randy-orton/3005-602/\" slug=\"randy-orton\">Randy Orton</a>, Shawn Michaels, created superstars, and one called \"Brand Warfare\" that includes multiple wrestlers and can be played cooperatively. These start you out around 90 days before Wrestlemania, and take you through the lead-up to the biggest show the WWE puts on. Winning matches moves you through the story. Most of the stories are pretty decent and feel like they could plausibly occur on WWE's television programming. Beyond creating your own stuff, this is probably the best stuff in the entire game, even if a lot of the voice acting is kind of terrible. It all sounds like it was recorded in a voiceover booth and lacks all of the intensity that wrestlers and announcers typically convey when in front of a live crowd. There's also a career mode that lets you move up through a set of rankings to eventually challenge for belts, and you can, of course, configure a match using the full roster and a wide collection of match types to just play.<br/> <br/> But the part of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26888\" href=\"/wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010/3030-26888/\" slug=\"wwe-smackdown-vs-raw-2010\">WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2010</a> where you pick up the controller and start wrestling is where the whole thing falls apart. The game's canned animations string together in awkward-looking ways that are sometimes hard to predict, and the action feels repetitive and unrefined. The game has one counter button that can be used to counter just about anything, if you can fit your button presses into a pretty tight timing window. And a lot of it is clunky, especially when more than two wrestlers are involved, as the game holds your focus on one opponent, even if you start running at another. So if you've knocked one guy down and turn your attention to another, standing opponent, most of the time you'll do elbow drops and other moves intended for a guy that's on the mat. The weird part is that they still hit the standing wrestler. You can fiddle with the game's settings to allow for manual focus controls, but forcing you to dictate your intentions like that doesn't feel much better.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1180600-screen_shot_2009_10_27_at_1.16.44_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1180600\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56490134994808\" data-width=\"963\" style=\"width: 963px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1180600-screen_shot_2009_10_27_at_1.16.44_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1180600\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1180600-screen_shot_2009_10_27_at_1.16.44_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1180600-screen_shot_2009_10_27_at_1.16.44_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption> \u00a0 Most of the female models look fairly bad.\u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Also, the action in the game feels very little like actual WWE in-ring wrestling. There are things you have to worry about that only come up on television when it's convenient, like rope breaks, where a pin gets broken up because the guy on the bottom has his foot under the ropes. In the game, you feel like you're constantly having to worry about the position of every wrestler, because it's far too easy to pull off your finisher in the wrong spot and not be able to follow it up with a pin. Tag matches also feel fundamentally different when they're treated like an actual sport, rather than scripted entertainment. Overall, the action is disappointing and the AI is pretty lackluster. So you're better off with human opposition... provided they're sitting right next to you. Yes, the game has online play, but the only time I was able to find a match that wasn't laggy to the point of pointlessness is when I took two copies of the game and ran them both on the same Internet connection. Considering how much of the gameplay is focused on properly timed button presses, this makes the game barely playable online. At least you can upload and download created items with other players.<br/> <br/> WWE SmackDown! vs. RAW 2010 doesn't fix any of the fundamental issues that the series has had for years, and as this style of gameplay gets another year older, it looks that much more dated. The good news is that all of the stuff surrounding the actual gameplay is getting to be really good. I'd be perfectly fine with never wrestling another match... but I'll probably go back and create a couple of completely ridiculous stories using a bunch of created wrestlers.

There's also a fair amount of platforming. These ingredients have been staples of the Ratchet series since its inception, but like a seasoned chef, Insomniac has added just the right amount of each to concoct a treat that will keep you satisfied until your last bolt-ridden bite. <br/><br/>Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time is the series' third installment on the PlayStation 3 and picks up where the previous two games left off. Our little robot friend <a data-ref-id=\"3005-323\" href=\"/clank/3005-323/\" slug=\"clank\">            Clank</a> has been abducted and hidden away by some adorable, mysterious beings known as the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2642\" href=\"/zoni/3015-2642/\" slug=\"zoni\">           Zoni</a>.

Ratchet handles most of the heavy action and fighting as he travels the galaxy, while Clank focuses more on solving puzzles inside the Great Clock. The game will transition from one character to the other after key missions have been completed, and it all flows smoothly. <br/><br/>Though Ratchet is occasionally joined by Qwark, or another fighter, he will mostly be fighting hordes of enemies aided solely by his weapons... his many, many, ridiculous weapons. The Ratchet and Clank games have always included a sizable arsenal, but A Crack in Time has some of the most unique, useful, and satisfying ways to kill or incapacitate your foes yet. You'll see the return of some favorites, like the always entertaining, boogie-inducing Groovitron Glove, but you'll also be treated to such <i>tools of destruction</i> as the Rift Inducer 5000. This little number happens to be a device that tears open a dimensional portal allowing a tentacled beast to peek through and devour your enemies for a limited time. Honestly, I only found a few duds in the mix (I'm looking at you Dynamo of Doom) and by constantly giving you the chance to upgrade your weapons through continued use, the game encourages you to experiment with new ones. Upgrading is a huge part of the game and each weapon can reach a maximum level of five, at which point it will transform into a slightly modified, and better version of its former self. For example, continually using Mr. Zurkon--a minuscule floating robotic helper bent on destruction--will eventually transform him into Zurkon the Destroyer. Each time you reach a new level with a weapon, stats like damage or rate of fire will increase, and the leveling comes so quickly that you constantly feel like you're progressing towards some goal as you mow down the endless hordes of baddies.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1131245-3907298213_8e54b53a29_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1131245\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1131245-3907298213_8e54b53a29_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1131245\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1131245-3907298213_8e54b53a29_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The action is as plentiful as the upgrades. </figcaption></figure> Upgrades for your arsenal will also come in the form of new components for your Constructo weapons. These include the Constructo Pistol,   Shotgun, and Bomb. Each can be fitted with parts that you'll collect throughout the adventure, allowing you to toggle between attributes like the rapid fire or charge triggers on the pistol. These modifications drastically affect the properties of each weapon and you'll be mixing and matching them to your liking. With all the options available on the Constructo weapons, I found them to be my go-to choice when I wasn't giggling at robots dancing or summoning inter-dimensional beings to do my bidding.<br/><br/>     Did I mention upgrades? Ratchet will also be upgrading his ship with new lasers, missiles, and armor as he flies around the galaxy searching for his little robotic buddy. When you're not running around planet-side, wreaking havoc, you can now pilot your ship freely through defined sectors of space engaging in combat or landing on the many smaller planets to find more collectibles. All of the space travel and combat is locked to a horizontal plane, so instead of being able to pitch your ship up or down, your evasive maneuvering is limited to barrel rolls and 180 degree turns. Most of the non-terrestrial combat isn't terribly engaging, but the ability to take optional missions and land your ship on the planetoids to hunt down collectibles is a welcome inclusion. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1044844-ratchet_clank_a_crack_in_time_playstation_3_ps3_009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044844\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1044844-ratchet_clank_a_crack_in_time_playstation_3_ps3_009.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044844\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1044844-ratchet_clank_a_crack_in_time_playstation_3_ps3_009.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1044844-ratchet_clank_a_crack_in_time_playstation_3_ps3_009.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Don't be fooled, this is all highly organized.</figcaption></figure> While Ratchet is tearing about the universe, Clank will be engaging in his own subtler methods of world saving. He'll be using his newly acquired time-shifting abilities to navigate and solve puzzles within the Great Clock. The most devious of these time-and-mind-bending obstacles are the ones that require you to record multiple versions of yourself as you race to trigger different events around the room. A simple example would begin with recording your movements with Clank A. You position Clank A to stand on a pressure plate that, when depressed, allows access to another button in the distance. You would then end that recording and start a new one with Clank B, during which you can watch as Clank A goes about his prerecorded business of clearing the way for you to access that distant button. The complexity quickly ramps up and you'll eventually have up to four versions of yourself all running around performing tasks that somehow aid the other recordings. If that sounds complicated, it is, but it's also extremely rewarding and once you've completed a puzzle you will not only be showered with bolts, the currency of this universe, but you'll also feel like the smartest human on the planet. If you truly are not feeling up to the task, you can opt to bypass the puzzle entirely, but will miss out on the monetary rewards as well as the boost to your ego. <br/> <br/>     All of this puzzle solving and item collection takes place in one of the more visually stunning games to date. The environments are brightly colored, interestingly designed, and well realized. The animators over at Insomniac must be some of the best in the business because all the characters move with a fluidity and appropriately cartoonish exaggeration rarely seen in video games. The level of quality and care taken is present in everything from the rendered cutscenes to the Groovitron dances. Complimenting the visuals is the sound design which is also top notch. From the voice acting to the music, the audio breathes life into an already living world and serves to draw you into the rich experience.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>While the humor in the game falls more on the corny side, I definitely found myself chuckling at some of the gags, and it all seems to gel with the rest of the presentation. The story may not be the most enthralling but it's told well and it will help to keep you curious as you progress through the game. Playing through on normal, and collecting a majority of items, I was able to complete my first playthrough at around eleven hours. After you're finished you'll have the option to go back and find all the goodies you missed along the way or restart in the Challenge Mode with all your existing weapons and upgrades.<br/><br/>With A Crack in Time apparently marking the end of the \"Future\" storyline on the PlayStation 3, I really couldn't ask for a better embodiment of everything I've come to enjoy from the series. The constant satisfaction from upgrading creative weaponry, item collection which feels rewarding rather than trivial, and the over-the-top action are all here, and better than they've ever been. With the addition of some interesting puzzles, even more flexibility with your weapons, and a great presentation, Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time is not only the best game in the series, but one that will certainly stand the test of, well, time.", "deck": "Ratchet and Clank Future: A Crack in Time manages to play to its strengths while adding enough to make this the best in the series.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-220/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25673/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/ratchet-clank-future-a-crack-in-time/3030-25673/", "id": 25673, "name": "Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-10-23 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84339/", "id": 84339, "name": "Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time"}, "reviewer": "Vinny"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dj-hero-review/1900-221/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1137668-3730_djherodaftpunkvenue_1252942321.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1137668\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.563\" data-width=\"1000\" style=\"width: 1000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1137668-3730_djherodaftpunkvenue_1252942321.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1137668\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1099/1137668-3730_djherodaftpunkvenue_1252942321.jpg\"></a><figcaption>It'll take some time before all of this feels like second nature.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>It's been awhile since we've seen an honest-to-goodness turntable video game here in the US. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-87\" href=\"/konami-corporation/3010-87/\" slug=\"konami-corporation\">Konami</a> experimented a bit with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2951\" href=\"/beatmania/3030-2951/\" slug=\"beatmania\">Beatmania</a>, but it's been a pretty dry decade. That's part of what makes <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">Activision</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23882\" href=\"/dj-hero/3030-23882/\" slug=\"dj-hero\">DJ Hero</a> so exciting. It's a new peripheral with a new take on how rhythm games are played. It's also exciting because it represents genres of music that aren't getting much attention from the power duo of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">Rock Band</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-289\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\" slug=\"guitar-hero\">Guitar Hero</a>, like various types of electronic dance music and hip-hop. With a cool setlist that's implemented in a unique way and a peripheral that backs up the on-screen happenings pretty well, DJ Hero is a solid start to what will probably make for a fruitful franchise.<br/> <br/> Sorry to open up by looking ahead to sequels that haven't been announced yet, but the big thing you'll probably notice about DJ Hero is that it feels like a first-generation product. Remember how the original Guitar Hero didn't let you do much more than just play the songs and look at your score? That's most of what DJ Hero has to offer. You're presented with different mixes, each with anywhere from two to eight songs in it, and you'll play the tracks, one after the next, until you've completed that tier of songs. You'll earn stars for your performance, which opens up more set lists and additional window dressing, like playable characters, new stages, more outfits, and so on. Some of the characters are real-life DJs, like Z-Trip, Grandmaster Flash, and Daft Punk.<br/> <br/> That sounds straightforward, but there's a bit more to it. You can play against another player either locally or over the Internet. These are simple score competitions that allow the host to build a custom playlist, if desired. You can also play ten of the game's tracks with a local player wielding a Guitar Hero guitar controller. This seems like it was added as a bit of an afterthought. Sure, these custom mixes aren't found in a non-guitar format, but the guitar parts can be repetitive in some cases, and get lost in the cacophony of DJ whistles and scratching in others.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2490/1093878-djherorenegade2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093878\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56326530612245\" data-width=\"490\" style=\"width: 490px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2490/1093878-djherorenegade2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1093878\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2490/1093878-djherorenegade2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The turntable itself is a well-made piece of wireless machinery.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The game is played with a custom-built turntable controller that has a crossfader, an effects dial, a button to activate Euphoria (which is the game's equivalent of Guitar Hero's star power), and a turntable with three buttons on it. Your primary activity is pressing these buttons and holding them while you scratch the record back and forth in time with the on-screen indicators. The game will also tell you when you flip the crossfader back and forth, which cuts between the two records. For the most part, the controller is fine, but scratching while holding down the buttons feels a bit weird. It's like the turntable's platter is a bit too heavy, so it gets moving with a bit of momentum when you're scratching. This leads to imprecision, which is never great in games like these. Also, you'll probably need to spend some serious time with the controller to get used to hitting it without looking down at it. Also, the crossfader can be a little tricky. It's easy to slide it too far when you're trying to center it.<br/> <br/> So as you might have guessed, this game isn't as easy to pick up and play as Guitar Hero was back in its day, since the activity of DJ'ing is a bit more abstract, but the game opens with a great tutorial that helps make everything clear. That said, you'll need some practice to actually get good at the game. It didn't take much time for me to start getting five stars on every song I encountered on medium, but the two harder difficulties make meaningful changes to the way the game is played, making it both more difficult and more rewarding. While playing on medium, I felt like I was growing into the harder difficulties as I played.<br/> <br/> There aren't too many surprises in the way DJ Hero plays out, as you're essentially just playing along to the music. If you match the on-screen cues, you earn stars and the music plays properly. When you miss, things go poorly, but you'll never fail out. The game will let you trudge on with your performance, even when you're playing like crap. There are a few wild cards that let you have a direct impact on the sound of a song, like the effects knob, which you can use to filter the tunes in certain spots. Occasionally you'll get big lines down the middle channel. This is your cue to go nuts with the center button to freestyle some extra effects over the music. You can select from multiple packs of freestyle sounds while you're selecting your character, giving you access to banks of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2277\" href=\"/flavor-flav/3005-2277/\" slug=\"flavor-flav\">Flavor Flav</a> samples, spacey dub siren sounds, and a rough equivalent to that dancehall air horn noise that all DJs use. All of them. Clearly, the air horn is the only correct choice, but ultimately, your off-beat slamming of the center button only serves to make the songs sound worse. The rewind feature, which lets you back up a portion of the song and play it again with a double-score multiplier, is also neat in theory, but it almost never sounds good. It uses a generic rewind noise and never sounds natural--you always feel like you're knocking the song off-beat. Still, using things like the rewind and euphoria power is the key to earning high scores and getting stars.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1043330-mq96hurxokd8letr212_erocribblecratching.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043330\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5150/1043330-mq96hurxokd8letr212_erocribblecratching.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043330\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1043330-mq96hurxokd8letr212_erocribblecratching.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5150/1043330-mq96hurxokd8letr212_erocribblecratching.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0If this looks too crazy, relax. The lower difficulty settings get incredibly easy.</figcaption></figure>There's a really sharp soundtrack in DJ Hero that covers a lot of different genres. With the guitar controller playing into some songs, you'll find songs from the Foo Fighters and The Killers in there, as well as a version of Motorhead's \"Ace of Spades.\" But you aren't playing these songs on their own. Each track is built from two or more different songs, and they're mashed together to form something new and kind of crazy. Sometimes it works out perfectly, like when Daft Punk and Queen are dropped into one track. Other times, it feels a little hokey, like when DJ Z-Trip and Murs rework Foreigner's \"Jukebox Hero\" into a song about turntables called, you know, \"DJ Hero.\" By and large, the mixes are well-produced and many of them could stand on their own outside of the game.<br/> <br/> Visually, DJ Hero does the same thing that all games like this do. You'll be too busy focusing on the highway to see what buttons you need to hit next to notice the variety of backgrounds and characters. One thing you'll definitely notice, though, are the constantly flashing lights in some areas. At times, I felt like the game should stop and throw up one of those epilepsy warnings. Last night I seriously thought about sliding a wallet under my tongue, you know, just in case. The stages and strobes and huge party scenes actually look really cool, if you have time to pay attention to them. Also, watching virtual Daft Punk, dressed up like robots, slamming pads and buttons on their polygonal gear is pretty cool. Unfortunately, there are a lot of times where the on-screen DJ isn't matching your actions. Watching Jazzy Jeff throw his hands in the air while you're furiously scratching just looks like a really goofy oversight.<br/> <br/> It's a bit barebones, and the turntable controller feels like it could have been better in a couple of spots. But as the start of something new, DJ Hero provides a very strong foundation that things like additional downloadable content or full-fledged sequels could really build on. If you've been fiending for a rhythm game that represents a different style of music or you just like cutting and scratching, DJ Hero's a lot of fun.", "deck": "DJ Hero's gameplay is challenging and exciting with a feel all its own, making it a welcome addition to the world of peripheral-based rhythm games.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-221/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23882/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dj-hero/3030-23882/", "id": 23882, "name": "DJ Hero"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-10-27 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84243/", "id": 84243, "name": "DJ Hero"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mario-luigi-bowsers-inside-story-review/1900-222/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171257-270x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171257\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171257-270x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171257\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1171257-270x.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Operating inside Bowser isn't as gross as it sounds.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-23983\" href=\"/mario-luigi-bowsers-inside-story/3030-23983/\" slug=\"mario-luigi-bowsers-inside-story\">Mario &amp; Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story</a> actually made me feel excited to play a traditional Japanese-style RPG. That's no mean feat; it's something I thought I might never feel again.

As before, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">Luigi</a> attack with hammers and (surprise) by jumping on enemies, and if you hit the right buttons at the right times, you can add more power to your attacks. What's more, every enemy in the game gives you subtle, clever hints about how it's about to attack you, so if you closely examine these clues you can dodge the attacks and avoid taking damage entirely. With the right combination of attention and reflexes, it's possible to make it through random encounters quickly and emerge completely unscathed. That's a satisfying feeling, every time, and even three games into the series, it's is still a great way to keep the flow of the game moving and make it more fun to play through random battles than simply issuing menu commands and trading abstract damage values with enemies. Exploration of the overworld is similarly enhanced with some rudimentary platforming and block-bopping, as in the previous games. It's just a fun game to play.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171304-tn_565_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171304\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.74867256637168\" data-width=\"565\" style=\"width: 565px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:74.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1171304-tn_565_24.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1171304\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/1/17172/1171304-tn_565_24.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0There are some completely ridiculous, hilarious characters in here.</figcaption></figure>Nonetheless, in general terms this is exactly the same formula the two previous Mario &amp; Luigi games used, but it's a good one that really\u00a0keeps you on your toes and\u00a0staves off the boredom that can plague other RPGs' combat. And the game puts its own twist on the formula with a strange premise straight out of <i>Inner Space</i>. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9306\" href=\"/mario-luigi-superstar-saga/3030-9306/\" slug=\"mario-luigi-superstar-saga\">Superstar Saga</a>'s hilarious verbal contortionist <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2475\" href=\"/fawful/3005-2475/\" slug=\"fawful\">Fawful</a> finally steps into the villainous spotlight here with a magical plot to make <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">Bowser</a> inhale everyone in the Mushroom Kingdom, including the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">Princess</a>, a bunch of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3369\" href=\"/toads/3015-3369/\" slug=\"toads\">Toads</a>, and of course Mario and Luigi themselves. The bizarre result is that you play half the game as tiny little Mario brothers--exploring locations inside Bowser's body like the Nose Deck, Pump Works, Flame Pipe, and Rump Command--and the other half stomping around the real world as Bowser himself. Ol' King Koopa has his own set of special attacks and defensive moves that make him a bit different to play than the Marios, and while I initially felt like the game leaned a little too heavily toward Bowser gameplay, things eventually shift in such a way that you feel like you're getting to spend plenty of quality time with both sides.<br/> <br/> It helps that Bowser totally steals the show. Inside Story is an absolute riot, full of endearing characters and a droll sense of humor that comes primarily from the ridiculous things coming out of those characters' mouths. If you remember Fawful's nonstop ludicrous turns of phrase in the first game, you can expect that kind of hilarity on a frequent basis from nearly every character you run into in this sequel, with special mention for a heavily French-accented item vendor who also happens to be a coin block. Getting to play as Bowser gives you an amusing glimpse into the Koopa King's megalomania. His ego hilariously fills the room as he reveres the magnitude of his own evilness in one breath and then bosses around a battalion of goombas with the next. I almost can't believe this game made me stop and ponder the plight of Bowser as a displaced evil tyrant--there's a certain forlornness to the way he stomps around the halls of his own castle, trying to convince all his old minions that he is in fact a cooler bad guy than Fawful. That I did stop and think about it might say all that needs to be said about the quality of the game's writing. It's worth playing for the humor alone.<br/> \u00a0<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044227-ntr_marioluigi3_02ss04_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044227\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2788/1044227-ntr_marioluigi3_02ss04_e3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044227\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2788/1044227-ntr_marioluigi3_02ss04_e3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/2788/1044227-ntr_marioluigi3_02ss04_e3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Pictured: Bowser's ego.</figcaption></figure>Though the basic format hasn't changed from the first two games in the series, there are enough little additions and distractions to keep this sequel fresh. The designers manage to mix in all sorts of smart little minigames here and there to break up the role-playing; you'll do some\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3030-5099\" href=\"/space-invaders/3030-5099/\" slug=\"space-invaders\">Space Invaders</a>-style shooting to amp up Bowser's adrenaline, and play what amounts to a basic rhythm game at various times when he needs an extra boost of energy to a specific body part. There are also some collectibles, like badges you can equip on Mario and Luigi that fill up a meter as you fight which grants you free heals and the like.

Actions and spells are assigned to each individual party member by pausing the game mid-battle and issuing orders. Although the game comes with a fairly robust tactical AI editor that lets you set some basic if/else scenarios, you'll probably spend a good portion of time in pause mode, manually issuing commands to your entire group, especially if you're working with more than one mage or if you're the type to obsess over the survival of each party member.<br/>\u00a0<br/>When it comes to comparing Origins with BioWare's PC RPG past, the biggest change is that Dragon Age takes place in its own universe, rather than working within the familiar confines of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-167\" href=\"/dungeons-dragons/3025-167/\" slug=\"dungeons-dragons\">Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a> license. Instead of the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-29\" href=\"/the-forgotten-realms/3035-29/\" slug=\"the-forgotten-realms\">Forgotten Realms</a>, DA:O is set in the world of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2470\" href=\"/ferelden/3035-2470/\" slug=\"ferelden\">Ferelden</a>.\u00a0While the names have changed, Ferelden is as traditional a fantasy setting as you can get.\u00a0It's a world populated by elves, dwarves, and humans who all have varying opinions on the merits of good and evil. While there are subtle shifts in roles here (elves, or \"knife ears,\" for example, are a recently liberated slave race), the trappings of Dragon Age's lore still feel familiar and rooted in the standard fantasy archetypes. But just because it's familiar in spots doesn't mean that it's poorly executed.\u00a0There are a lot of subtle touches--like the way humans from the neighboring state of the Orlesian Empire speak with a French-tinged accent--that help make the world work.<br/><br/> The basics of the plot are that you're a newly minted Grey Warden, the newest recruit of an ancient warrior caste entrusted with keeping the impending Darkspawn threat at bay. Depending upon your character creation choices, you'll start with one of six origin stories that define the first hour of your game. In my playthrough as a mage this meant I was an apprentice within The Circle, an order of mages who are watched over by a company of Templars. My origin not only impacted how others would react to me, but it also gave me new\u00a0dialogue choices and introduced characters I would see again later in my journey. After starting a new character--the son of a dwarven lord--it was surprising to see that this character's origin fit into stories that the mage character heard about while visiting the dwarven lands. The way the different aspects of the origins are referenced help make the world feel like a more cohesive place. Getting more specific\u00a0would likely spoil your fun so just know that your origin, along with the different dialogue choices you'll make throughout the game, make separate playthroughs feel decidedly unique.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1129856-920668_20090909_screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1129856\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/976/1129856-920668_20090909_screen007.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1129856\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/976/1129856-920668_20090909_screen007.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dragon Age features superb voice-acting, with Morrigan stealing the show.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Dragon Age excels because its story is driven more by the needs of your party than by the overarching plot-lines they witness. For example, it's possible for your primary character to become completely overshadowed by the deeds of a fellow party member. Personally, I attempted to stick to a very altruistic path throughout the game, but it's not as easy as simply picking the obviously \"good\" dialogue choices. You'll be presented with tough scenarios where none of the options at hand seem particularly good, leaving you to choose what may seem like merely the least evil choice. In the weeks after completing the game, I still feel sincere regret about how some of those decisions played out and am already making plans to handle them differently in my next playthrough. The choices cut deep.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>The combat in Dragon Age is where the game feels closest to its computer RPG roots.\u00a0This is a classic \"pause-and-command\" type of game, and it comes with all of the difficulty and micromanagement that, if you're familiar with old games in this genre, you'd expect to see. The changes from the old D&amp;D system that the developer has employed are mostly in its easy-upgrade spell tree, along with a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19783\" href=\"/world-of-warcraft/3030-19783/\" slug=\"world-of-warcraft\">World of Warcraft</a>-like cooldown system on many abilities. While combat may have been simplified a bit, it's offset with significantly longer fights. The game's boss fights, in particular, get extremely tough and require proper mana management, some well-timed potion-chugging, and a keen eye to watch out for scripted events. The long dungeon crawls feel like you're controlling every character in a five-man World of Warcraft instance. It's not so much about out-battling your opposition, but outlasting them.<br/>\u00a0<br/>To help give you a bit of an edge in battle, Dragon Age lets you combine some spells and abilities with devastating effects. Frozen enemies can be shattered by the brunt force of hammers or shields, and it's easier to give a foe nightmares if you've already put him to sleep. You'll need as much of an edge as you can get, too, because the combat gets tougher to keep up with as you progress into the back half of the story. Though players looking for less of a challenge can mitigate things a bit by turning the quest down to an easier difficulty, know that if you don't like the idea of having to pause the action to issue orders, you're probably not going to enjoy Dragon Age: Origins. Even with all of the work that's been done to improve on BioWare's Infinity-style formula, this is still a difficult game that requires patience and strategy.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>In addition to getting tough, it's also important to note that Dragon Age is not a short game. My first character (Mordecai the mage) completed his journey in just over 50 hours of game time, though if you were to be very particular about completing more side quests, that number could go way, way higher.<br/>\u00a0<br/>In general, the main quest is well-written, and it's backed up by excellent voicework. That said, if you stay up on your fantasy fiction, you'll probably notice some story elements that beat not-so-subtle similarities to the classic Arthurian saga or even portions of recent pulp epics, like George Martin's\u00a0<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/s/ref=nb_ss?url=search-alias%3Daps&amp;field-keywords=song+of+fire+and+ice&amp;x=0&amp;y=0\" rel=\"nofollow\">A Song of Ice and Fire</a>\u00a0novels. After your origin prologue and initiation into the Grey Wardens, you're essentially given free reign to complete the main plot in whichever order you deem prudent. While mixing this sequence can change the story slightly, it's mostly a linear affair on your way to the game's final two chapters. Shifts in the narrative are more drastic within the chapters themselves, and the choices you'll make regarding certain party members make the game immensely replayable. There are multiple endings to see here, and they feel more fleshed-out and satisfying than the hastily stiched-together conclusions of something like, say, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\" href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" slug=\"fallout-3\">Fallout 3</a>.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1184253-dragon_x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1184253\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/22/1184253-dragon_x.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1184253\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/1184253-dragon_x.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/22/1184253-dragon_x.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The radial menu used in the console version will feel familiar to fans of Mass Effect.</figcaption></figure>The main difference between the PC version of Dragon Age and its console counterparts are in the interface. The PC version sports a classic hotbar configuration and a more tactical perspective on the action, while the console versions\u00a0opt for a <a data-ref-id=\"3025-560\" href=\"/mass-effect/3025-560/\" slug=\"mass-effect\">Mass Effect</a>-style radial menu and over-the-shoulder camera. The console versions certainly aren't bad, but if you're looking to pick the best version, the PC's layout is more elegant and functional than the comparatively limited radial menus on the console release. Also, the PC version is capable of looking significantly better than the console versions, though all editions feature\u00a0impressive spell effects and environments. Though the PC version offers a more pulled-out view, I found myself zoomed in more often than not. In fact, the inclusion of things like skies and ceilings (which weren't exactly present in most previous games of this sort) make the environments complicated enough that the zoomed-out, isometric perspective gets a little clunky.\u00a0<br/><br/> In the end, Dragon Age: Origins feels like a real throwback to the good old days of PC role-playing epics. It also feels like exactly what you expect the makers of Baldur's Gate to come up with as a follow-up to that classic. While that means you could rightfully fault the game for not being especially innovative, it's this adherence to a classic style of gameplay that will ensure that it's welcomed by the legions of nostalgic RPG players that make up this genre's core audience. That said, this is definitely not the game for those frightened of the idea of micromanaging a game to the point where a large portion of it will be spent in a pause screen. However, as the sort of guy that has lovingly played an <a data-ref-id=\"3015-495\" href=\"/infinity-engine/3015-495/\" slug=\"infinity-engine\">Infinity Engine</a> game at least once every year for the past decade, I can think of no higher praise for this throwback than to say that Dragon Age: Origins leaves me feeling fairly confident I won't need to dig out the classics for this ritual next year.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><i>Disclosure: The game featured in this review is or was an advertised product on giantbomb.com. </i><i>\u00a0 \u00a0</i>", "deck": "Even the most nostalgic Infinity Engine stalwarts will find a lot to love in this story-heavy RPG.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-223/", "platforms": "PC, Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20738/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dragon-age-origins/3030-20738/", "id": 20738, "name": "Dragon Age: Origins"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2009-11-03 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-73985/", "id": 73985, "name": "Dragon Age: Origins"}, "reviewer": "Dave"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/torchlight-review/1900-224/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1184823-torchlight_2009_10_28_13_34_45_82.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1184823\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1184823-torchlight_2009_10_28_13_34_45_82.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1184823\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1184823-torchlight_2009_10_28_13_34_45_82.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Diablo players will feel right at home.</figcaption></figure>Torchlight is made for a very specific niche audience that you could simply describe as \"people who still love <a data-ref-id=\"3030-5985\" href=\"/diablo/3030-5985/\" slug=\"diablo\">Diablo</a>.\" It's a classic overhead point-and-click-click-click action RPG with a focus on color-coded loot, endless dungeons, and a menagerie of foul subterannean creatures. If you can parse the relative merits of items with names written in green, blue, purple, and orange--and you still have a burning desire to collect as many such items as you can--Torchlight is designed especially for you.<br/> <br/> The game subscribes so closely to the format of the original Diablo, in fact, that there's only one town in the game--also called <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2539\" href=\"/torchlight/3035-2539/\" slug=\"torchlight\">Torchlight</a>--and it sits atop a single, very long dungeon. You know, just like in Diablo. But there's a lot of variety in that dungeon's dozens of floors, which change visually every few levels from simple catacombs to more elaborate motifs like ancient tombs, a sunken jungle temple, a disused goblin prison surrounded by lava, and more. You get completely different-looking and different-acting enemies that are appropriate to each locale, too, along with some pretty large, gnarly bosses. You can forgive new developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6423\" href=\"/runic-games/3010-6423/\" slug=\"runic-games\">Runic</a> for sticking so closely to the classics, since the company is led by some of the original creators of Diablo. That game's <a data-ref-id=\"3040-3487\" href=\"/matt-uelmen/3040-3487/\" slug=\"matt-uelmen\">composer</a> also returns for this one, lending a fantastic, moody soundtrack that's more than a little reminiscent of his intensely memorable earlier work. (<a data-ref-id=\"3035-499\" href=\"/tristram/3035-499/\" slug=\"tristram\">Town</a> music, anybody?)<br/> <br/> Torchlight is a $20 game, and in some ways, it shows. There's only a paper-thin semblance of a storyline, about a corrupting magical ore and an ancient malevolence hidden beneath the town, and that story is only advanced through occasional brief narrated journal entries, which aren't acted particularly well. There are only a handful of side quests you can undertake from the people of Torchlight, and they simply repeat over and over after you complete them the first time. The writing is a little rough; comma splices and improper apostrophes in the possessive \"its\" constitute glaring errors when you're conveying your fiction entirely through text. The graphics aren't technically complex (though the game more than makes up for that with an exaggerated, cartoony art style and even has a \"netbook\" mode to let it run on really old hardware). I could find a few other, minor things to nitpick.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1184828-torchlight_2009_10_28_14_04_45_86.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1184828\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/13692/1184828-torchlight_2009_10_28_14_04_45_86.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1184828\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/13692/1184828-torchlight_2009_10_28_14_04_45_86.jpg\"></a><figcaption>LOOT! LOOOOOOOOOOT!\u00a0</figcaption></figure>But why should I? These flaws only affect the presentation of the game and aren't ones that detract at all from the quality of the central gameplay experience, which is all about slashing, shooting, an spellcasting your way to deeper dungeons and greater loot. If you're interested in the game in the first place, that's what you came for, and in that one respect, Torchlight is incredibly successful. Runic has streamlined the Diablo-style format to its core essence. There are only three classes--a tough melee fighter, a lither female ranged attacker, and a magic-using alchemist--and since this is a single-player-only game, all of them are versatile enough to make it through the game and conform to your play style. All the sorts of housekeeping activities you'd need to do in a game like this--enchanting weapons, managing inventory, assigning skill points, combining magical gems--are all only a couple of hotkeys away. The interface is really pleasant to deal with.<br/><br/> The best thing about the gameplay is the inclusion of a mandatory pet--a cat or dog that you can name--for every class. Generally, I'm not a big fan of pets, minions, or familiars in games like this--I like all my damage to flow from a single source, namely me--but the pet in Torchlight serves so many useful functions you can't help but love it. You can equip minor gear like rings and necklaces onto your pet to give it stat bonuses. Better, you can teach the pet the same sorts of spells your own character can learn, so if you want it to heal you in battle or silence enemy magic users, you can have it do those things automatically. Personally, I enjoyed teaching my dog to summon skeletal archers and knights into battle, ensuring that every time I hit a big group of enemies, I had a small army of undead backup. The pet has an inventory the same size as yours, and you can even send it back to town to automatically sell whatever items it's carrying, so you don't even have to use a town portal to clear out your vendor trash (though that is of course still an option as well).<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1172617-torchlight1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1172617\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1172617-torchlight1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1172617\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1172617-torchlight1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1172617-torchlight1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0One dungeon but lots of variety.</figcaption></figure>I do wish Torchlight had some sort of cooperative feature, even for just two players, if only because that's become a nearly requisite feature in this style of game over the years. It would also make it more fun to tackle the game's hardest difficulty, especially if you were using the optional \"hardcore\" mode that makes a character's death permanent. Be warned that the game's \"normal\" difficulty mode is pretty darn easy if you've ever played this style of game before--I got several hours into a character on normal before I got tired of merely left-clicking enemies endlessly to kill them without even needing to utilize my secondary skills. Hard or very hard modes are much more taxing and, consequently, more satisfying. You can even share loot between characters, so the awesome gear you find for other classes at higher levels won't go to waste on subsequent playthroughs. And the developer promises a full suite of mod tools soon, to allow amateur content creators the chance to keep pumping the game full of custom dungeons and quests long after you've completed the included campaign and also tired of the infinite dungeon that unlocks once you finish it.<br/><br/> Again, Torchlight is $20. For the price, there's a huge value here. It's a great start for Runic, who intends to build a free-to-play, massively multiplayer version of the game in the future.

Such is the case with The Ballad of Gay Tony, the second episode <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1408\" href=\"/rockstar-north/3010-1408/\" slug=\"rockstar-north\">                  Rockstar North</a> has released on the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">                 Xbox 360</a> for <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20457\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto-iv\">                Grand Theft Auto IV</a>, which continues to rely on that game's rapidly aging framework. But time isn't the only thing working against Gay Tony, as there's also an issue of quality. It's got all of the parts you'd need for the kind of hyperbolic criminal action experience <a data-ref-id=\"3025-6\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto/3025-6/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto\">               GTA</a> fans have come to expect, but there's a certain carelessness to the execution.<br/><br/>Like The Lost and Damned before it, The Ballad of Gay Tony takes place concurrently with the events of GTAIV, this time focusing on <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10920\" href=\"/luis-lopez/3005-10920/\" slug=\"luis-lopez\">              Luis Lopez</a> and his business partner <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10917\" href=\"/anthony-prince/3005-10917/\" slug=\"anthony-prince\">             Tony Prince</a>, known better within the criminal community as Gay Tony, though that's far and away the kindest name he's given. Together Lopez and Prince run a pair of high-end nightclubs in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-15\" href=\"/liberty-city/3035-15/\" slug=\"liberty-city\">            Liberty City</a>, but a slumping economy and the maturation of LC's gay community are putting a cramp on Tony's non-stop bacchanalia of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1708\" href=\"/cocaine/3055-1708/\" slug=\"cocaine\">           coke</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-218\" href=\"/pills/3055-218/\" slug=\"pills\">          pills</a>, and the pair end up owing money to the wrong people. Despite being an ex-con and an unrepentant murderer, Luis is definitely the more reasonable and responsible of the two, and playing as Luis, it's your job to sort things out--and of course, by \u201csort things out,\u201d I mean rob, blow shit up, and kill a whole mess of dudes.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1182181-046.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182181\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1182181-046.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182181\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1182181-046.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Say hello to the moral center of The Ballad of Gay Tony.</figcaption></figure>  This has emerged as one of the bothersome incongruities of the Grand Theft Auto protagonist. Like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-154\" href=\"/niko-bellic/3005-154/\" slug=\"niko-bellic\">         Niko Bellic</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8702\" href=\"/johnny-klebitz/3005-8702/\" slug=\"johnny-klebitz\">        Johnny Klebitz</a> before him, Luis Lopez is portrayed as a criminal who is a bit more insightful and self-aware than his peers, and postures as though he operates by some kind of moral code. Yet virtually every mission involves you doing the savage bidding of crazy and/or stupid characters that Luis ought to know better than to associate with. Even in comparison to Niko and Johnny, Luis comes off as kind of flat, without the thirst for revenge or the importance of brotherhood that, respectively, drove those characters. GTA protagonists are never the most interesting characters in their own games, but the fact that this isn't called The Ballad of Luis Lopez should be telling. <br/><br/>While the story is ostensibly about the dynamic between Tony and Luis, it also weaves in and out of the events of Grand Theft Auto IV, and the game is packed with callbacks and cameos, moreso than Lost and Damned. There are a few gems in there, but there's also a lot of forced coincidence, and at a point, it can be difficult to keep track of the extended cast of GTAIV. The Ballad of Gay Tony loosely revolves around Liberty City's nightclub lifestyle, but there's no specificity to the criminal experience being portrayed here, and it ends up feeling like a weak caricature of a good Grand Theft Auto game. Story threads about Luis' past, his relationship with his mother, and his dodgy reputation as a ladies' man are hinted at but go nowhere, and many of the colorful supporting characters are overly reminiscent of existing GTAIV characters, to the point that they actually introduce <a data-ref-id=\"3005-363\" href=\"/brucie-kibbutz/3005-363/\" slug=\"brucie-kibbutz\">       Brucie</a>'s older (but not bigger) brother <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12982\" href=\"/mori-kibbutz/3005-12982/\" slug=\"mori-kibbutz\">      Mori</a>, whose amped-up alpha behavior simply doesn't pay the same dividends it did the first time around.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1182193-gtaiv_tbogt_oktober_56.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182193\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1182193-gtaiv_tbogt_oktober_56.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182193\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1182193-gtaiv_tbogt_oktober_56.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1182193-gtaiv_tbogt_oktober_56.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Luis doesn't seem like the BASE jumping type, and isn't afraid to say as much.</figcaption></figure>  The gameplay in The Ballad of Gay Tony is, well, typical Grand Theft Auto stuff. If you played Grand Theft Auto IV, which is kind of a necessity before you get into Gay Tony, you're already familiar with the peculiarities of how the driving and character movement handle. The firefights tend to necessitate more judicious use of the game's cover mechanics, which feel clunkier than ever, largely because of the progress that has been made with cover mechanics by games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22420\" href=\"/uncharted-2-among-thieves/3030-22420/\" slug=\"uncharted-2-among-thieves\">  Uncharted 2</a> since the release of GTAIV. There are a few new activities you can engage in, most notably the addition of a parachute that you can use for BASE jumping, though you can also hit the driving range, engage in drug war firefights with Luis' hood friends, and go dancing in Tony and Luis' nightclubs. <br/><br/>Alongside the digital release of The Ballad of Gay Tony, Rockstar is putting out <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26616\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto-episodes-from-liberty-city/3030-26616/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto-episodes-from-liberty-city\">     Grand Theft Auto: Episodes From Liberty City</a>, which bundles both Gay Tony and The Lost and Damned onto one disc. This seems intended for players wary of or unconvinced by downloadable content, but the real value here is that you can expect market forces to push down the price of the disc much more quickly than its Microsoft-controlled digital counterparts. Considering the standalone nature of both episodes, I suppose it makes as much sense to load up that disc as the GTAIV disc to access the content.<br/><br/>Time and expectations have taken a certain toll on Grand Theft Auto IV, but all that aside, the bottom line for The Ballad of Gay Tony is that it's just not as good as the GTAIV experiences that preceded it. It feels like Rockstar has run out of tricks, and it has got its work cut out for it with whatever comes next for Grand Theft Auto.", "deck": "Without strong characters or story to rely on, The Ballad of Gay Tony highlights the ways in which open-world games have been refined and improved since the original release of Grand Theft Auto IV.", "dlc_name": "The Lost & Damned", "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-225/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20457/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/grand-theft-auto-iv/3030-20457/", "id": 20457, "name": "Grand Theft Auto IV"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-11-03 16:00:00", "release": null, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tekken-6-bloodline-rebellion-review/1900-226/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6508/1147924-cus02_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1147924\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5634765625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6508/1147924-cus02_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1147924\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6508/1147924-cus02_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can customize the fighters with all sorts of different parts.\u00a0</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3025-333\" href=\"/tekken/3025-333/\" slug=\"tekken\">Tekken</a> was once the bellwether for the coming generation of consoles. Seeing <a data-ref-id=\"3010-382\" href=\"/namco-bandai-games-inc/3010-382/\" slug=\"namco-bandai-games-inc\">Namco</a> develop home versions of the first few Tekken games that surpassed the arcade games upon which they were based was a magical moment back on the original <a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" slug=\"playstation\">PlayStation</a>. It was the moment where you could immediately see arcades becoming less relevant, as the machines hooked up to our TVs were now just as impressive as the stuff you had to drop quarters into to play. These days, it's not quite the trendsetter that it used to be, but the Tekken series keeps trucking along with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23833\" href=\"/tekken-6-bloodline-rebellion/3030-23833/\" slug=\"tekken-6-bloodline-rebellion\">Tekken 6</a>. In addition to also appearing on a non-Sony console (!), Tekken 6 has some very sharp fighting that builds onto the existing framework nicely with some cool new moves and characters. But just about everything that surrounds the actual fighting part of this fighting game is pretty disappointing, making this one strictly for Tekken fans who have enough local opposition to keep things interesting.<br/> <br/> The new fighters added to the fray include <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7575\" href=\"/lars-alexandersson/3005-7575/\" slug=\"lars-alexandersson\">Lars Alexandersson</a>, a Scandanavian dude with ties to the Mishima bloodline--which means he has excellent hair, obviously. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7576\" href=\"/alisa-bosconovitch/3005-7576/\" slug=\"alisa-bosconovitch\">Alisa Bosconovitch</a> is a pretty Japanese robot girl who can make chainsaws pop out of her arms. These are the two new \"Bloodline Rebellion\" fighters that appeared in the second arcade release, but if you've only been following the series via its home releases, then the four fighters from the first Tekken 6 release--<a data-ref-id=\"3005-1824\" href=\"/bob/3005-1824/\" slug=\"bob\">Bob</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2911\" href=\"/leo/3005-2911/\" slug=\"leo\">Leo</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2914\" href=\"/miguel-caballero-rojo/3005-2914/\" slug=\"miguel-caballero-rojo\">Miguel</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2908\" href=\"/zafina/3005-2908/\" slug=\"zafina\">Zafina</a>--are also new. The six additions to the roster fit pretty well and are fun to learn and fight with. If you count alternate versions of the same character (specifically, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3970\" href=\"/kuma/3005-3970/\" slug=\"kuma\">Kuma</a>'s second player \"outfit\" is really <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3971\" href=\"/panda/3005-3971/\" slug=\"panda\">Panda</a>), there are over 40 characters to choose from. It's a hefty roster, thick with the series' favorites.<br/> <br/> The fighting style in Tekken 6 hasn't changed dramatically. There are some changes to the combo system that allow for longer juggles, adding more depth to the combat for players who can pull off moves within very specific timing windows. For players who aren't already in too deep, though, Tekken has always felt friendly to new players, provided you're playing against players of the same skill level. Tekken 6 keeps up that tradition, even if the game's practice mode doesn't offer much to help you truly get a real understanding of the game, just a bunch of button-pressing notation that'll only really be of use to those already steeped in the franchise.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6508/1147936-demo17_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1147936\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5634765625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6508/1147936-demo17_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1147936\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/6508/1147936-demo17_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Big Pimpin'.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>When you combine Tekken's high-level play--which is all about precise timing--with Tekken 6's network code, you get varying degrees of disappointment. Even at its best, Tekken 6's online play feels like a completely different game, forcing you to think a second or two ahead and plan your moves out way too far in advance. It's not entirely unenjoyable, but you give up so much of what makes Tekken tick that it's really not worth it. If you want to play Tekken 6 competitively, plan on rounding up your friends and getting them all into one room. It's unfortunate, because the game has things like character-specific win/loss records, plus it's a good way to show off the items you've purchased and used to customize the look of your fighters. In unranked matches you can get up to four players in one game for a quarter match sort of setup, but considering the game usually can't handle a one-on-one matchup, getting spectators in there seems like a bad idea.<br/> <br/> Most of the other modes fall into the typical fighting game loadout, with a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3567\" href=\"/survival-mode/3015-3567/\" slug=\"survival-mode\">survival mode</a>, a team battle mode, and time attack. It also has a \"ghost battle\" mode, which is something that's popped up in different forms in recent Tekken releases. Here you can battle against different AI profiles (\"ghosts\") that come on the game disc. They're a bit more interesting to fight than the standard AI, plus you'll never run into the arcade mode's ridiculous end boss, which is certainly a plus. When you hit the game's online menu, it takes the ghosts that you've made by playing the game and uploads them. You can also download ghosts of other players. It's probably not perfect science--the ghost doesn't totally ape your style or anything like that--but it's a neat idea that lets you feel like you're fighting against, like, an answering machine version of the folks on your friends list. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be any sort of notifications about how well your ghosts are performing out on the Internet. Considering the game's sketchy online performance, the ghost battle mode is probably the best thing you can do with Tekken 6 unless you've got another player in the house.<br/> <br/> It's the first thing on the game's menu, but the Scenario Campaign mode is probably the worst thing in Tekken 6. It's an expansion on the old Tekken Force mode from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-11189\" href=\"/tekken-3/3030-11189/\" slug=\"tekken-3\">Tekken 3</a>, and it wraps a bad brawler around Tekken's fighting mechanics. While I appreciated the motion-comic-style intro, which details the \"who threw whom into which volcano\" parts of the Tekken storyline, the bulk of it, which involves Lars losing his memory, getting it back, and fighting a ton of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7591\" href=\"/jack/3005-7591/\" slug=\"jack\">Jack</a> robots, is pretty dull. Also, even though you can play as any character in the campaign mode, the story bits always put Lars back into the lead role.

While it's nice that you aren't forced to play as Lars for the entire game, it makes the whole thing feel extra sloppy.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9170/793328-tk6br04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-793328\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"1360\" style=\"width: 1360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9170/793328-tk6br04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-793328\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9170/793328-tk6br04.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9170/793328-tk6br04.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>For a robot lady, Alisa is pretty, OK? Look, I know that makes me a bad person, just LEAVE ME BE.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Though it's getting easier and easier to notice a lot of reused animations from previous games in the series, Tekken 6 looks really nice. The characters are big, the game moves really quickly, and the backgrounds are cool. The ability to customize characters is present, as it has been in the past, letting you do a lot of weird things to the fighters. If you want Paul to rock an eyepatch, or if you want <a data-ref-id=\"3005-534\" href=\"/kazuya-mishima/3005-534/\" slug=\"kazuya-mishima\">Kazuya</a>'s robot costume to have a glowing aura around it, you can spend some of the fight money you earn in the game's various modes to make all of that happen. The game has a pretty good soundtrack, though there's also a lot of stiff voice acting, especially in the campaign mode.<br/> <br/> The awkward campaign mode would be completely forgettable if Tekken 6 worked better online. But with it ranging from \"almost acceptable\" to \"pre-patch <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21519\" href=\"/the-king-of-fighters-xii/3030-21519/\" slug=\"the-king-of-fighters-xii\">King of Fighters XII</a>\" in connection quality, it's hard to recommend to anyone who doesn't already have a local crew of Tekken fiends at their disposal. If your crew is nuts for Tekken, though, the fighting in Tekken 6 is hot enough to make it worth your while.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><i>Disclosure: The game featured in this review is or was an advertised product on giantbomb.com.</i><i> </i><i>\u00a0</i>", "deck": "Tekken 6 is a great fighting game, but it's bogged down by a lot of extraneous baggage.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-226/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-23833/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tekken-6-bloodline-rebellion/3030-23833/", "id": 23833, "name": "Tekken 6: Bloodline Rebellion"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-11-03 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-77720/", "id": 77720, "name": "Tekken 6"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/band-hero-review/1900-227/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20362/1153433-setwidth639_band_hero_rocker_chick.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1153433\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56181533646322\" data-width=\"639\" style=\"width: 639px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20362/1153433-setwidth639_band_hero_rocker_chick.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1153433\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20362/1153433-setwidth639_band_hero_rocker_chick.jpg\"></a><figcaption>There are no real surprises on the in-game interface.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26367\" href=\"/band-hero/3030-26367/\" slug=\"band-hero\">Band Hero</a> is a product that feels like a commodity, something assembled by a marketing team concerned only with the market demands currently not met by the existing <a data-ref-id=\"3025-289\" href=\"/guitar-hero/3025-289/\" slug=\"guitar-hero\">Guitar Hero</a> brand.\u00a0But that cold, calculated feeling doesn't make it a bad game. This is the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24711\" href=\"/guitar-hero-5/3030-24711/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-5\">Guitar Hero 5</a> technology, with all of that game's strengths and weaknesses (along with a bit of new stuff), but whatever hard rock \"edge\" that series may have had has been smoothed over here, forming something that looks and sounds like it's three Coca-Cola cups and five Ford commercials away from being an <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1519\" href=\"/american-idol/3025-1519/\" slug=\"american-idol\">American Idol</a> game. The song list is more diverse than the typical Guitar Hero game, but that diversity means you'll probably enjoy a few songs here and there, but it's not going to be your favorite rhythm game ever. Also, the pop sensibility of its soundtrack makes for some awkward choices that really didn't need to appear in a full band game.<br/> <br/> The things that work about Guitar Hero 5 still work here. The party play mode lets you jump in or drop out of songs that start playing as soon as the game finishes booting up. That concept has been expanded to a karaoke-style sing-along mode that isn't really much different from the existing party mode, but having a menu option marked \"sing-along\" probably helps point it out to the uninitiated crowd that will probably enjoy the game the most. It's got the same sort of difficulty options as GH5 does, and while the game's choice of music is inherently less challenging than Dragonforce, pumping the difficulty up to expert gives you something that feels accurate to the source material. You can go online to fill out your career mode band, or you can engage in some of the same competitive multiplayer modes that have been in the Guitar Hero games. You can even fire up GHTunes, the make-your-own-music mode that lets you craft your own tracks with an interface that feels just as impenetrable and sounds just as bland as it ever has.<br/> <br/> But the feature set feels like it'll be wasted on the neophytes that are squarely in Band Hero's wheelhouse. That's not to say that rhythm game vets won't find anything on the soundtrack that they like, but by putting a virtual <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12355\" href=\"/taylor-swift/3005-12355/\" slug=\"taylor-swift\">Taylor Swift</a> in your game alongside tracks by Aly &amp; AJ and the Spice Girls, I'm going to guess that there's a specific audience that'll find that stuff appealing.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1135931-1249391772.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1135931\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.7541666666667\" data-width=\"720\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:175.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1099/1135931-1249391772.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1135931\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1099/1135931-1249391772.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Swift.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>But this isn't some sort of tween-girls-only party. There are songs from the Mighty Mighty Bosstones, The Go-Go's, Joan Jett, Culture Club, Poison, Styx, OK Go, and Santigold. How \"L.E.S. Artistes\" hasn't made it into a rhythm game until now is completely confusing to me, but it's probably my favorite track in the entire game. Unless you count \"Wannabe\" by the Spice Girls, of course.<br/> <br/> The catch is that there are some songs here that don't really fit into the four-piece setup of a full video game band. When you want to perform that Spice Girls song, you want to sing it. Playing the programmed drum track in something like that feels utterly pointless, and that track is better suited for a karaoke-only game. Same goes for \"Kung-Fu Fighting\" by Carl Douglas. Also--though I understand she's very popular with a certain segment--I'd rather take a medium-strength punch to the gut than play anything by Taylor Swift, who contributes three tracks. The couple of songs by No Doubt, however, are just fine. Swift, No Doubt, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12891\" href=\"/adam-levine/3005-12891/\" slug=\"adam-levine\">Adam Levine</a> of Maroon 5 show up in the polygonal flesh here, much like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11880\" href=\"/johnny-cash/3005-11880/\" slug=\"johnny-cash\">Johnny Cash</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12127\" href=\"/shirley-manson/3005-12127/\" slug=\"shirley-manson\">Shirley Manson</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12123\" href=\"/kurt-cobain/3005-12123/\" slug=\"kurt-cobain\">Kurt Cobain</a> did in Guitar Hero 5.<br/> <br/> The game allows for some importing and exporting with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20673\" href=\"/guitar-hero-world-tour/3030-20673/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-world-tour\">Guitar Hero World Tour</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25521\" href=\"/guitar-hero-smash-hits/3030-25521/\" slug=\"guitar-hero-smash-hits\">Guitar Hero: Smash Hits</a>, and Guitar Hero 5. They don't appear to be the full setlists from those games, but you can view each list of available tracks before you opt to go through the process to see if the songs you want to make available in Band Hero are on the list. There's also a built-in music store, and the game will read the Guitar Hero-compatible music you may have already purchased for other games.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20362/1153434-setwidth639_ssbh1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1153434\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56494522691706\" data-width=\"639\" style=\"width: 639px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/20362/1153434-setwidth639_ssbh1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1153434\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20362/1153434-setwidth639_ssbh1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/20362/1153434-setwidth639_ssbh1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The stages are a lot less filthy than Guitar Hero 5's.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Band Hero's pop sensibilities make for a different-looking game than the ones that Activision usually puts out. It's got a crisp look with backdrops that fit with the subject matter... meaning you'll start out on a mall tour. <i>Perfect</i>.

You can also create your own guys and unlock additional gear through the career mode.<br/> <br/> Like any other rhythm game, Band Hero is entirely dependent on your musical taste and how much you're willing to spend to acquire these 65 songs. If you don't like N.E.R.D., well hey, maybe you'll like Jesse McCartney, right? Actually, I'm totally messing with you. I'm pretty sure it's physically impossible for anyone to like Jesse McCartney.

It's an affection I find challenging to articulate without referencing past masters of idiots, explosives, and falling anvils like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-714\" href=\"/looney-tunes/3025-714/\" slug=\"looney-tunes\">               Looney Tunes</a>, or Joe Dante's <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3313\" href=\"/gremlins/3015-3313/\" slug=\"gremlins\"> <i>Gremlins</i></a>. There's just something about their free-spirited enthusiasm for madness that I either relate to or secretly envy. <br/><br/>So it pleases me greatly to see these manic, furry little agents of chaos trying something new in Rabbids Go Home. Comparisons to <a data-ref-id=\"3025-402\" href=\"/katamari-damacy/3025-402/\" slug=\"katamari-damacy\">             Katamari Damacy</a> are somewhat apt here, in that both games revolve around celestial aspirations and garbage collection, but the more significant parallel is the way both games carry a deep-seated quirkiness inherited from their country of origin. In the same way Katamari threw off surreal waves of distinctly Japanese peculiarity, Rabbids Go Home exudes a dizzy European flavor. It's a madcap, screwball game that will probably prove more pleasing to the palette in small tastes than in heaping mouthfuls, but it's still a giddy ride from start to finish.<br/><br/>The underlying premise in Rabbids Go Home is that, having spent the past three years gleefully tormenting the uptight, rule-abiding citizens of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-65\" href=\"/earth/3035-65/\" slug=\"earth\">          Earth</a>, the Rabbids are ready to pack it up and head home, which they seem to freely assume to be the Moon. Apparently lacking the knowledge of how they got here in the first place, the Rabbids tap into the pit-black depths of their ridiculousness and figure that the best way to get to the Moon is to build a giant pile of, well, whatever they can find. And so, a team of enterprising Rabbids grabs a shopping cart and heads out into the world of man, grabbing anything that's not bolted down, regardless of size. <br/><br/>     You'll guide this whirling dervish of wobbly wheels and constant, unnecessary screaming through a series of levels set largely in institutions of suffocating banality, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3035-2001\" href=\"/office-building/3035-2001/\" slug=\"office-building\">       office buildings</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1187\" href=\"/hospital/3035-1187/\" slug=\"hospital\">         hospitals</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1242\" href=\"/airport/3035-1242/\" slug=\"airport\">        airports</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1567\" href=\"/supermarket/3035-1567/\" slug=\"supermarket\">      grocery stores</a>, and the like. It's a world populated with timid, fearful humans whose frail, boxy frames betray literally just how \u201csquare\u201d they all are, and a considerable amount of the fun of Rabbids Go Home comes from the joy of watching and listening to the normals freak out at your antics. The levels are also filled with  <i>stuff</i>, and that stuff is divvied up into two size-based categories. Most of what you'll find on the ground--which includes, but is not limited to, octopi, dogs, pigeons, bats, soda bottles, fire extinguishers, toy cars, transistor radios, answering machines, and so on--falls under the XS (small) category. Additional XS stuff can also be found hidden in bushes, soda machines, and the like, and you can use the Rabbids' \u201cbwaaah\u201d attack, as well as a dash attack you learn later on, to knock the clothes clean off a person's back and add it to your coffers.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1089178-rgh_rabbids_screen_insanity.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1089178\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56280909990109\" data-width=\"1011\" style=\"width: 1011px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1089178-rgh_rabbids_screen_insanity.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1089178\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1089178-rgh_rabbids_screen_insanity.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0BWAAAAH!!</figcaption></figure> Your goal is always to get from one end of a level to the other, collecting as much XS pile-fodder as you can find, though most levels also feature a single XL (large) article to collect as well. Sometimes the XL stuff is just a big-ass thing to be collected at the end of the level, like a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-634\" href=\"/piano/3055-634/\" slug=\"piano\">     piano</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-651\" href=\"/statue/3055-651/\" slug=\"statue\">    statue</a>, a high-dive board, or a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3108\" href=\"/cow/3015-3108/\" slug=\"cow\">   cow</a>. Others will give you additional abilities, such as a jet engine that lets you rocket through airport terminals at high speeds, sucking up anything in your path, or an oxygen tent--complete with a feeble, liver-spotted patient inside--which you can use to float your way across otherwise impassible gaps. While most humans run screaming at the mere sight of the Rabbids, there are dangers to be avoided, including guard dogs, cacti, explosive inflatable bumpers, and several varieties of rubber-suited Verminators. <br/><br/>     The style of the gameplay in Rabbids Go Home doesn't easily conform to anything you've played before, and while the item collection concept remains a constant, unique twists are regularly introduced to keep it fresh. Sometimes you'll be presented with a time limit to race against as you try and collect as much stuff while still making it to the other end before time runs out, making it feel a bit like a racing game. Other times, it feels more like a platformer, with the challenge coming from simply navigating serpentine platforms and dangerous obstacles. You'll do some light puzzle-solving as well, such as figuring out how to use a trail of pea soup to get a janitorial robot to create passage to the next area.<br/><br/> If the gameplay was the defining characteristic in Rabbids Go Home, it really wouldn't be much to write about. It's got a snappy pace to it, and it rarely gets hard enough to kill that momentum with frustration, but it's the free-wheeling insanity of the Rabbids that makes this game so easy to like. The manic behavior of the Rabbids is reinforced by a desperate brass band soundtrack that sounds like it was conducted by John Philip Sousa on a piping-hot speed bender, which contrasts nicely against the occasional bits of corny licensed music that you'll hear the humans listening to. Suffice it to say, John Denver is well-represented there. The shopping cart careens everywhere it goes, with the stuff you've collected swaying about precariously as you turn. The Rabbids' innate curiosity will occasionally bring the game to a halt as they take comic interludes to poke and scream at some particular bit of whatever they've picked up. <br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1089180-rgh_rabbids_screen_scaredworker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1089180\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56188605108055\" data-width=\"1018\" style=\"width: 1018px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1089180-rgh_rabbids_screen_scaredworker.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1089180\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1089180-rgh_rabbids_screen_scaredworker.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1089180-rgh_rabbids_screen_scaredworker.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0BWAAAAAAAH!!!!!!!</figcaption></figure> Some of the most amusing stuff in Rabbids Go Home, though, has almost nothing to do with the actual gameplay. For example, you'll earn gifts on each level based on what percentage of the available stuff you collected. These gifts mostly unlock new tattoos and accessories you can adorn your Rabbids with, but rather than just dump you to a character customization menu, you'll suck the Rabbid you'd like to customize into your <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1304\" href=\"/wiimote/3055-1304/\" slug=\"wiimote\">  Wii Remote</a>, at which point the perspective cuts to the inside of your controller. You can then shake the Wii Remote around to watch the Rabbid knock against the walls, shake it off, and happily wait for more abuse. It's a surreal, metatextual touch that's totally superfluous to the gameplay, yet it's a key example of the kind of clever insanity that permeates Rabbids Go Home.<br/><br/> It's fair to say that Rabbids Go Home is a pretty shallow experience, and I'm uncertain if the novelty of the formula can support the weight of annualized sequels.

But rather than taking a ton of huge big-budget risks, Modern Warfare 2's multiplayer carefully builds upon the developer's previous success in ways that will astound people who have spent the last two years learning every corner of every map in the previous game. Instead, the risky stuff is saved for the single-player campaign, which offers tightly packed thrills and rock-solid gameplay, though the narrative is so wild it can get exhausting.<br/> <br/> The big draw in Modern Warfare 2 is its competitive multiplayer. Online, up to 18 players can meet up in several different types of matches, which cover the standard bases, like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-451\" href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" slug=\"deathmatch\">deathmatch</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">team deathmatch</a>, as well as <a data-ref-id=\"3015-25\" href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" slug=\"capture-the-flag\">capture the flag</a> and several other objective-style matches. The action takes place across 16 different maps that offer a variety of shapes, sizes, and styles. You'll fight across the rooftop of a large office building in Highrise, while Rust is a very small area designed for hectic free-for-alls, sort of like Shipment was in Call of Duty 4, but with a bit more verticality. Urban areas dominate the map list, but you'll also find large, mostly flat areas like Wasteland. If you're like me, and don't like getting shot at by snipers from large distances, you'd do well to stay low on Wasteland.<br/> <br/> The core activity in the multiplayer hasn't changed a bit. It's still about putting the sights of your gun on the enemy and carefully pulling the trigger. The little clicks that let you know that you've hit your target, or the way grenades clink around on the ground, regardless of surface, haven't changed at all, either. But everything that surrounds these basic concepts has been expanded and modified in a lot of interesting ways. The concept of selectable killstreak bonuses is probably the most interesting change. Like before, you can call in UAV drones to give yourself a better sense of where the enemies are currently located if you can get three kills in a row. You can also still call in airstrikes and helicopters. But you can also call in supply drops, send up counter-UAVs that block enemy radar, send in a harrier jet that hovers above the battle and guns down the opposition, or even call in a Predator missile strike, which lets you quickly control a missile as it drops from the sky, hopefully onto a cluster of enemies. At the outer edges of the killstreak lies a bonus that pretty much levels the playing field. It's a tactical nuke that, when deployed, destroys the arena, kills all the players, and ends the game, regardless of score. That might sound like a nuisance that greatly unbalances the game, but it puts a strong highlight onto the risk versus reward system that comes into play with these killstreaks.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1168795-mq_mw2_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1168795\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55263157894737\" data-width=\"760\" style=\"width: 760px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1168795-mq_mw2_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1168795\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23298/1168795-mq_mw2_03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Sure, the world might be close to ending, but there's always time for a swim.</figcaption></figure> To get that tactical nuke, you'll need to kill 25 people in a row. Without dying once. By comparison, a UAV is still three kills and a supply drop is just four. While it's certainly attainable by the most dedicated and savage players, it seems unlikely that a nuke will be deployed. First of all, a player would have to sacrifice a potentially more useful but lower quality killstreak to make room for the nuke. Even though you'll be able to unlock all of the killstreaks, you can still only select three at any given time. On top of that... <i>they'd have to go kill 25 players without dying</i>. Chances are, if a player is capable of doing that, that player's team is <i>probably</i> going to win anyway. Overall, the amount of kills required to call in the heavy artillery feels balanced. It also helps that you're able to more easily counter the enemy's air support.<br/> <br/> You can shoot down enemy UAVs now. That sounds like a minor thing, but it's a great illustration of how much more important things like rocket launchers are in multiplayer this time around. Keeping your movements a secret is as easy as firing a heat-seeker up at the little unmanned plane as it buzzes across the sky. Perks like Cold-Blooded help even more by making you invisible to both UAVs and other AI-controlled support, like sentry guns or attack helicopters. So while there's a greater variety of things in the sky that want to kill you, the individual soldier on the ground has been empowered, as well, keeping things level. Heck, even if you can't get the drop on most enemies with your rifle, shooting down their air support is still a great thing to do to help out your team.<br/> <br/> The system of class creation has been expanded in spots and heavily reworked in others. Perks that got a lot of complaints in COD4, like Martyrdom and Juggernaut, have been heavily reworked. For starters, Martyrdom is now a \"deathstreak\" bonus. If you die four times in a row without killing anyone, your next spawn will give you one instance of Martyrdom. This makes it a lot more rare, as opposed to COD4, where almost every player dropped a grenade every time they died. Juggernaut is gone completely, but there's a rough equivalent to it in Painkiller, another deathstreak perk that will spawn you with triple health if you die three times in a row... but the health bonus only lasts for ten seconds after spawning. Everything feels changed up just enough to feel totally fresh while still letting you outfit the type of character you want.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1177981-500x_hiresscreenshots4_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1177981\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1177981-500x_hiresscreenshots4_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1177981\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1177981-500x_hiresscreenshots4_03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1177981-500x_hiresscreenshots4_03.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Brazil looks awfully hellish at this time of year.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Additionally, each of the main perks has a \"Pro\" version that unlocks when you complete specific challenges while using that perk. So, for example, the Bling perk lets you put two attachments on your primary weapon. This means you can have a red dot sight and a silencer, or a heartbeat sensor and full metal jacketed ammo. By using Bling, you'll eventually get Bling Pro, which also lets you put two attachments on your secondary weapon. Commando increases the distance of your melee attack. Commando Pro does that while also preventing you from taking falling damage... which is totally awesome, by the way. All the challenges for weapons and perks mean that you always have something to shoot for that's just out of reach. As a result, you're always unlocking something and messing around with your created classes to find just the right balance of tactics and murderousness.<br/> <br/> That balance is the true core of Modern Warfare 2's online play. It's an exhilarating mix that forces tension by rewarding you for taking it slowly. Players that run around corners are just begging to get a knife stuck in their impatient faces. Slowing things down a bit lets you take it all in and, hopefully, get the drop on your opponents. It also makes you an easy target for snipers, Predator missiles, and a lot of other nasty stuff. While there have been plenty of tactical shooters out there, and there have been plenty of almost arcade-like shooters, too, Modern Warfare 2 blends the styles perfectly and has a feel all its own.<br/> <br/> The downside of all this is that with shooting that feels roughly identical to the previous Modern Warfare, there are a ton of players out there that are already way better than you are at shooting people. The player matching does its best to get you into games with similarly skilled players, but if you're looking for a different challenge that doesn't force you to play alone, there's Special Ops. This is a two-player cooperative mode with 23 missions, many of which reuse environments from the single-player portion of the game. When you've got someone with you--and players can revive one-another if they're shot up during the course of a mission--even the higher difficulty settings feel totally possible. While the main idea of staying alive and gunning down enemies crosses over into just about every mission, there are a lot of different things to do. One early mission has you perched on a rooftop, sniping soldiers as they rush your position. In the second wave, you're given a Predator missile kit, letting you lay down destruction from relative safety.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Other missions ape the style of the sniper missions from COD4 and MW2, letting you crawl through Chernobyl in a ghillie suit or try to hide out in snowy bushes while troops and dogs track you down. One mission has you split up with your associate. One of you remains on the ground while the other keeps him safe from the gunner seat of an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-667\" href=\"/lockheed-ac-130/3055-667/\" slug=\"lockheed-ac-130\">AC-130</a> airplane. Another has you shooting up a suburban neighborhood overrun by enemies from the gunner seat on a helicopter, while your buddy has to navigate treacherous cul-de-sacs on his way to an extraction point on top of what might as well be a TGI Fridays. You can even engage in a snowmobile race. You earn stars as you play, which are used to unlock additional tiers of missions. It's a fantastic addition to the game that extends the life of the campaign areas while also giving players who are still too scared of the competitive multiplayer a way to interact with friends.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1186435-951944_20091105_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186435\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/23298/1186435-951944_20091105_screen001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186435\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23298/1186435-951944_20091105_screen001.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/23298/1186435-951944_20091105_screen001.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>They'll fight for freedom, wherever there's trouble.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>There is, of course, a single-player campaign in Modern Warfare 2, as well. It picks up five years after the events of Call of Duty 4 and covers the exploits of a multinational group called Task Force 141. This is the group that includes <a data-ref-id=\"3005-23\" href=\"/john-soap-mactavish/3005-23/\" slug=\"john-soap-mactavish\">Soap</a>, the main player character from COD4. The game is set into motion by <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10832\" href=\"/vladimir-makarov/3005-10832/\" slug=\"vladimir-makarov\">Vladimir Makarov</a>, a Russian who used to work for the now-dead bad guy from COD4, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1297\" href=\"/imran-zakhaev/3005-1297/\" slug=\"imran-zakhaev\">Imran Zakhaev</a>. When Makarov slaps on his best American accent and shoots up a Russian airport, all hell breaks loose, worldwide. This includes attacks on American targets from the Russians. As <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11055\" href=\"/sgt-gary-roach-sanderson/3005-11055/\" slug=\"sgt-gary-roach-sanderson\">Gary \"Roach\" Sanderson</a>, a soldier working under \"Soap\" MacTavish, you'll attempt to fight back against the madness that Makarov has set in motion.<br/> <br/>Not that you'll play as \"Roach\" for the entire game. The campaign functions in the traditional format of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-82\" href=\"/call-of-duty/3025-82/\" slug=\"call-of-duty\">Call of Duty series</a>, so you'll be swapping between multiple player characters over the course of the single-player game. This lets the game switch between multiple theaters, showing you the hunt for Makarov going on in one part of the world while occasionally flashing back to Washington DC, where Russians are attacking en masse. In these sequences, you'll fight to secure territory, help evacuate civilians, and so on.<br/> <br/> If you remember Infinity Ward's previous game, then you know that Modern Warfare 2 would have to go pretty far overboard to top something like a nuclear blast that kills one of your player characters. Without getting too specific, let's say that the burning American monuments shown in trailers leading up to the game's release are just the beginning. A lot of crazy and kind of messed-up things go down over the course of your mission, to the point where the developers felt the need to include a \"Disturbing Content Warning\" that pops up at the beginning of the game. This only applies to one early sequence in the game, but the upshot is that you can skip this potentially disturbing sequence, if you like. That's an interesting way to handle something that, taken out of context, will probably look pretty bad. In the context of the game, though, it feels like an absolutely vital part of the story, told from a very interesting direction. In fact, it's this one sequence that sets all of the events of Modern Warfare 2 in motion. The larger issue is that the story feels like it's trying too hard to top the events of the previous game and shock you every 45 minutes or so. Some of the shocks are genuinely amazing, but there are so many different attempts at freaking you out that it starts to lose its impact and get a little tiring by the end of the campaign.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8515/1167757-juggernaut_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1167757\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56225528582616\" data-width=\"1277\" style=\"width: 1277px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8515/1167757-juggernaut_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1167757\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8515/1167757-juggernaut_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8515/1167757-juggernaut_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Juggernauts make the Special Ops mode... interesting.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>It'll probably take most players somewhere around five hours to get through Modern Warfare 2 on its default difficulty setting. In that time, you'll use Predator drones to shoot missiles at ground targets, you'll knock choppers out of the sky, you'll drive a snowmobile, and you'll walk alongside an armored vehicle, just like you did in the War Pig level of COD4, but this time it'll be in a very different setting. Overall, the campaign is a short, high-quality blast of action that's definitely worth seeing. Whether or not you'll go back through and play it again depends on how much of a glutton for punishment you are. Like the Call of Duty games before it, Modern Warfare 2's higher difficulty settings force you to play more and more carefully as you ratchet it up. If you're the type of patient player that loves to duck in and out of cover very quickly, you'll enjoy it. I ended up having a great time on the game's standard setting and got very little pleasure out of the harder options.<br/><br/> Modern Warfare 2 is a sharp-looking game with a real dedication to keeping its frame rate up. Its smooth frame rate is a real asset that makes the action look great, but it's also backed up by some good, solid animation and large areas that fill up with enemies. All hell breaks loose at several spots in the campaign, and the technology behind the action is more than up to the challenge. While it isn't an order of magnitude greater than Call of Duty 4 at first glance, the larger scope of some areas feel like things that might not have been possible before, at least not without sacrificing texture or model quality.<br/> <br/> Everything is also supported by a great, cinematic soundtrack, a lot of great gunfire and explosion sounds, and some strong voice work out of its cast. The returning voices make the world feel familiar and help tie it to Call of Duty 4. But work by guys like <a data-ref-id=\"3040-61906\" href=\"/lance-henriksen/3040-61906/\" slug=\"lance-henriksen\">Lance Henriksen</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-81910\" href=\"/keith-david/3040-81910/\" slug=\"keith-david\">Keith David</a> also add a lot. The lines are delivered with a certain level of conviction that helps sell the plot, even when it starts to spin out of control. That said, the nearly constant use of the phrase \"Oscar Mike,\" mostly by the American troops, starts to get really distracting. In case you were wondering, it means \"On the Move.\" Apparently the script writers watched a lot of <i>Generation Kill</i>, which certainly contributed to the phrase entering the civilian lexicon.<br/> <br/> Since it's building on such a strong framework, it might be hard to go completely nuts over the release of Modern Warfare 2.\u00a0But if you've played a significant amount of Infinity Ward's last game, the improvements are numerous and they are supremely satisfying. If you've ever been interested in a first-person shooter, buy this game.", "deck": "To outsiders, the changes in Modern Warfare 2 might sound minor.

The biggest change is that the touchscreen minigames, which have you hot-wiring cars, assembling sniper rifles, and digging through trash cans, have been reworked to function with the PSP's more traditional controls. Some of those minigames work better than others in their new form, but it's such a minor part of the overall game that it doesn't really add or detract from the overall experience, which is still great.<br/> <br/> The technical aspects of Chinatown Wars were impressive on the DS, and the PSP version looks quite a bit sharper and cleaner than the original release. It maintains the same top-down perspective that fueled the original Grand Theft Auto games, which may seem a bit weird to PSP owners, since Sony's handheld has received GTA games that look a lot more like their console counterparts. Chinatown Wars is better than those games, both because it has a cool, stylized look and because it simply plays better this way on a handheld.<br/> <br/> The PSP version of the game also makes some interesting additions and changes that help adapt this DS game to a system that only has one screen that doesn't do anything, no matter how hard you stab it with a stylus. Without a second screen to fill with information, the game's minimap is a bit hard to deal with. So the smartest thing you can do is go into the options and turn on \"World GPS,\" which draws route lines on the actual road. Unfortunately, you'll still have to go into the pause menus and look at the map to plot destinations when you're not on a mission. Loading up the menus takes a little bit of time, and navigating the map to drop waypoints isn't all that slick with the PSP's controls.<br/> <br/> However, putting up with menu navigation is pretty minor in the grand scheme of things. GTA: Chinatown Wars is a quality product that gives you a camera perspective and gameplay that fits really well on a handheld. It might not be quite as ambitious as attempting to completely duplicate the console experience (like the \"<a data-ref-id=\"3030-6731\" href=\"/grand-theft-auto-liberty-city-stories/3030-6731/\" slug=\"grand-theft-auto-liberty-city-stories\">Stories</a>\" set of PSP releases did), but it works wonderfully and catches plenty of the GTA experience, despite the different perspective and still-frame cutscene style.

Traveller's Tales has taken this chocolate-and-peanut-butter idea in an intriguing, peculiar direction with <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25765\" href=\"/lego-rock-band/3030-25765/\" slug=\"lego-rock-band\">   LEGO Rock Band</a>, which is pretty much exactly what it sounds like: a standard <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">        Rock Band</a> experience that's been coated in those distinctive plastic building blocks.\u00a0 <br/>\u00a0<br/>Unlike Traveller's Tales previous LEGO efforts, the LEGO element feels more like cutesy window dressing here than an integral part of the experience. With the LEGO license and the E10+ rating, LEGO Rock Band is ostensibly an all-ages, family-friendly angle on the Rock Band formula. But in pursuing an everything-for-everybody design, the game ends up with a track list that's just as unfocused as <a data-ref-id=\"3010-78\" href=\"/activision/3010-78/\" slug=\"activision\">       Activision</a>'s competing <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26367\" href=\"/band-hero/3030-26367/\" slug=\"band-hero\">      Band Hero</a>, though without that game's overall polish. There's nothing inherently faulty about the underlying ideas here, but in execution LEGO Rock Band is ultimately less than the sum of its parts.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>LEGO Rock Band largely abides by the basic structure that you've come to know from the other Rock Band games. You've got full support for guitar, bass, drums, and vocals, and you can play with any combination thereof in either a free play mode or the game's story mode. Other than the addition of a new super easy difficulty and a generally more forgiving level of difficulty than the mainline Rock Band games, the only real significant difference gameplay-wise is the LEGO Recovery Mode. Usually, when you fail out of a song in Rock Band, it requires another player to sacrifice some portion of his or her overdrive meter to bring you back into the action. With the LEGO Recovery Mode, you can earn your second chance to keep going after you've failed out by successfully hitting a series of notes. Beyond making it possible to keep yourself going when you're playing solo, it's not necessarily a better way to handle keeping everyone in the game, but it's different. <br/>\u00a0<br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1175315-500x_no_hud_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1175315\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.564\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1175315-500x_no_hud_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1175315\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1175315-500x_no_hud_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>We will, we will, BLOCK YOU!</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">Alternately, the story mode in LEGO Rock Band feels like a more confined version of the world tour mode that has helped Rock Band turn its persistent experience into more than a list of songs to be played through. The issues I take with the story mode are twofold. While you still open up new songs, new venues, new modes of transport, and additional support staff for your band as you play, you get none of the globe-trotting feel of being a rock band out on tour. It is, admittedly, primarily an issue of presentation. The menus just move from one room to another inside your Rock Den, which serves as a customizable base of operation for your band, rather than some kind of world map. My other big issue is that I felt there were more choke points in the story progression where I found myself forced to play, or in the more bothersome circumstances, replay songs that I had little interest in playing in order to advance. <br/>\u00a0<br/>This second issue is exacerbated by the fact that the track list in LEGO Rock Band is just all over the place in a way that makes me suspect that the folks behind this game weren't really sure who they were making this game for. Goofy crowd-pleasers like Bon Jovi's \u201cYou Give Love a Bad Name\u201d, Queen's \u201cWe Are the Champions\u201d and \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d, Carl Douglas' \u201cKung Fu Fighting\u201d, and Ray Parker Jr.'s \u201cGhostbusters\u201d seem to be aimed at a more casual crowd than the usual Rock Band game, and that seems like the right direction for LEGO Rock Band. But then the novelty songs and Top 40 stuff is accompanied by b-sides from bands like Counting Crows, Blink 182, Supergrass, and Good Charlotte, and a number of bands that I've just simply never heard of. Maybe that's a personal failing, but I feel like a track list that's meant to be Fun For the Whole Family should be more consistently familiar and hummable. To its credit, LEGO Rock Band has support for Rock Band DLC, opening up the music you can play here. You can also export the track list out of LEGO Rock Band for an additional, fairly nominal fee, making them available for play in other Rock Band games that support general DLC. In the context of a larger Rock Band play list, the songs available here make a whole lot more sense. <br/>\u00a0<br/> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1156582-lego_rock_band_playstation_3_ps3_023.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1156582\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/45471/1156582-lego_rock_band_playstation_3_ps3_023.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1156582\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/45471/1156582-lego_rock_band_playstation_3_ps3_023.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/45471/1156582-lego_rock_band_playstation_3_ps3_023.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0I've officially run out of LEGO puns. Enjoy this screenshot on its own merits!</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">For as fundamentally similar to past Rock Band games as this is, there's something about the basic gameplay in LEGO Rock Band that just feels off. It's pretty subtle, and if you haven't played a whole lot of Rock Band, you might not notice, but it's somehow more mechanical, like there's more of a disconnect between what you're hearing and how you're playing.<br/><br/>In the end, LEGO Rock Band just doesn't do a terrific job of justifying its existence as a standalone game. The LEGO hook doesn't go too far beyond the superficial novelty of watching little Lego people jump around bombastic venues as you play, and too much of the music just feels mismatched to the underlying concept. Even if you're looking for an experience that's more kid-friendly, there are still better ways to rock.<br/></p>", "deck": "LEGO Rock Band's charming premise crumbles under the weight of a scattered track list and a clumsy execution that doesn't do justice to either LEGOs or Rock Band.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-231/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25765/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/lego-rock-band/3030-25765/", "id": 25765, "name": "LEGO Rock Band"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-11-13 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83234/", "id": 83234, "name": "LEGO Rock Band"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/new-super-mario-bros-wii-review/1900-232/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1191004-undernsmbwii.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1191004\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5475\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:54.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1191004-undernsmbwii.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1191004\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1191004-undernsmbwii.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The penguin suit lets you walk normally on ice.\u00a0</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-26841\" href=\"/new-super-mario-bros-wii/3030-26841/\" slug=\"new-super-mario-bros-wii\">New Super Mario Bros. Wii</a> is kind of a goofy title, but it tells you just about everything you need to know about <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a>'s latest release. It's new. It's got those Super Mario Bros. guys in it. And it's for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-36\" href=\"/wii/3045-36/\" slug=\"wii\">Wii</a>. The nostalgist in me wants to stop right there and say \"That's all you need to know, get to a store!\" But that'd be pretty irresponsible. You should probably know for sure that this Wii sequel to the DS release of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8224\" href=\"/new-super-mario-bros/3030-8224/\" slug=\"new-super-mario-bros\">New Super Mario Bros.</a> updates the classic side-scrolling formula in most of the same ways that the DS game did back in 2006. You'll be expected to collect big coins and find the occasional secret exit when you're attempting to play seriously. But there's also an outrageously chaotic multiplayer mode that feels like an entirely different game.<br/> <br/> The story and setting for New Super Mario Bros. Wii feels very rooted in the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\" href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" slug=\"super-mario-bros-3\">Super Mario Bros. 3</a> style of airships, world maps, suits, and the Koopa kids, who serve as both mid-bosses and bosses for each of the game's eight main worlds and impede your progress as you attempt to save <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">Princess Peach</a> yet again. But this isn't a remake of SMB3. You'll see some <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1334\" href=\"/super-mario-world/3030-1334/\" slug=\"super-mario-world\">Super Mario World</a>-era stuff sprinkled in there, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a>'s abilities include the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1532\" href=\"/ground-pound/3015-1532/\" slug=\"ground-pound\">butt stomp</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1565\" href=\"/triple-jump/3015-1565/\" slug=\"triple-jump\">triple jump</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5\" href=\"/wall-jump/3015-5/\" slug=\"wall-jump\">wall jump</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2017\" href=\"/spin-attack/3015-2017/\" slug=\"spin-attack\">spin attack</a>. So there's more to it than just running, jumping, and throwing the occasional <a data-ref-id=\"3055-120\" href=\"/fireball/3055-120/\" slug=\"fireball\">fireball</a>, and most of the variety comes from the game's power-ups. Most of them are pretty standard for the series, including the fire flower and the mini-mushroom, which makes you small. The more interesting additions are things like the propeller suit, which gives you a burst of flight when you shake the Remote, the ice flower, which shoots ice balls that freeze enemies, and the penguin suit, which lets you walk normally on ice, lets you slide on your stomach for long distances, and also lets you shoot the same ice balls that the ice flower offers.<br/> <br/> As you make your way from one end of this adventure to the other, you'll pass through the standard array of themed levels. Yes, you read that right, New Super Mario Bros. Wii has an ice world and a fire world, a combination so potent that I almost feel like an idiot for even writing about it. Seriously, I might as well just write \"This game has coins in it and when you collect 100 of them, you're awarded with an extra life, which the game calls a 1UP.\" My point is that if you've been playing games for awhile, you already know most of what to expect from New Super Mario Bros. Wii. It doesn't rock the boat too much.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1191019-brosnsmbwii.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1191019\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56054279749478\" data-width=\"958\" style=\"width: 958px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1191019-brosnsmbwii.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1191019\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1191019-brosnsmbwii.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This coin battle stage takes things back to the original Mario Bros.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Unsurprisingly, that's also one of the game's best qualities. With this product, Nintendo is simply reselling your childhood to you in a way that's playable on its latest hardware. Or, if you're still a child, it's doing the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1312\" href=\"/disney-interactive-inc/3010-1312/\" slug=\"disney-interactive-inc\">Disney</a> thing by repacking its history in ways that are still palatable. By modernizing some bits around the edges, this doesn't feel like some kind of cheap rehash or shameless cash-in. By giving you more control over the characters via the additional jumping moves and power-ups like the ice flower, which lets you freeze enemies into blocks of ice that you can then stand on, the game provides a path for players who want to play with reckless abandon, holding down the run button at all times and just doing everything they can to stay alive during a mad break for the finish line.\u00a0Playing this way is fairly doable if you've grown up alongside the series and still have most of your platforming wits about you, mostly because the game isn't terribly difficult and rarely asks you to do anything out-of-the-ordinary unless you're hellbent on finding every secret exit and collecting every last star coin, which opens up bonus levels at the end of the game. I also found it to be a lot more fun to play a little recklessly, and the way the game constantly throws extra lives at you means that you'll have plenty of backup if a section gets rough.<br/>\u00a0<br/>For players who don't want the added intensity, taking it slower is a viable, and significantly easier option. Patient players probably won't die very often. If you're an absolute beginner and manage to die eight times on the same level, the game will offer to show you a route through the level. You can interrupt the playback of this \"super guide\" at any point and take control yourself, or you can just let it play through the entire level. This will let you skip levels, but you won't get any star coins if you don't do it yourself. But it's hard to imagine any but the most novice of players needing to heavily rely on this option, given the game's relative ease. It's certainly not as hard as Super Mario World or Super Mario Bros. 3, if you're looking for some point of comparison.<br/> <br/> You can also play through the levels with up to three other players, who take on the role of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">Luigi</a> and two Toads. Though the levels and the end goal remain the same, playing with other people turns New Super Mario Bros. Wii into an entirely different game. Players can't pass through one-another, and you can pick up and toss other players, too. Combined with a bunch of tight platforms and a level or two that kills players if they get scrolled off of the screen, this all becomes complete and total chaos with players bumping each other into open holes by mistake or, if your friends are particularly vicious, tossing each other into those same holes on purpose. Carefully collecting coins and working your way through the worlds goes right out the window and you're basically forced to hold on and enjoy the ride as you bop and bump each other through the levels.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1173003-nsmbw003.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1173003\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56073211314476\" data-width=\"601\" style=\"width: 601px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17172/1173003-nsmbw003.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1173003\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1173003-nsmbw003.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17172/1173003-nsmbw003.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>There are a lot of rotating platforms and other tricky stuff to deal with in the later levels.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>That said, there are ways to actually cooperate, such as forming human towers and jumping off of each other to get the top player up to some high, normally unreachable area. But coordinating that stuff takes more patience than I've got. Perhaps it depends on who you're playing with. Either way, it makes a strong case for offline multiplayer, as the only thing that would make all of this more difficult would be if the other three players were on the other side of a voice chat instead of right there alongside you, occasionally coordinating a strategy or two. The game really comes alive when you're playing in a group, but it's so crazy that if you're trying to play seriously, it'll just be frustrating. Also, the game pauses for a split-second whenever anyone grabs a power-up or dies. If you're mid-jump or just really focusing on what you're doing while another player is off dying or getting mushrooms, the pause is really disorienting. But if you're just looking to screw around and have a good time, you'll have some fun with the multiplayer modes.<br/> <br/> Visually, New Super Mario Bros. Wii looks fine, but not everything stands up to close inspection. The polygonal player models look a little funky at times, especially if you're playing at 480i. It probably depends on what sort of TV you're using, but it didn't always look technically proficient on larger screens. That said, the artistic direction offers the high-color worlds of wonder that you've come to expect from a Mario game. As long as you aren't getting up close and personal with the on-screen action, it looks just fine. The game's soundtrack is peppered with yet another batch of remixes of songs from throughout the Mario canon.<br/> <br/> New Super Mario Bros. Wii doesn't make dramatic changes to the \"New\" game that was released on the DS, but by offering more substantial multiplayer and a set of new levels to conquer, it stands out as one of the Wii's best.

If you're the sort of person who loved the unique cooperative action and eerie undead trappings of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20690\" href=\"/left-4-dead/3030-20690/\" slug=\"left-4-dead\">  the original</a>--but may have felt that game was a little thin on value--know this much-improved sequel has more than enough new content to justify its status as a full-priced standalone package. Conversely, this is very much an incremental improvement over Left 4 Dead, with more campaigns, more enemy types, more multiplayer modes, more and better weapons--more of everything but, in essence, the same game. If the first one didn't do much for you, this sequel won't make a significantly different attempt to win you over, either. Based on those two statements, you might already know whether or not you'll want to bother with Left 4 Dead 2 at all.<br/> <br/>  If you're neither of those people, let me fill in some gaps. Left 4 Dead 2 is still all about the plight of four unlikely survivors brought together by the rigors of the zombie apocalypse, battling their way through a series of loosely connected scenarios rife with dramatic scripted action sequences and unpredictable undead attacks. Valve has given this sequel a more coherent cultural backdrop by setting it entirely in the South, with an arduous trek that leads you from Savannah, Georgia through a rundown old theme park, the bayou, an antebellum plantation, and right on into a New Orleans so overrun by the undead menace that it's also under assault by what remains of the nation's uninfected emergency military forces. You get everything from elevated swamp houses to a soundtrack filled with slide guitars and \"When the Saints Go Marching In\" to drive home exactly where it is you're fighting through.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1192856-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.46.02_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192856\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56181533646322\" data-width=\"1278\" style=\"width: 1278px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1192856-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.46.02_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192856\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1192856-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.46.02_pm.png\"></a><figcaption> \u00a0Well, what else would  you use to kill zombies onstage? \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3010-1374\" href=\"/valve-corporation/3010-1374/\" slug=\"valve-corporation\">    Valve</a> has once again spun an eminently convincing yarn of the zombie-fueled end of mankind, with innumerable subtle but cumulatively effective ways to tell you how bad the outbreak has gotten. From the panicked scrawling on safehouse walls to infected riot cops and hazmat-wearing emergency management zombies who assault you, it's apparent at every turn that this has gotten bad. Real bad. And yet with no plodding cutscenes or even a hint of real exposition, Left 4 Dead 2 remains the most chilling, believable image of undead armageddon I can remember seeing in a game. Considering how many other zombie games are out there these days, that ought to tell you something.<br/> <br/>  In the same sense, a game so focused on expertly paced cooperative action might well star a group of nameless, voiceless characters who only exist to wield shotguns, so it's further testament to the fine characterizations in Left 4 Dead 2 that I want to even bother introducing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11061\" href=\"/nick/3005-11061/\" slug=\"nick\"> Nick</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11062\" href=\"/rochelle/3005-11062/\" slug=\"rochelle\"> Rochelle</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11060\" href=\"/coach/3005-11060/\" slug=\"coach\"> Coach</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11063\" href=\"/ellis/3005-11063/\" slug=\"ellis\"> Ellis</a>. They're a ragtag group every bit as memorable as the first game's team--perhaps even more so thanks to Coach's burly, world-weary witticisms and Ellis' incessant Southern-fried yammering. Valve wrote and recorded a fair sight more dialogue for this sequel that humanizes the player characters and drives home the desperation of their struggle. For all the comic relief that comes from Coach and Ellis, the first time you hear Nick growl \"Goddamnit, goddamnit, god<i>damnit</i>!\" you realize just how dire this thing is.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1192847-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.45.30_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192847\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56181533646322\" data-width=\"1278\" style=\"width: 1278px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1192847-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.45.30_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192847\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1192847-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.45.30_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1192847-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.45.30_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption> Steering players around as the jockey is hilarious.  </figcaption></figure>  If you're familiar with the first game, none of this is news to you; this sequel is more of the same, in a case where the thing everyone wanted out of the first game was, in fact, more. So let me break down the nuts and bolts: Left 4 Dead 2 is simply a bigger game than its predecessor. You've got five meaty, involved campaigns to the first game's four, each of which has a unique identity and a lot of great moments. Want to blast zombies in the Tunnel of Love? Fight your way through a raging thunderstorm that you can barely see through? Make a ridiculous last stand in the middle of a deserted rock 'n roll stage show? You'll do all of that and a lot more.<br/> <br/>  The little additions to the core gameplay add up to a big improvement. There's a huge list of new firearms in the game that have a great feel to them, and the inclusion of melee weapons that replace your sidearm is a seemingly obvious but nonetheless brilliant move. The melee weapons have a weight and potency that lets you swing through scores of zombies in seconds, and while it's fun enough to wield a chainsaw, machete, or fireman's axe, there's a far more gleeful absurdity to doing the same thing with frying pans and guitars. There's a ton of new gear that gives you more survival options as well, including an adrenaline shot that speeds up healing and revivals, a bottle of boomer bile you can hurl onto special infected like the tank to make the horde attack them, and a defibrillator that will bring a dead survivor right back to life where they fell.<br/> <br/>   The three new special infected types might collectively be the thing that most changes up the survivor/infected dynamic. The <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11752\" href=\"/the-spitter/3005-11752/\" slug=\"the-spitter\"> spitter</a> delivers a nasty area-of-effect acid pool that the subversive <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12184\" href=\"/the-jockey/3005-12184/\" slug=\"the-jockey\"> jockey</a> can ride a human straight into. And the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11753\" href=\"/the-charger/3005-11753/\" slug=\"the-charger\"> charger</a> can barrel out of nowhere to snare one survivor and separate them from the pack, then pound the hell out of them for massive damage before the other humans can do much about it. These new infected mix it up with old favorites like the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-7313\" href=\"/the-boomer/3005-7313/\" slug=\"the-boomer\"> boomer</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8537\" href=\"/the-smoker/3005-8537/\" slug=\"the-smoker\"> smoker</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-8535\" href=\"/the-tank/3005-8535/\" slug=\"the-tank\"> tank</a> to make cooperative runs through the campaigns trickier and more interesting. They definitely keep you on your toes.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1125241-2009_09_04_14_09_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1125241\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1125241-2009_09_04_14_09_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1125241\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1125241-2009_09_04_14_09_02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1125241-2009_09_04_14_09_02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> \u00a0OK, now that is\u00a0scary.</figcaption></figure>  Despite all these improvements--and the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2539\" href=\"/ai-director/3015-2539/\" slug=\"ai-director\"> AI Director</a>'s efforts to randomize the enemy and item placement, a function it continues to perform admirably--I didn't feel the need to play through the campaigns in a purely cooperative setting more than two or three times. Those who relish a ludicrous challenge will appreciate the \"Realism\" option, which really amps up the difficulty by doing things like making all the zombies significantly harder to kill (even the common ones), and removing the other survivors' outlines that normally let you see them through walls. I tried playing a campaign on Expert difficulty with Realism mode enabled, and my whole group lasted roughly 90 seconds. We wiped out before we even saw any special infected. It's ridiculous. The game also isn't much fun by yourself, since the AI isn't nearly as capable as a real player, and, let's face it, you can't talk to it, either. So unless you're the sort of masochist who enjoys playing the same levels over and over at increasingly more punishing difficulty levels--and you can consistently find at least three other like-minded individuals--you probably won't go back to each campaign more than a couple of times, either, once you've seen all their admittedly wonderful tricks the first time or two.<br/> <br/>    Once again, it's the competitive multiplayer modes that give Left 4 Dead 2 its longevity. It's fortunate the fantastic Versus mode now works in all five campaigns right out of the box, letting you take control of the special infected to stop the survivors from reaching the next safehouse. Just as those new infected add a lot to the co-op against the AI, they also make Versus a lot more fun and varied, since you've now got six playable zombie types to cycle through instead of only three. There are some effective (and really funny) strategies you can pull off by combining different infected characters' special attacks together, and the greater overall range of tactical options for the infected really keeps the survivors on their toes. They'll need every bit of that new gear to win.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1192857-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.44.50_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192857\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56181533646322\" data-width=\"1278\" style=\"width: 1278px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1192857-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.44.50_pm.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1192857\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1192857-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.44.50_pm.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1192857-screen_shot_2009_11_17_at_12.44.50_pm.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption> \u00a0Dismembering zombies is a really satisfying new way to take them out quickly. </figcaption></figure>  As good as Versus is, it's not a mode you can just sit down and play casually. You're effectively playing through a whole campaign twice, so you'll need a good 90 minutes to get through an entire match from start to finish. Luckily, there are now some better options for getting a shorter but still satisfying Left 4 Dead experience. The Survival mode that Valve patched into the original game makes a return here, letting you and three others fight off nonstop, brutal waves of zombies to see how long you can last. (Hint: not very long.) Survival is intense, but it's also sort of a one-trick pony.<br/> <br/>   Then there's Scavenge mode, which is my single favorite new thing in Left 4 Dead 2. The survivors start out with 90 seconds on the clock, grouped around a centrally located generator. They have to move out into the map to pick up cans of gas and dump them into that generator, each time adding an extra 20 seconds to the clock. The infected players, of course, have to stop them. Scavenge moves fast--if you shut the survivors out, the round only lasts 90 seconds--and there's a ton of potential for frantic tension between the two sides. A hunter, jockey, or charger can set up an effective ambush near the generator, stopping a survivor from delivering that last crucial gas can. Spitters can douse dropped cans to destroy them, and since cans don't regenerate, that quickly lowers the survivors' score potential. But they have a small advantage in sudden death, which continues the round after time hits zero, as long as one survivor is still holding a can. When there are precious few seconds on the clock, Scavenge becomes a mad dash to get a gas can into your hands and keep it there to keep the round from ending. Scavenge is a fast-paced, skill-intensive mode that's good for a lot of teamwork and a lot of laughs. It's probably the last thing in Left 4 Dead 2 I'll keep playing before I retire the game for good.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31838/1125247-darkcarnival.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1125247\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.64723247232472\" data-width=\"1355\" style=\"width: 1355px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:64.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/31838/1125247-darkcarnival.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1125247\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31838/1125247-darkcarnival.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/31838/1125247-darkcarnival.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> \u00a0You must be this tall... to die! I stole that joke from Valve.</figcaption></figure>   Valve continues to be one of the few first-person shooter developers doing right by both the PC and consoles--or at least the Xbox 360, since Left 4 Dead still hasn't graced the PlayStation 3 as yet. Aside from a few isolated spots where the frame rate drops to uncomfortable levels, the 360 game is a smooth, fine-looking way to play the game. I had infrequent issues connecting to my friends' open lobbies, but no more than you'd expect with any multiplayer game on Xbox Live. The PC version, on the other hand, looks significantly sharper than the 360 game and also runs a lot more smoothly on a decent system. Better, the multiplayer framework offers the best of both worlds, straddling the line between console-style \"quick game\" matchmaking that gets you into a game immediately, and dedicated-server support that ties into Steam groups to quickly show you any servers your friends and groupmates are running. Ultimately you should play Left 4 Dead 2 on the platform you have the most friends playing it on, but all other things being equal, the PC game is the one to get.<br/> <br/>  Left 4 Dead 2 feels like the game Valve should have shipped this time last year, and if they had, I don't think you would have heard a word about a dearth of content hampering this otherwise fantastic multiplayer experience. And you certainly can't make that claim now. Anyone who's complaining about this sequel being an overpriced expansion might as well hang it up; there is simply far more content by volume in this package than in the original. The core of Left 4 Dead may have lost some of its newness in the last 12 months, but the wealth of additions in this sequel ought to keep you blasting zombies and munching on brains for a good long while. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "If more Left 4 Dead is what you're after, this sequel has it.

The original was an imperfect gem, a game with more heady concept and spark than staying power--qualities that, frankly, make it the ideal candidate for a more potent sequel. It would seem that the developers at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1559\" href=\"/ubisoft-montreal-studios/3010-1559/\" slug=\"ubisoft-montreal-studios\">                     Ubisoft Montreal</a> have put considerable thought into how to bring some color and depth to the detailed and occasionally brilliant sketch work provided by the original Assassin's Creed, and that effort has paid off generously. <br/>\u00a0<br/><a data-ref-id=\"3030-22928\" href=\"/assassins-creed-ii/3030-22928/\" slug=\"assassins-creed-ii\">       Assassin's Creed II</a> has a bit more to offer those already familiar with the high-concept intricacies of the original, where you played as a bold and highly serious young assassin named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-48\" href=\"/altair/3005-48/\" slug=\"altair\">                   Altair</a> living in the Holy Land during the Crusades. Although, <i>really</i>  you were playing as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-305\" href=\"/desmond-miles/3005-305/\" slug=\"desmond-miles\">                  Desmond Miles</a>, an average every-man strapped into a genetic memory machine called the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-359\" href=\"/animus/3055-359/\" slug=\"animus\">                 Animus</a>.

If all this premise is just whizzing clean over your head, you may want to read up before jumping in here. Assassin's Creed II makes some token effort to catch up new players, but after a quick summary reel, it picks right back up from the final shot of the first Assassin's Creed and doesn't look back. <br/> <p style=\"\">\u00a0<br/>After an efficiently eventful opening, it's established that, with the Templars on the move and Desmond in the custody and employ of the Assassins, it's time for Desmond to start his training to become a proper, real-live killer. In a plot device of distinctly <a data-ref-id=\"3025-659\" href=\"/the-matrix/3025-659/\" slug=\"the-matrix\"> <i>Matrixian</i></a>  construction, Desmond trains by hopping into the Animus (well,  <i>an</i> Animus, anyway). This time he's playing through some of the more eventful moments in the life of an ancestor named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10269\" href=\"/ezio-auditore-di-firenze/3005-10269/\" slug=\"ezio-auditore-di-firenze\">              Ezio Auditore</a>, a privileged young man living a rambunctious, devil-may-care life in Renaissance-era Florence, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1451\" href=\"/italy/3035-1451/\" slug=\"italy\">             Italy</a>. In a striking and somewhat peculiar move, you start off your Ezio experience with one of the biggest events for anyone: birth.

He was a total bad-ass, no doubt, but he often came off as callous, and for all the long-winded philosophical tap-dancing that went on, there was never any insight into the character. With Ezio, you watch as an incredibly justified vendetta drives him from brash bon vivant to brutal and unrepentant assassin, albeit one whose interests seem to line up with the greater good. Ezio's a colorful character, but much of the game's vibrance comes from the cities it takes place in, most notably Florence and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1825\" href=\"/venice-italy/3035-1825/\" slug=\"venice-italy\">            Venice</a>, both of which have such incredibly distinctive feels. The game definitely looks better when it's rendering the cramped city life than the sprawling countryside in between, though there are now numerous fast-travel points that make it easier to skip the flyover areas. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Not content creating lively, convincing renditions of real places, Assassin's Creed II weaves itself freely into the tumultuous history of Renaissance Italy, linking Ezio's path and the secret war between the Templars and the assassins with real historical figures like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10830\" href=\"/lorenzo-de-medici/3005-10830/\" slug=\"lorenzo-de-medici\">           Lorenzo de'Medici</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9703\" href=\"/dante-alighieri/3005-9703/\" slug=\"dante-alighieri\">          Dante Alighieri</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10829\" href=\"/niccolo-machiavelli/3005-10829/\" slug=\"niccolo-machiavelli\">         Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3202\" href=\"/leonardo-da-vinci/3005-3202/\" slug=\"leonardo-da-vinci\">        Leonard da Vinci</a>, along with numerous, lesser figures. It's a move that doesn't necessarily make the game's fantastical events somehow more plausible, but it's done well enough to bring some verisimilitude to the setting in general. <br/>\u00a0<br/>That the events of Ezio's life are basically just a crash-course training session for Desmond make it hard to get  <i>too</i> invested in Ezio's fate. You won't spend much time at all outside of the Animus in Assassin's Creed II, but the game still finds some fun ways to play around with the whole metafictional premise, an angle that's responsible for two of the game's most striking moments. Storywise, Assassin's Creed II has all the connective tissue of the second act in a trilogy, building on the original while creating more questions than it answers, and setting things up for what should be an interesting part three. <br/>\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1043662-956856_20090525_screen006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043662\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.559375\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1043662-956856_20090525_screen006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043662\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1043662-956856_20090525_screen006.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1043662-956856_20090525_screen006.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0 Altair is a figure of reverence, but Ezio could mop the floor with him.\u00a0  </figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">Despite the distinctions that the characters and locales provide, the biggest differentiator between Assassin's Creed and Assassin's Creed II is that there's just so much more stuff to do here. Nearly all of the discreet systems from the first game have been evolved and elaborated on in some meaningful fashion. This starts with Ezio himself, who benefits from the resources that his social station provide, though he's also generally just a superior specimen. Ezio's more agile than Altair, able to scale buildings more rapidly and gracefully. He's better in a straight-up fight, where the timing's been relaxed a bit and you're given the additional ability to disarm your foes, making their weapons your own. Ezio's dual wrist-mounted blades give him more--and more unflinchingly brutal--assassination opportunities. <br/>\u00a0<br/>He's more capable at disappearing into a crowd, able to blend in with any groups of pedestrians wandering the streets, toss out handfuls of coins to create a commotion and distract guards, or simply hire a group of comely courtesans to provide mobile cover. While Ezio has more means by which to dodge security, guards now have more memory of your action. Too much high-profile wetworking will leave you with a notoriety level that makes it harder to get around, though you can then reduce your notoriety level by tearing down wanted signs, bribing heralds, and murdering corrupt city officials. Then there's entirely new elements, like an economic system where the monetary investments you make into the small, dilapidated town surrounding your family villa, will pay out dividends that you can spend on new weapons, armor, color schemes for your outfit, and more. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Ezio's quest for revenge leads him on a series of thinly-disguised tutorials, various configurations of assassination assignments, and some crazy, one-of-a-kind set pieces. Though a certain murder-fatigue can set in after a while, the game does its best to stave it off with regular changes of scenery and plenty of extracurricular activities. There are thankfully no flags to be collected, though there are still race, courier, and assassination side missions to take on. You'll find labyrinthine tombs that require crackerjack timing and confident command of Ezio's full set of abilities to traverse. Monuments are laced with secret symbols that, when found and activated, mete out pieces of a puzzle left behind by a less fortunate Animus subject. You'll randomly happen upon pickpockets and enemy couriers that can be hunted down for profit. Most of the time, you don't have to seek out diversion; it's much more likely that you'll just naturally get sidetracked on your way to murder someone else. <br/>\u00a0<br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8169/1179886-956856_20091021_790screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1179886\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8169/1179886-956856_20091021_790screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1179886\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8169/1179886-956856_20091021_790screen002.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8169/1179886-956856_20091021_790screen002.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Tag, you're it!</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">This isn't to say there aren't some grievances to be leveled against Assassin's Creed II. Like the original, there's too much recycled voice work in the world at large, and if I never again hear the Italian-tinged voice that cries out \u201cmoney, money, money!\u201d when you toss some coins on the street, it'll be too soon. The semi-auto nature of the way Assassin's Creed's traversal systems work is a big part of what makes it feel so slick, but it can also backfire on you. Considering Ezio's high-wire lifestyle, it's usually pretty frustrating and calamitous when a your intended direction isn't interpreted the way you might hope. Lastly, this is, generally speaking, a pretty stunning-looking game, from the scale and detail of the world to Ezio's subtle, deadly movements, which makes it that much more surprising that all of the facial animation is as awkward as it is. <br/>\u00a0<br/>I came into Assassin's Creed II with a certain qualified affection for the original, and was thoroughly pleased with the lessons the developers learned between the two. But this isn't a reinvention, it's a refinement. Assassin's Creed II offers, fundamentally, the same kinds of thrills as its predecessor--leaping from rooftop to rooftop with surefooted ease, appearing out of nowhere to kill your target with a quick blade, then vanishing effortlessly into a crowd. It's just been expanded, streamlined, and overhauled in ways that bring it closer to grace and make it a much easier game to recommend. <br/></p><i>Disclosure: The game featured in this review is or was an advertised product on giantbomb.com.</i>", "deck": "Assassin's Creed II elaborates on the good ideas of its sneak-and-stab forebear, making an experience that requires far fewer excuses to enjoy.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-234/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22928/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/assassins-creed-ii/3030-22928/", "id": 22928, "name": "Assassin's Creed II"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-11-17 09:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84193/", "id": 84193, "name": "Assassin's Creed II"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/buzz-quiz-world-review/1900-235/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1180548-bqw_cologne_screenshot_fastest_finger_eng.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1180548\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.57027348394768\" data-width=\"4205\" style=\"width: 4205px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1180548-bqw_cologne_screenshot_fastest_finger_eng.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1180548\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1180548-bqw_cologne_screenshot_fastest_finger_eng.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The colored buttons on the controller match up to the on-screen presentation.\u00a0</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-29063\" href=\"/buzz-quiz-world/3030-29063/\" slug=\"buzz-quiz-world\">Buzz! Quiz World</a> continues the long-running Buzz! line by offering a decidedly game show-influenced take on trivia. The game disc claims to have 5,000 questions on it, covering a variety of topics. But Quiz World suffers a bit from some oddly regionalized question selection and, after a few rounds, you'll probably just want all the game show trappings to get out of your way so you can quickly move on to more questions.<br/> <br/> Like the other games in the Buzz! series, Quiz World requires the use of specific buzzer controllers. These \"Buzz! Buzzers\" are sold with the game, but you can also just get the game by itself, in case you already have a set from the previous PS3 Buzz! game. The controllers are well-made, but feel really superfluous. They have four buttons on them, which you use to select your answers. There's also a large buzzer-style button at the top, but you never use it to actually buzz in to answer a question. All of the different round types I encountered allow every player to answer, instead putting a priority on being the first to answer, rather than being the first to buzz in for an opportunity to answer. With the game only really requiring four buttons, there's no reason that support for standard PlayStation 3 controllers couldn't have been included. But as soon as you get the game started up, you can't even use your Dual Shock 3 to navigate the game's menus.<br/> <br/> Those menus give you a variety of ways to play Buzz!, ranging from a standard six-round game to a full 45 minutes of trivia. The rounds you play all have slightly different rules, with some that reveal the answer one letter at a time, or others that let you throw a pie at other players if you're the first to answer correctly. But they're all just different ways to serve you up trivia in a collection of different categories, and I found the more direct \"we're going to ask you a question, then you answer it\" rounds to be far more satisfying. 5,000 questions sounds like a lot, but if you're the type to choose your favorite categories (like '80s TV) every time they come up, you'll probably start to see a bit of repetition within the first few games. Also, some questions use photos or other bits of media to facilitate a question. Some of those bits--like a photo of singer Nelly Furtado--are used for multiple questions. The game has support for additional question packs, which can be purchased via the PlayStation Network, which should help expand the library once you start to notice a lot of repetition. If you've already purchased packs for the previous PS3 Buzz!, those plug right into Quiz World, too.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1180549-bqw_cologne_screenshot_piefight_intro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1180549\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.57027348394768\" data-width=\"4205\" style=\"width: 4205px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1180549-bqw_cologne_screenshot_piefight_intro.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1180549\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1180549-bqw_cologne_screenshot_piefight_intro.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Buzz's human eyes and Muppety look are kind of haunting.</figcaption></figure>While the questions are well-rounded and the game comes at you with a good variety of categories, there's a certain regionality to the questions that you don't get from most trivia games. The Buzz! series originates in the UK, and it's easy to see that fact in the way some questions are written. One question, for example, asks you to name which of a listing of four supermodels is from Croydon. Maybe I'm underestimating the North American casual gaming audience that would eat up a trivia game like Buzz!, but I was left thinking that most of the people who encounter that question won't know what Croydon even is. Another question focused on action/singer Jason Donovan, an Australian that I've never heard of before. I guess what I'm trying to say is expect some stuff that you have no hope of answering. Someone probably should have gone through the question list and tailored it a bit more for each specific region. For example, no one outside of the US should be forced to answer anything regarding Toby Keith. <i>Ever</i>.<br/> <br/> All of this trivia is couched in a game show format and hosted by a Muppety-looking guy named Buzz. Buzz comes across as an excitable British guy, and the show is very much tailored to look like the modern game shows that we stole from the UK, like <i>Who Wants To Be A Millionaire?</i> or <i>The Weakest Link</i>. As such, you'll see plenty of swooping jib shots and other flashy camera movement as the show plays out. Buzz chats you up between rounds, and in a clever move, the game comes with tons of prerecorded names, so when you create your profile, you can set it up so that Buzz calls you by name... provided you have one of the names listed, I suppose. The list certainly looks lengthy. While Buzz is a fine host, after three games of having him describe the rules to every round, I found myself looking for ways to shut him up and get on with the trivia. I never found a way to make that happen. Multiplayer games, which can contain up to eight players in an online setting, get especially bogged down by the way Buzz breaks down the scores between rounds.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1180560-bqw_e3_screenshot_prize_xray_specs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1180560\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.57723142704436\" data-width=\"1871\" style=\"width: 1871px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1180560-bqw_e3_screenshot_prize_xray_specs.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1180560\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1180560-bqw_e3_screenshot_prize_xray_specs.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1180560-bqw_e3_screenshot_prize_xray_specs.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The winner will \"earn\" a prize.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Quiz World also has support for Sony's MyBUZZ! site, which is a quiz-focused site where users can create their own sets of trivia questions. You can import your questions into the game, or search by subject and be randomly fed three rounds of user-written categories. There appear to be some decent user-written subjects out there, but most of what I was fed was poorly written and not much fun at all. But if you want to answer a whole bunch of trivia questions focused on games, the options is there. Just know that you'll probably be rating them down after you finish, especially with such dopey categories as \"UNCHARTED DRAES FORTUNE TROPHY\" and \"LIGHTNING KWIZ,\" where the answer is always \"LIGHTNING!\"<br/> <br/> If you've already got a set of Buzz! controllers, Quiz World goes down much easier at a $39.99 price tag, but $59.99 for a copy of the game and a set of four wireless controllers isn't bad, either. While the edges of the action can get a little rough, especially after repeated use, the core of the game offers a lot of solid trivia and a controller that anyone--even a person who has never played a video game before--can easily understand.

Attempting to make some sort of peripheral-based skateboarding game is a neat idea, and one that, if the peripheral were robust enough, could result in some sort of faux-skating experience that approximates the real thing in a way that's accessible to non-skaters without being completely offensive to anyone who's ever pulled an ollie. But everything about Tony Hawk: RIDE, from the game's structure to the skateboard hardware itself, is an absolute mess that feels incapable of pleasing anyone, regardless of his or her skill level.<br/> <br/> When your feet first touch the RIDE skateboard, it actually feels pretty good. It rocks back and forth a bit, and the curved nose and tail let you pop the front or back of the board into the air with ease. It also has four sensors, one on each side, which are primarily used when you want to tell the game that you're performing a grab move. It's sturdy, and feels solid under your feet without feeling stiff. Unfortunately, any goodwill built up by the look and feel of the board is thrown out the window as soon as you're finished calibrating it.<br/> <br/> The problem with the board is that it isn't great at translating your movements into the appropriate on-screen actions. For example, the two primary ways to pull tricks is to lift the nose of the board into the air, and then either tilt the board to one side or pivot the front of the board left or right. These are \"tilt\" and \"flick\" tricks, respectively. More often than not, performing flick motions resulted in tilt tricks. Getting through a challenge that requires a specific trick type feels like luck in a lot of cases. Also, the board feels like it loses its calibration over time, resulting in cases where popping the nose up into the air stops performing ollies. Other times, it's a case of sensitivity, with the board feeling like it's requiring different levels of pressure or height to trigger the tricks. With a peripheral like this, consistency is absolutely key to getting better at the game and learning from your mistakes. With hardware that's unable to provide that level of consistency from session to session, Tony Hawk: RIDE is already a total failure.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1165067-tn_565_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1165067\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.58407079646018\" data-width=\"565\" style=\"width: 565px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1165067-tn_565_18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1165067\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1165067-tn_565_18.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll visit a handful of different cities, including New York, Barcelona, and Tokyo.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>But it's hard to tell if it's the fault of the hardware or the software, because the game built around said board is a mess. Tony Hawk: RIDE places you into a series of fairly confined environments and, though it does still have a \"free skate\" option to let you explore, the main goals are things like races and score challenges. The racing feels like something out of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3631\" href=\"/tony-hawks-downhill-jam/3030-3631/\" slug=\"tony-hawks-downhill-jam\">Tony Hawk's Downhill Jam</a>, another misstep from the once-great franchise's past. The trick sections of the game are usually score-based, and most of the time it's easier to just flail around on the board to pull off random tricks than it is to carefully attempt specific motions.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>The other main street mode offers challenges, which are sections of the level where you're asked to perform specific motions on specific objects, like \"flick trick off of the ramp\" or \"5-0 grind this ledge.\" The more specific the tricks, the worse it gets. It also doesn't help that the game never really tells you how to perform specific tricks, so figuring out how to land in a 5-0 grind instead of a 50-50 feels like it's left to chance. In the event that you don't know enough about skateboarding to know what the heck a 5-0 grind is, you'll probably have to turn to a web browser and look up videos of said trick, then maybe you can figure out what the game might be asking you to do and attempt it from there. Also, the challenges require you to hit every trick in the challenge in one run. If you miss one, the challenge doesn't end and immediately restart. Instead, you'll keep skating until you hit the end of the challenge area and respawn. The lack of an instant restart--something that the Tony Hawk franchise has usually been pretty good about offering--makes this whole section of the game frustrating.<br/> <br/> There's also a vert mode, which is used when you're skating in half-pipes. For these levels, you'll rotate the board sideways and stand on it while facing the TV screen, but the basics don't change that much. If you're tilting when you leave the ramp, you'll probably spin. Or maybe your feet will accidentally trip one of the side sensors and you'll grab. Or maybe you'll reach down to deliberately perform a grab and nothing will happen. It's terrible.<br/> <br/> Tony Hawk: RIDE defaults to a mode called casual, where you only focus on performing tricks while the game steers for you. There are spots in the race and trick courses where you can select alternate paths, but for the most part, it's none of your concern. Riding along a set track and performing tricks might sound like the worst thing of all, but it's actually the most manageable way to play. Bumping from casual over to \"confident\" puts steering control in your power, which makes things much tougher. But considering the board can't even keep up with you on casual, asking it to keep track of your leaning to let you steer impedes the process even further.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1165059\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.62654867256637\" data-width=\"565\" style=\"width: 565px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1165059\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1165059-tn_565_8.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>When you find a gap, the game will transition to a different angle.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The game also has a party play mode, where groups of people can get together to discover just how unfun Tony Hawk: RIDE is in a variety of modes. You can also take the game online, where up to four players can have a bad time en masse. Or, at least, that's the theory. I tried on numerous occasions to find online opposition, but never found any takers.<br/> <br/> The only positive thing about Tony Hawk: RIDE is its soundtrack, which is lengthy and includes tracks from Murs, Santigold, Yeah Yeah Yeahs, Wolfmother, The Commodores, and more, including that \"Just Dropped In (To See What Condition My Condition Was In)\" song from\u00a0<i>The Big Lebowski</i>. Obviously that's not enough to make Tony Hawk: RIDE feel like it's worth anything close to its $120 price tag. While the Tony Hawk franchise has been down on its luck lately, and was probably in need of a reboot as dramatic as this, the execution is such a miserable failure that it manages to splash even more mud on Tony Hawk's legacy.

Zombies!</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">For all the popularity the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-397\" href=\"/resident-evil/3025-397/\" slug=\"resident-evil\">          Resident Evil</a> franchise has seen over the past decade, its unique, deliberately paced gameplay styles have always borne a relatively high barrier for entry, even as they've evolved over the years. The same cannot be said for the myriad of light-gun games set in the zombie-verse of Resident Evil, which go all the way back to the original <a data-ref-id=\"3045-22\" href=\"/playstation/3045-22/\" slug=\"playstation\"> PlayStation</a>, and which boil the Resident Evil experience down to shooting zombies in the face, over and over again. Ironically, it's not the difficulty or complexity of the gameplay that creates a barrier for <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25558\" href=\"/resident-evil-the-darkside-chronicles/3030-25558/\" slug=\"resident-evil-the-darkside-chronicles\">         Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles</a>. A simple weapon upgrade path aside, this is a game comfortable hitting the same basic point-and-shoot beats as something like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-508\" href=\"/the-house-of-the-dead/3030-508/\" slug=\"the-house-of-the-dead\">        The House of the Dead</a>. The barrier for Darkside Chronicles is the truncated way it presents the bone-dense Resident Evil mythology. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Darkside Chronicles primarily concerns itself with the events of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-9418\" href=\"/resident-evil-2/3030-9418/\" slug=\"resident-evil-2\">       Resident Evil 2</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13940\" href=\"/resident-evil-code-veronica/3030-13940/\" slug=\"resident-evil-code-veronica\">      Resident Evil: Code: Veronica</a>, though these familiar sections are bookended by a new mission set in South America that fills in some of the blanks leading up to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1578\" href=\"/resident-evil-4/3030-1578/\" slug=\"resident-evil-4\">     Resident Evil 4</a>. If you've played Resident Evil 2 and/or Resident Evil: Code: Veronica, you'll get to see some of the more action-packed set-pieces from those games from a guided, first-person perspective, and the new mission sheds some light on the relationship between <a data-ref-id=\"3005-649\" href=\"/leon-s-kennedy/3005-649/\" slug=\"leon-s-kennedy\">    Leon S. Kennedy</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3850\" href=\"/jack-krauser/3005-3850/\" slug=\"jack-krauser\">   Jack Krauser</a>, all of which I certainly see the appeal of. If you haven't already bought into Resident Evil, though, you're left with a  <i>Reader's Digest</i> version of those stories. The game flatly delivers most of the information to meet your immediate needs, but without the proper context, it's not terribly engaging. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Not that you really need that much backstory to know that zombies are bad, and need to be shot in the face. Repeatedly. Darkside Chronicles relies on a lot of shopworn light-gun game tricks, which creates a lot of slack in what is already a slow-moving game, and neutralizes the game's grimy atmosphere and any attempt at jump scares. If you see a zombie corpse on the ground, you can expect it to lumber to its feet at some point. You can expect that, if you see a conspicuously empty area, you'll find it swarming with the undead on a second glance. Individual chapters are often punctuated with boss encounters, which represent the only real challenge in Darkside Chronicles, due largely to the amount of damage they deal with each attack. <br/>\u00a0<br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1097656-dc7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1097656\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5911/1097656-dc7.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1097656\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5911/1097656-dc7.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0You'll face plenty of other familiar creepy-crawlies, too.</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">If there's something to set Darkside Chronicles apart, it's the way it aims for more naturalistic camera movement, which, when combined with the old VHS-tape motif of the game's menus, seems designed to evoke a  <i>Cloverfield</i>-style YOU ARE THERE atmosphere. The flaw in this line of thinking is that all that camera shake makes it harder to draw a bead on a target, something that seems to run counter to the premium the game puts on headshots. You've got a basic pistol that comes with infinite ammo, though you can also pick up weapons like shotguns, submachine guns, grenades, and others which pack a bit more punch. This is where Darkside Chronicles offers up a hint of depth, as you can take currency earned during missions to upgrade various aspects of your arsenal. <br/>\u00a0<br/>If you don't come into Resident Evil: The Darkside Chronicles with an innate appreciation for the fiction of Resident Evil, all it really has to offer is a pretty by-the-numbers guided shooter experience. This doesn't make it a bad game, just an unambitious one, and one that has a hard limit on the audience for whom it will hold any significant appeal.<br/></p>", "deck": "Darkside Chronicles is a fine fit for those enamored with the fiction of the Resident Evil series.

From that first game to this next one, sullen anti-hero <a data-ref-id=\"3005-645\" href=\"/kratos/3005-645/\" slug=\"kratos\">Kratos</a> has always busted out the exact same chain-whip combo when you hit square-square-triangle; he's always ripped hapless enemies in half right at the waist. The magical attacks and mythological foes might become more outlandish over time, but playing this package reminds you how remarkably consistent God of War's basic rhythms have remained over time.<br/> <br/> That's probably just how fans want it--and it's probably why the series' first two games, landmark releases on the PlayStation 2 in their day, are still so playable now. There's something to be said for devising a winning formula and sticking with it, after all. The games do start out sort of button-mashy, but they allow room for technique in the action before they eventually start to require it. The carrot-on-a-stick drive of amassing red orbs to exchange for deadlier powers is still a good motivation to plow through these games, as are the epically cinematic (though largely scripted) boss encounters. Remember impaling that gigantic hydra's head onto the broken ship's mast at the beginning of the first game? That fight hasn't lost as much of its original wow factor as you might think.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/1194942-gow_collection_gow1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1194942\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/1194942-gow_collection_gow1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1194942\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/1194942-gow_collection_gow1.png\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The first one ain't no slouch either.</figcaption></figure>God of War Collection lets you visit or revisit these first two installments in what's now one of Sony's tentpole franchises, giving you a chance to bone up on where Kratos has been and where he's going prior to the launch of that next big God of War game (the first on the PlayStation 3) next March. From his quest to redeem his sordid, violent past in the original game to the travails of newfound godhood he grapples with in the second, Kratos' tale is one still worth absorbing, and although I can't say with certainty that you'll need to know the whole story to appreciate next year's sequel, it sure won't hurt if you do.<br/> <br/> God of War's narrative elements may be timeless, but its visuals, however recent, are not. At least not in their original form, which Sony has dramatically gussied up by increasing the resolution to a sharp 1080p and locking the performance in at a buttery smooth 60 frames per second. At nearly five years old, the first game looks surprisingly good with these improvements, but it's the second one that really stands out. Granted, God of War II came out after the PS3 did, but at times while playing it in this collection you could start to forget it was actually designed for a generation-old piece of hardware in the first place. That visual excellence probably owes in large part to strong art design, but the technical polish on this package makes a huge difference in keeping it current too.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/1194943-gow_collection_menus.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1194943\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56440281030445\" data-width=\"1281\" style=\"width: 1281px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/31/1194943-gow_collection_menus.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1194943\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/1194943-gow_collection_menus.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/31/1194943-gow_collection_menus.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Niiiiiiice and simple.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>For $40, it's probably beyond the scope of this disc to expect any new special features, nor a PS3-compatible version of last year's PSP installment, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20592\" href=\"/god-of-war-chains-of-olympus/3030-20592/\" slug=\"god-of-war-chains-of-olympus\">Chains of Olympus</a>. (Sony would probably still like you to buy that one <i>on</i> the PSP.) At least you do get the original behind-the-scenes bonus videos that shipped with the two original games, in which you get to see a younger, goateed <a data-ref-id=\"3040-44184\" href=\"/david-jaffe/3040-44184/\" slug=\"david-jaffe\">David Jaffe</a> talking shop, and <a data-ref-id=\"3040-63532\" href=\"/cory-barlog/3040-63532/\" slug=\"cory-barlog\">Cory Barlog</a> making a sandwich in his kitchen. And Sony has integrated a raft of easy trophies into both games, just about all of which you could earn on your first time through each one. These are broken out into two separate entries on your PSN profile, so this disc is recommendable to anyone looking to earn a couple of easy Platinum trophies.<br/> <br/> It's also essential for diehard God of War purists who want to own the best possible versions of these games for posterity. For someone who already has the original releases and a backwards-compatible PlayStation 3, on the other hand, God of War Collection is a harder sell. But it's ultimately <i>most</i> valuable to people who didn't play much or any of the originals, for whom this package serves as both a fine refresher course and also a couple of kick-ass action games, available on the cheap. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "Thanks to the high-res treatment and bloodily timeless gameplay, these PS2 action classics hold up better than you might think.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-238/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-28001/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/god-of-war-collection/3030-28001/", "id": 28001, "name": "God of War Collection"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-11-20 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-87008/", "id": 87008, "name": "God of War Collection"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/borderlands-review/1900-239/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1198260-houseonhill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1198260\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"5120\" style=\"width: 5120px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1198260-houseonhill.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1198260\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1198260-houseonhill.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The island has the atmosphere of an amusement park ride. Spooky, but in a kind of fun way.</figcaption></figure>Though <a data-ref-id=\"3015-79\" href=\"/zombie/3015-79/\" slug=\"zombie\">zombies</a> are dangerously close to becoming \"the new <a data-ref-id=\"3015-471\" href=\"/world-war-ii/3015-471/\" slug=\"world-war-ii\">World War II</a>\" when it comes to saturated game concepts, there's something sort of refreshing about the way The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned fits into <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\" href=\"/gearbox-software-llc/3010-1615/\" slug=\"gearbox-software-llc\">Gearbox</a>'s shoot-n-loot, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\" href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/\" slug=\"borderlands\">Borderlands</a>. That's probably because the zombie-related content doesn't completely overrun the game. Rather, it feels like some sort of crazy \"what if\" scenario that takes a world you've already experienced and spins it in a new way. It's not very long, and it doesn't increase the level cap or offer new items, but Zombie Island is a good new environment with some decent quests and a final boss fight that's actually a little tougher than the one you'll see in the main story.<br/> <br/> The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is presented as if Marcus Kincaid--the guy who runs the weapons vending machines--is telling a bedtime story to a child. The story he's telling makes it sound like Zombie Island is set after the events of Borderlands, but you can actually fast travel to the island at any time with any character that's level 10 or higher. To account for that 40-level range of characters with access to the island, the enemies there scale to fit your level every time you visit, ensuring that dealing with the zombie menace won't feel like a complete afterthought. Also, players who haven't yet hit level 50 will get the extra added bonus of actually gaining meaningful experience while on the island. Though I enjoyed taking my level 50 soldier through the island's quests, it still felt a little hollow, since I wasn't really building onto my character in meaningful ways. Don't expect a rush of new zombie-themed items, either. Though I did manage to find a couple of shields that were better than the one I came in with, the loot is the same sort of stuff you'll find in the main game. That said, seeing a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">rocket launcher</a> pop out of a zombified torso is pretty funny.<br/> <br/> That's actually where Zombie Island puts in the most work: on laughs. The only non-monster (though that's debatable) you'll see on Zombie Island is Dr. Ned himself. Dr. Ned is the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13149\" href=\"/dr-zed/3005-13149/\" slug=\"dr-zed\">Dr. Zed</a> model from the Fyrestone section of the main game, but with a big, fake-looking mustache. Over his surgical mask. He's quick to point out on several occasions that he is most certainly not the same character as Dr. Zed. And you'll also find some funny little bits in the quest text, like one spot where Ned realizes that maybe he should have been a villain instead of just an NPC.<br/> <br/> Most of the landscape in Zombie Island is fresh and doesn't look like anything you've seen in the main game. The main area is full of dead trees and has a huge moon that's often used as a backdrop for buildings. It gives the whole thing a spooky, haunted house kind of vibe while still coming across as lighthearted. These zombies are coming to eat your brains, sure, but when you shoot them in the head, their brains pop out, letting you collect them for a rather annoying series of quests. Of course, there's an exception to all this. One of the zones, Dead Haven, is just a reskinned version of the Old Haven zone from the main game, with a few walls thrown up to force you to take a different path through the zone. It's unfortunate to see content get reused like this in a pack that isn't all that long to begin with, but the dire-looking sky and alternate path through the area manages to change things up just enough to feel acceptable.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1198264-screenshot00023.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1198264\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.6171875\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:61.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1198264-screenshot00023.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1198264\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1198264-screenshot00023.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You're going to want to shoot that guy in the head. Or burn him. Preferably both.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Of course, the whole time you're moving through these areas, you'll be attacked by various zombies. The zombies typically move really slowly, but if they get up close, they dish out some serious damage. Also, if you go down while surrounded by zombies, further hits actually make your bleed out timer drain more quickly. This makes a mass of zombies a bit tougher to deal with than a mass of, say, spider ants. Also, zombies frequently spawn behind you, so you'll be surrounded a lot. In addition to the regular zombies, there are also defilers, which puke onto you when they close in, slowing your movement. You'll also occasionally see some lance zombies, which can throw down a turret. The most evil non-boss zombie is probably the suicide zombie, which first tries to throw an exploding barrel at you, then rushes you, exploding upon death. Overall, the combat feels a bit different than anything you've fought in other parts of Borderlands, but it's nothing that a little situational awareness and a lot of circle-strafing can't handle.<br/> <br/> The Zombie Island of Dr. Ned is a solid addition for anyone who wants more Borderlands, but the lack of additional items or further opportunities for character building feel like a missed opportunity that could have given this content a lasting effect. Without any of that, you're really just paying $10 to tack an additional few hours of content onto an already-long game. As someone who played the heck out of Borderlands and desperately wants more, that's totally fine with me.

Specifically, it's the content of that dialogue that stands out. Rogue Warrior might be the filthiest, most curse-filled game to ever make its way onto console. When you step into the shoes of real-life Navy SEAL \"Demo\" <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10492\" href=\"/dick-marcinko/3005-10492/\" slug=\"dick-marcinko\">Dick Marcinko</a>, you're stepping in a heaping pile of shit. <i>Shits</i>, really. And <i>fucks</i>. And <i>motherfuckers</i>. Almost every line of dialogue, from \"eat shit, fuckbag\" to \"happy fucking birthday\" to \"rock and roll, motherfuckers, rock and roll\" is peppered with the type of language you wouldn't want your mother to hear. Half the time, the lines barely make sense when set against the action. That will certainly be a turn-off to those of you with more sensitive ears. But even if you're accustomed to the rough stuff, the way it's used in Rogue Warrior is only good at making the game a bit more laughable than it would be otherwise. Without the over-the-top language, Rogue Warrior wouldn't have any discernible characteristics at all.<br/> <br/> On the story side of things, you play as Marcinko immediately after he's inserted into <a data-ref-id=\"3035-418\" href=\"/north-korea/3035-418/\" slug=\"north-korea\">North Korean</a> territory, where he's planning to investigate a missile-building operation. In true <a data-ref-id=\"3005-225\" href=\"/john-rambo/3005-225/\" slug=\"john-rambo\">Rambo</a>-like fashion, Dick doesn't stand down after figuring out what's going on. Rather than waiting for backup, you'll infiltrate <a data-ref-id=\"3035-38\" href=\"/russia/3035-38/\" slug=\"russia\">Russia</a>, blow up some more missiles, destroy a bunker or a palace or two, and then get out. Right about that time, the credits roll. It's a short and uneventful experience with a lone payoff in the end credits, which plays a song featuring stitched-together lines of dialogue. Sometimes it rhymes. You could watch that without playing the game and get just as much out of it as I did.<br/> <br/> The gameplay allows for a bit of stealth and even includes close-up melee kills, which are canned animations that play out when you get close to an enemy and hit the action button. These usually involve Marcinko burying his knife deep into the skulls or torsos of his foes, and they get repetitive quickly. Also, in multiple cases the icon for the kill move would appear, but hitting the appropriate button wouldn't actually trigger the animation. It all feels very sloppy.<br/> <br/> The shooting isn't much better. The movement feels stiff, and motions like looking down the sights of your gun feel sluggish, like it's taking more time than it should. Also, the guns take up large portions of the screen when you're aiming down the sights, which can make it hard to line up headshots. I ended up playing most of the game with the default pistol, which is silenced and has infinite ammunition.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/961932-ivan_throat_rev4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-961932\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/961932-ivan_throat_rev4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-961932\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/961932-ivan_throat_rev4.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Ow, my neck!\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The game also has a multiplayer mode, which offers both deathmatch and team deathmatch on a handful of maps. Though you can perform the knife-based kill animations in multiplayer, it only takes a few bullets to drop an enemy. Also, I ran into an issue with the 360 version where, after a match ended, it rolled the credits and gave me an an achievement for finishing a single-player level without dying. Since it played the amazing credit music again, I wasn't too bummed out about that. The multiplayer, like most of Rogue Warrior, is functional, but totally uninspired, with no hook to keep you coming back.<br/> <br/> Visually, the game sports some pretty awful effects. Though \"Demo\" Dick is supposed to be blowing things up left and right, the explosions look awfully pathetic. The animation is incredibly stiff and the enemy character models look really bad. Marcinko himself looks passable, compared to the rest of the game. Also, the frame rate is consistently low, with heavier dips during busy scenes or knife kill animations. It's an ugly-looking game from top to bottom.<br/> <br/> You have to wonder how something like this makes its way onto shelves as a full-priced product. Though there's some sort of ironic fun to be had by cruising through the short campaign and listening to Mickey Rourke shout obscenities, it's practically impossible to wring $60 of excitement out of this disc. If you're the ironic type that loves dumb games, you'll have a few laughs at Rogue Warrior's expense, but even compared to ironic favorites like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20454\" href=\"/50-cent-blood-on-the-sand/3030-20454/\" slug=\"50-cent-blood-on-the-sand\">50 Cent: Blood on the Sand</a>, Rogue Warrior comes up short.", "deck": "Rogue Warrior is probably the most foul-mouthed game of all time, but that's not enough to distract you from the poor shooting and sometimes-ugly visuals.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-240/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-22858/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/rogue-warrior/3030-22858/", "id": 22858, "name": "Rogue Warrior"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2009-12-03 11:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-88282/", "id": 88282, "name": "Rogue Warrior"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/the-legend-of-zelda-spirit-tracks-review/1900-241/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1205976-zelda03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1205976\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1205976-zelda03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1205976\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/112/1205976-zelda03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Link, meet Zelda.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Fact: Kids <i>love</i> <a data-ref-id=\"3055-650\" href=\"/train/3055-650/\" slug=\"train\">trains</a>. Fact: <a data-ref-id=\"3005-191\" href=\"/link/3005-191/\" slug=\"link\">Link</a> needs a way to get around. But don't take the rail-riding theme of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25657\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-spirit-tracks/3030-25657/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-spirit-tracks\">The Legend of Zelda: Spirit Tracks</a> to mean that this is some watered-down experience for the younger set. There are plenty of tricky puzzles in place that should satisfy (and occasionally frustrate) Zelda fans of any age. Weirdly enough, the parts of the game that drag are usually the ones that involve you directly controlling a train.<br/><br/>Spirit Tracks is designed as a follow-up to the last DS release for the Zelda series, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3666\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-phantom-hourglass/3030-3666/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-phantom-hourglass\">Phantom Hourglass</a>. You'll see a few returning motifs, and the art style is similarly evolved from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18508\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker/3030-18508/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker\">Wind Waker</a>, but it's not really a direct sequel, as it again resets to new, young versions of Link\u00a0and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-5\" href=\"/zelda/3005-5/\" slug=\"zelda\">Zelda</a>. The story has Link traveling the world as he attempts to stop the resurrection of Malladus, the demon king, but he won't do it alone. After the basic visit to the castle and requisite annoying stealth sequence, Zelda's body is stolen, and is to be used as a vessel for the returning antagonist. This leaves Zelda's spirit roaming free, in ghost form. So she tags along with Link for the duration of the game, popping out occasionally to provide some tips about what you're supposed to be doing.<br/><br/>Zelda also takes a more active role in some parts of the game. The basic flow of Spirit Tracks has you visiting the Tower of Spirits, a tall building in the center of the world, to get maps to the game's four quadrants. Once you've acquired the map, you can head out into one of the game's four realms, each with its own points of interest, including a temple. Those temples are very much done in the traditional Zelda style, with a new inventory item that you'll obviously use on that temple's boss. But the levels you'll take on in the tower have a very different feel to them, and focus much more on puzzle-solving than combat. In the tower, Zelda can possess Phantoms--which are large, ghostly sets of armor that roam the halls of the tower and effectively wipe you out in one hit, making careful play a requirement. Once in a suit of armor, you can directly control Zelda's ghost by tapping a circle at her feet and drawing a path for her to move along. The different suits she'll possess as you return to the tower every couple of hours give her slightly different abilities, which changes up how you'll forge ahead.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1205979-zelda06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1205979\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4375\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1205979-zelda06.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1205979\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/112/1205979-zelda06.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You'll need to restore the spirit tracks before you can ride on them.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>A series of train tracks connect all points in the world, and all of your overworld travel is done by train. It's not entirely unlike the boat travel in Phantom Hourglass, but being stuck to the tracks feels really confining. At times, it almost becomes a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7624\" href=\"/pac-man/3030-7624/\" slug=\"pac-man\">Pac-Man</a>-like maze game, where you're trying to take paths that avoid indestructible enemy trains. But most of all, the train travel is sort of boring. You'll spend a lot of time just getting from one point to the next, and aside from a cannon, which you can use to fend off the occasional enemy attack or idly shoot at boulders in the hopes of uncovering some <a data-ref-id=\"3055-44\" href=\"/rupee/3055-44/\" slug=\"rupee\">rupees</a>, there isn't much to do. The rest of the game keeps up a pretty peppy pace, so chugging around the map really breaks up the flow of the game.<br/><br/>Though you can use the DS face buttons and triggers as handy shortcuts for some functions, Spirit Tracks is primarily played with the stylus. You'll tap enemies to attack, hold the stylus on the screen to move in different directions, and make helpful notes on maps. You'll also draw flight paths for <a data-ref-id=\"3055-76\" href=\"/boomerang/3055-76/\" slug=\"boomerang\">boomerangs</a>, and swipe or swirl on the screen to perform different sword moves. For the most part, the stylus control is great, and gives the entire game a sort of laid-back, simple feel. But in the few cases where the game starts demanding precision, all of that stylus control becomes something of a liability. Things like a boss fight where you have to quickly use the boomerang to bring fire to an icy enemy, or having to deflect incoming projectiles with well-timed sword swings were more frustrating than fun, because it's easy to see exactly what you need to do, it's just not always as easy to do it. Not to totally discount the nature of stylus controls, but if you could swing the sword by pushing a button and move yourself around with some sort of \"directional pad,\" this wouldn't be an issue at all. Thankfully, most of the game is pretty forgiving with this sort of thing.<br/><br/>There are a lot of little side things to do in Spirit Tracks, like the occasional passenger who wants to get from one place to another, or the rabbit rescue guy, who gives you cash and bonuses for finding and delivering any wild rabbits you find while chugging around the world. You can even upgrade your train with sturdier cars, which is sort of handy during one late-game sequence. But I never ran into any situation that would have been much easier with a few extra heart containers, and only really died when I got extremely careless. Most of the challenge in Spirit Tracks comes from staring at maps and figuring out what, exactly, needs to be done to get from point A to point B.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1205982-zelda09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1205982\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.4375\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:143.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1205982-zelda09.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1205982\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/112/1205982-zelda09.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/112/1205982-zelda09.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Blow into the DS mic and you can play this sick pan flute.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>In addition to its lengthy single-player adventure, there's a multiplayer component to Spirit Tracks. The battle mode lets up to four local players (using only one copy of the game) run around small areas to collect force gems. Pit traps and roaming phantoms abound, and getting hit causes you to drop some of your gems. The player with the most gems when time expires wins. With no sword to swing, this barely feels like something connected to the Zelda universe, and it's a pretty dull experience, overall. The game also has tag mode, which lets you trade treasures with other nearby Spirit Tracks players while your DS is in sleep mode. The treasures are used to purchase train upgrades, so hunting down specific treasures is a key part of that process. Maybe your reality is different than mine, but I bet I could carry my DSi on me, in tag mode, for a full month and <i>never</i> encounter another player doing the same.<br/><br/>The audio is what you'd expect, with remixed takes on the franchise's anthemic soundtrack and plenty of yelps and shouts (but no speech) from Link. Visually, the game looks very similar to Phantom Hourglass, keeping to the Wind Waker style that served the previous game so well. Though Link is understandably silent, his eyes and mouth are able to convey a good range of emotions, from fear to joy to gritted determination. Artistically, the game looks fantastic. On the technical side, though, the game noticeably slows down when you're attacked while on your train. It makes an already slow process feel even slower.<br/><br/>Though parts of Spirit Tracks are a little disappointing, most of those low points are offset by its terrific puzzle design and a great, fun story that feels noticeably different from the standard \"save the princess\" saga that series fans are used to seeing. Plus you can blow the train whistle, at will, whenever you're on-board.

Both find unique settings and situations for the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-207\" href=\"/open-world/3015-207/\" slug=\"open-world\">        open-world</a> format. Both find fascination with blowing things up on a grand scale. And both are brimming with potentially fun ideas that aren't as thought through as they should be. To be clear, The Saboteur isn't as straight-up busted as Mercs 2 was, but it still feels overextended. <br/>  \u00a0<br/>  Though set in <a data-ref-id=\"3015-471\" href=\"/world-war-ii/3015-471/\" slug=\"world-war-ii\">          World War II</a>--more specifically, the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-113\" href=\"/nazis/3015-113/\" slug=\"nazis\">          Nazi</a> occupation of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-487\" href=\"/paris/3035-487/\" slug=\"paris\">          Paris</a>--The Saboteur is notable for, if nothing else, foregoing the reverent tone most <a data-ref-id=\"3025-520\" href=\"/medal-of-honor/3025-520/\" slug=\"medal-of-honor\"> </a>WWII games assume. This isn't  <i>Saving Private Ryan</i>; this is more like  <i>The Great Escape</i> by way of  <i>Inglorious Basterds</i>. This is a two-fisted tale of revenge about an Irish mechanic-turned-race-car-driver named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6127\" href=\"/sean-devlin/3005-6127/\" slug=\"sean-devlin\">          Sean Devlin</a> whose vendetta against a diabolical Nazi officer--the same man that both cheated him out of his first race victory and murdered his best friend right before his eyes--puts him in league with the Parisian underworld, comely cabaret girls, and the French Resistance. It's got an odd tone to it, and the game sometimes has a hard time juggling the tough-talkin' Devlin's personal angst, his multiple <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1898\" href=\"/femme-fatale/3015-1898/\" slug=\"femme-fatale\">          femme fatale</a> love interests, his role within the Resistance, and all of the war-time business that actually propels the story forward. The story doesn't pack as much of a punch as it could have, but it sets an appropriate mood for the improbable craziness Sean gets up to. <br/> <p style=\"\">\u00a0<br/>  The big visual trick in The Saboteur is that Nazi-occupied Paris starts off mostly in black-and-white, save for some splashes of color to help identify Resistance and Nazi stuff. It's a striking, <i>Sin City</i>  sort of look, though the lack of color cues can make the world a little hard to negotiate. As you liberate portions of the city, not only do the Parisians themselves become more sympathetic to your cause, but color comes back to that piece of the world. Again, not a bad little trick, and the world of video games is built on borrowing clever little tricks like that from other games, but it would've carried more weight if <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20555\" href=\"/okami/3030-20555/\" slug=\"okami\">          Okami</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20961\" href=\"/prince-of-persia/3030-20961/\" slug=\"prince-of-persia\">                      Prince of Persia</a> hadn't already put it to good use. \u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1186353-2009_11_06_030022_1920x1080_scrot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186353\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55399061032864\" data-width=\"639\" style=\"width: 639px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1186353-2009_11_06_030022_1920x1080_scrot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186353\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39552/1186353-2009_11_06_030022_1920x1080_scrot.png\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0 Bringing color to Paris, one explosion at a time. </figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">Some might take issue with the voice work in The Saboteur, which trades almost exclusively in thickly caricatured European accents. Though voiced by an actual Irishman, Sean Devlin's Irish accent has a syrupy lilt to it that, in concert with his stereotypically short temper, affection for Scotch, and regular use of colloquialisms like \u201cshite,\u201d \u201carse,\u201d and, I shite you not, \u201ctop o' the mornin' to ye,\u201d can make the character feel a little  <i>Lucky Charms</i> at times. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2835\" href=\"/english-accent/3015-2835/\" slug=\"english-accent\">                     English</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2843\" href=\"/french-accent/3015-2843/\" slug=\"french-accent\">          French</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2922\" href=\"/german-accent/3015-2922/\" slug=\"german-accent\">          German</a> characters receive similar treatment. While there's no American character in the game, if there were, he'd wear a 10-gallon hat and be called \u201cTex.\u201d This might be distracting if The Saboteur took itself too seriously, an issue it mostly avoids. The music, on the other hand, requires no such apologies, and The Saboteur gets a lot of mileage out of its main musical theme filtered through various era-appropriate genres. I particularly found its use at the end of the game to be haunting, an adjective I don't throw around too often when it comes to games. <br/></p><p style=\"\">  \u00a0<br/>  That oddly quiet end sequence, though, is squarely at odds with the not-quite-there quality that permeates the rest of the game. This is an open-world game that gives you very little to do beyond take on missions and blow up Nazi installations, of which there are hundreds scattered across Paris. The missions themselves follow some pretty sturdy open-world formulas of \"go here, blow up a thing/kill a guy/steal a thing, get away.\"\u00a0 <br/>  \u00a0<br/>  The trick is that you can opt to go about each of these missions in a few different ways. As Le titular Saboteur, Devlin's got four primary disciplines, and most missions are structured in such a way that I found myself regularly using some combination of all of them. He's handy with the hardware, including the firearms he adds to his personal arsenal via a network of black market traders, and that he picks up off the bodies of dead Nazis. Regardless of how you choose to play The Saboteur, you're going to end up in a fair amount of firefights, and the shooting has a nice impact to it.

Despite some fussiness with where exactly you can place explosives, it's admittedly pretty satisfying to walk up to a Nazi <a data-ref-id=\"3055-92\" href=\"/tank/3055-92/\" slug=\"tank\">          tank</a>, casually stick a bundle of TNT to the side, and walk away all nonchalant as it blows up behind you. <br/>  \u00a0<br/>  Most of the time you can walk around Paris a free man, but if you're too close to an explosion, or a Nazi sees you doing something suspicious, the jackboots will start coming for you in a hurry. Lucky for you, Devlin can be a sneaky Irishman, and there's a lot of very loose, very optional <a data-ref-id=\"3015-24\" href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" slug=\"stealth\">        stealth</a> gameplay to be had here. If you manage to take down a Nazi with your bare hands, and without any other Nazis seeing you, you can steal his uniform, making it easier to approach Nazi bases, personnel, and equipment. There's a whole system of gauges and meters and alarm levels and zones and geegaws and jimjams associated with the stealth that makes it feel extremely gamey. I spent a lot of my time during the stealth sequences staring at circles within circles within circles on my <a data-ref-id=\"3015-185\" href=\"/minimap/3015-185/\" slug=\"minimap\">           minimap</a>. It's a fairly baroque solution, but it mostly works. <br/>  \u00a0<br/>  Alternately, if dress-up's not your thing, you can bypass some security by scaling the sheer faces of buildings and running along rooftops. It doesn't help that The Saboteur is coming out a few weeks after <a data-ref-id=\"3030-22928\" href=\"/assassins-creed-ii/3030-22928/\" slug=\"assassins-creed-ii\">        Assassin's Creed II</a>, which handles urban traversal with preternatural elegance. Even without those comparisons, The Saboteur would still feel a little unreliable. The character movement in general feels twitchy, but trying to negotiate the uneven roof ledges of Paris is particularly nerve-wracking. In all my time with The Saboteur, I never felt totally confident when I approached a ladder. <br/>  \u00a0<br/> </p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1186350-2009_11_06_025939_1920x1080_scrot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186350\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.55886970172684\" data-width=\"637\" style=\"width: 637px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:55.9%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/39552/1186350-2009_11_06_025939_1920x1080_scrot.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1186350\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39552/1186350-2009_11_06_025939_1920x1080_scrot.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/39552/1186350-2009_11_06_025939_1920x1080_scrot.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Kind of hard to argue with shooting zeppelins out of the air.</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">The gunplay, the sabotage, the stealth, and the proto-parkour are all fun, if not original, ideas, and they're accompanied by additional ideas like the ability to call in Resistance supporters or a getaway car in a firefight, or the ability to turn any car into a rolling bomb, but the ideas never feel like they come together as a cohesive whole. Whenever a new gameplay concept is introduced, it's not streamlined into a mission. Instead, the game comes to a full stop and treats you to several pages of text explaining how the new stuff works. The other sterling example is the way that, when your Nazi disguise has been discovered, it jarringly  <i>disappears</i> off Sean's body. That ruins any sense of reality the game might try and establish. <br/>  \u00a0<br/>  There are also nuts and bolts issues with the tech behind The Saboteur. The frame rate, while mostly inoffensive, bogged down <i>dramatically</i>  at one particularly action-packed sequence. The level of detail can be distracting, especially when the bright lights of the Eiffel Tower blink out abruptly at a certain distance. Enemy, pedestrian, and driver AI aren't particularly brilliant, and it's not uncommon to see another driver (or as Sean might say,  <i>droivur</i>) trying to negotiate some baffling 16-point turn. At a certain point in my progression, I found that every time I passed a certain tank, it appeared as though it had dropped from about four feet in the air, and was rubbing uncomfortably against a nearby tree. There are a lot of nitpicky little things to snag yourself on in The Saboteur, but they add up. <br/>  \u00a0<br/>  About the greatest success an open-world game can achieve is to dupe the player into believing, even on a sub-conscious level, that they are in a real place. Deep down, we know that these are all clockwork playgrounds constructed specifically for our amusement, so it's not an easy thing to do. But The Saboteur's gameplay systems never let you forget that you are playing a game, and the nakedness of the underlying machinery is one of the game's greatest shortcomings.<br/> </p>", "deck": "Pandemic brings some pulpy flavor to this open-world WWII game, but its stylish charm doesn't quite overcome the rough edges or the sense that its best tricks are borrowed from other, better games.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-242/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, PC", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21616/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/the-saboteur/3030-21616/", "id": 21616, "name": "The Saboteur"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2009-12-08 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-83363/", "id": 83363, "name": "The Saboteur"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/james-camerons-avatar-the-game-review/1900-243/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67955/1196407-avatar18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1196407\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67955/1196407-avatar18.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1196407\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67955/1196407-avatar18.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The mystical Na'vi aren't a ton of fun to play...</figcaption></figure>I learned more about <a data-ref-id=\"3040-3594\" href=\"/james-cameron/3040-3594/\" slug=\"james-cameron\">James Cameron</a>'s forthcoming sci-fi epic <i>Avatar</i> from watching the film's <a href=\"http://www.apple.com/trailers/fox/avatar/\" rel=\"nofollow\">three-minute trailer</a> than I did in a dozen hours of playing its mediocre tie-in action game. Effectively conveying Cameron's new, elaborate fiction isn't the only thing <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26589\" href=\"/james-camerons-avatar-the-game/3030-26589/\" slug=\"james-camerons-avatar-the-game\">Avatar: The Game</a> does poorly; it also fails to provide smooth performance, a rich variety of alien backdrops to explore, or third-person shooting action equal to even the average entries in the genre. The game's core framework isn't aggressively bad, with a thoughtfully designed element here or there that feels like it belongs in a better game, but every aspect of the execution is lousy enough that the cumulative experience is not a good one.<br/> <br/> Like the new movie, Avatar: The Game splits the action between the materialistic, militaristic future humans trying to pillage the copious resources of the fantastic moon Pandora, and the mystical indigenous blue Na'vi desperately defending their homeland. Two years before the movie takes place, you're a human agent who also happens to be genetically compatible with an \"avatar,\" a lab-grown human/Na'vi hybrid that the DNA donor can then control remotely from the comfort of a pod that looks like a tanning bed. The avatars seem best suited to diplomatic relations with the natives, but they also work in a pinch when you decide to relinquish your humanity and join up with those natives to fight the encroaching corporate interests. (Again, I learned most of this from watching that trailer, since the game thrusts you straight into bland jungle shooting with little preamble.)<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67955/1196401-avatar12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1196401\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/67955/1196401-avatar12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1196401\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/67955/1196401-avatar12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0...but the humans and their guns are no better.</figcaption></figure>Avatar does a half-hearted, uninteresting job of introducing you to all this business, and after giving you a hackneyed choice in the first area between sticking with the humans or going rogue with the Na'vi, it offers an equally flat campaign across a handful of hours filled with awkward, repetitive action. The humans naturally trade in high-tech guns and vehicles, while the Na'vi focus on earthy melee attacks and mystical means of defense, but neither one is much fun to play for a list of reasons too long to enumerate. Things like clumsy character movement, awful driving controls, tiresome mission objectives, and a horribly inconsistent frame rate are all anathema to a third-person action game, but they all exist in <i>this</i> third-person action game. At one point I fought a major boss whose attack behavior never triggered, so he stood motionless as I emptied clip after clip of ammo into him for two or three minutes until he went down. Avatar fills in the basic action-game checklist, but it's just not a well put-together game.<br/> <br/> It's a shame, too, because <i>someone</i> at Ubisoft wanted to add some depth to this game. There's a pretty robust experience and level-up system in here that gradually earns you better weapons and armor, along with a whole host of special abilities, to use in combat. But it's a pain to constantly enter the menu and swap those weapons and abilities in and out, and then, the campaign isn't an entertaining place to use them anyway. Then there's the almost inexplicable inclusion of a \"conquest\" mode that resembles the board game Risk, where you deploy units to take over abstract territories on the globe of Pandora and reap benefits that apply back to the single-player game. But since the currency in the conquest mode comes from the experience you get in the campaign, it makes it much easier to succeed in conquest after playing most of the campaign, at which point those benefits won't mean much. It's a weird, unfortunate catch-22 situation. More generally, it's pretty faint praise for Avatar that I found this conquest mode one of the more enjoyable segments of the whole game.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042870-avatar01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042870\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1728\" style=\"width: 1728px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1042870-avatar01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1042870\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042870-avatar01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1042870-avatar01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Curse you, military-industrial complex!\u00a0</figcaption></figure>I also feel compelled to mention the presence of a multiplayer mode, but only because one is, well, present. The campaign's action is mapped onto a series of perfunctory online modes--capture the flag, king of the hill, and deathmatch among them--that aren't much fun to play at all. I don't care how much balance work was done here; you can't give one team machine guns and powered armor and pit them against another side with clubs and bows, and expect it to be fun. Further consider the nearly complete lack of appropriate matchmaking features and I would recommend you stick to the comparatively entertaining campaign if you do end up in possession of this game.<br/> <br/>Avatar is generally a flat-looking game by contemporary standards, but it's worth noting as one of the first games to support a wide array of modern 3D technology. Don't expect to whip out an old '50s pair of red-and-blue glasses to use them, though; you need a new television set equipped with specific 3D hardware to use any of it. If brands like Sensio and RealD mean anything to you, Avatar might make for a novel demo, but don't expect the game itself to be much fun. (Don't count on a few throwaway lines from Sigourney Weaver to enhance the storytelling much, either.)<br/> <br/> Fancy whiz-bang 3D effects wouldn't do much to rescue the clunky, mundane action here anyway. <i>Avatar</i>, the film, may indeed advance the art of filmmaking as its tremendous hype has portended--the early reviews at the time of this writing are positive enough, anyway--but Avatar: The Game won't change the poor reputation of movie-licensed games one iota.", "deck": "Playing this mediocre tie-in shooter might make you want to skip James Cameron's latest movie completely.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-243/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26589/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/james-camerons-avatar-the-game/3030-26589/", "id": 26589, "name": "James Cameron's Avatar: The Game"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2009-12-11 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-86005/", "id": 86005, "name": "James Cameron's Avatar: The Game"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/qix-review/1900-244/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1210890-qix13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1210890\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1210890-qix13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1210890\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/112/1210890-qix13.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The power-up blocks are reminiscent of Volfied.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>There was always something cool about the way classic arcade games seemed like they could last forever. Sure, they'd eventually get prohibitively difficult, but you always had that feeling that maybe... just maybe... you could play the game forever on one quarter. That's why it's so weird that <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29395\" href=\"/qix-plus-plus/3030-29395/\" slug=\"qix-plus-plus\">QIX++</a>, a new <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">Xbox Live Arcade</a> update of the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-135\" href=\"/taito-corporation/3010-135/\" slug=\"taito-corporation\">Taito</a> arcade classic, Qix, only has 16 levels. Rather than trying to see how far you can go, QIX++ has exactly 16 levels. It's the sort of thing you could complete in under an hour, and unless you're going to start fiending over your leaderboard position, there's not much else to do.<br/> <br/> For those of you without a proper base of Qix knowledge to work from, your goal is to use your triangular marker to draw lines on the screen, sectioning off portions of the playfield. You need to claim a significant percentage--usually 75 percent--to move forward. Standing in your way is the Qix itself. The Qix, originally just a strip of color-cycling lines, twists and turns around the playfield. If the Qix collides with your marker or with the line you're drawing, you take a hit. If you run out of shields, the game ends. As you move through the levels, the Qix takes different shapes, making it a bit harder to predict and, thus, a bit tougher to contain. But not all that tough, really. The game has two sections, each with eight levels. It's possible to whip through both of those sections on your first try. While the game has leaderboards in place for a third and fourth section, that appears to be for DLC purposes. Selling a 10 dollar game that's over in an hour and has obvious hooks in place for add-on content feels like... a bit much.<br/> <br/> There's a bit more to QIX++, though. You can play multiplayer games, which allow up to four players. In these competitive rounds, the player who claims the most territory wins. Like many other Xbox Live Arcade releases, finding online players seems to be something of a rarity. The matches I got into were a little jumpy and definitely not as smooth as the average online game. You can play locally, though, so if you like the idea of fighting for territory while avoiding a Qix with friends, the option is there. It doesn't really add much to the core game either way.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1210900-qix22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1210900\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56666666666667\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/112/1210900-qix22.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1210900\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/112/1210900-qix22.jpg\"></a><figcaption>This longer Qix can be tricky to contain.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Visually, QIX++ is disappointing. While the game tries to paint some kind of weird \"evil cyber crime virus\" motif in the two pages of pause screen text that serve as its story, the backgrounds and designs of the different Qix are very plain and unimaginative. Remakes and updates of arcade classics have been done with far more class in the past, and Qix is a game that's practically begging for some sort of <a data-ref-id=\"3040-15028\" href=\"/jeff-minter/3040-15028/\" slug=\"jeff-minter\">Jeff Minter</a>-like hyperfreakout visual treatment.

Shooter is at its best when it's requiring you to puzzle out the best way to stay out of the lava as you attempt to carefully extract human survivors from the depths of an alien planet. The unfortunate part is that the game feels like it spends most of its time on easy, almost tutorial-like levels that illustrate how the world's different substances work together. And by the time you've got it all figured out, it ends.<br/> <br/> PixelJunk Shooter controls similarly to the average dual-joystick shooter, but you'll use R1 to fire, rather than just pointing the right stick in a direction to start shooting. The L1 button is used to fire your claw, which scoops up human survivors, bonus diamonds that are strewn about the levels, and a few other objects. If you hold down R1, you'll fire out missiles, which are more powerful than your normal shots. But firing missiles generates heat, which is the true enemy in PixelJunk Shooter.<br/> <br/> Instead of a shield meter or some sort of hull integrity graph, the measure of your wellness is a heat gauge. Doing things like getting near lava or drifting through hot smoke will cause your heat gauge to start creeping up. If it fills, your ship starts to crash downward, which will probably kill you unless you happen to touchdown in a pool of water. Water is plentiful in these underground areas, and submerging yourself instantly cools you off.<br/> <br/> The interplay between the fiery lava and bodies of water is central to PixelJunk Shooter. When the two substances collide, the water dissipates as the lava is cooled and turned into a soft solid that you can shoot through. This gives you ways to proceed down through pools of lava, which usually leads to a survivor or two. Other substances add a bit more complexity to these interactions, like hot gas that rises out of the ground in some levels. If it connects with lava, the gas starts exploding, which will cause you to overheat if you're caught in the blast area, but it's also useful for blasting through walls of ice. There's also an oily, magnetic substance in later levels that reacts with water to form more of that explosive gas. All of this state-changing fluid might sound complicated, but the game introduces you to these interactions very slowly and deliberately, making it nearly impossible to miss.<br/> <br/> It's a bit easier, however, to miss all of the diamonds that are hidden around the corners of many levels. You grab the diamonds just like you were picking up a human, and at first, they just seem like any other collectible bonus item. But the diamonds are actually more important than the humans, as you won't be allowed into an episode's final area unless you've collected enough diamonds to open the area. It's a bit of a weird mechanic, at first, since the game puts way more of a visible emphasis on saving humans. While losing too many humans will force you to retry a level, as soon as you slow down and stop unloading as many bullets as possible into every threat in your path, saving the humans is easy, and they're all right out in the open. This forced me to backtrack on a few occasions, as I'd have no trouble saving every human in an area, but I'd still have to find more diamonds before I could proceed. Once you know what to look for, finding diamonds isn't especially challenging, either.<br/> <br/> Mechanically, PixelJunk Shooter is awesome. The viscous fluids slosh around believably, and manipulating them in various ways is really satisfying. You'll also find power-up suits that make some levels feel a little different by giving you the ability to survive in lava (at the expense of making water completely deadly), repel the gooey magnetic fluid, or shoot water or lava out of your ship. You'll even have to deal with three boss fights, one for each episode, which is the one place where the name \"Shooter\" makes a ton of sense. But PixelJunk Shooter doesn't give you enough levels that put all of its different elements together. There are no massive, fluid-based puzzles in Shooter. In fact, as you proceed and discover new fluids, the game devotes a few too many levels to simply illustrating how the new fluids or power-ups you're encountering interact with one another. The last few levels of the game are great, but just as it's settling into a groove and starting to actually get challenging, you're confronted by a final boss and the game ends, offering little more than a \"to be continued\" screen.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1147454-959884_20090602_790screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1147454\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5620253164557\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1147454-959884_20090602_790screen002.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1147454\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1147454-959884_20090602_790screen002.jpg\"></a><figcaption>All of the fluids have a gooey thickness to them that makes them move in interesting and realistic ways.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>There are, of course, additional options for completists. The game keeps track of how many diamonds you've collected and which levels you've cleared without letting any humans die, so replaying those areas to completely clear them is certainly an option. You can also play through the entire game with a second player. This makes minimal changes to some levels, usually in spots where both players would need an inverter suit to get through some lava. But it doesn't dramatically change the game, plus it also forces both players to remain relatively close together, as the action doesn't zoom out or split into two screens to let players roam a bit more freely. With those limitations, areas of the game require a lot of communication and cooperation, so it makes some sense that it's limited to local players. But since the level continues forward as long as one player is alive, and players that fail are respawned after ten seconds of down time, there isn't too much incentive to actually cooperate. PixelJunk Shooter is better as a solo mission.<br/> <br/> Despite feeling like the tutorial mode for its eventual Encore-style follow-up, PixelJunk Shooter's unique mechanics and terrific audiovisual design still make it stand out in ways that most downloadable releases lack. Like the other games in the line, PixelJunk Shooter's got <i>style</i>. The great-looking graphics and cohesive soundtrack make it a lot easier to look past the game's structural issues and a lot easier to recommend, too.

(It's a shame all Wii games aren't that way, but, let's face it, they aren't.) The game uses motion controls and the Wii remote's speaker to draw you into its mysterious, unsettling world more effectively than you might expect. But as good as the Wii integration is, it's the nuanced storyline and chilling atmosphere that will really stick with you. Despite a little repetition in the game's progression, this is one experience you aren't likely to forget soon.<br/> <br/> Shattered Memories is one of those newfangled \"reboots\" that distills the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-356\" href=\"/silent-hill/3025-356/\" slug=\"silent-hill\">Silent Hill</a> series down to its core--psychological horror--and takes it in a new direction. The similarities to the series' original installment are few. You're again <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1109\" href=\"/harry-mason/3005-1109/\" slug=\"harry-mason\">Harry Mason</a>, looking for your young daughter Cheryl after a car crash strands you in the idyllic small town of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-67\" href=\"/silent-hill/3035-67/\" slug=\"silent-hill\">Silent Hill</a>, nearly deserted in the midst of a blizzard. There's still a weird fixation on radio static and analog video effects, used to enhance the tension. Uh, did I mention your daughter is named <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2724\" href=\"/cheryl-mason/3005-2724/\" slug=\"cheryl-mason\">Cheryl</a>?<br/> <br/> The point is, the comparisons end there. No more hellish, industrial-looking otherworld, no more occult business... and no combat. Shattered Memories is, for all intents and purposes, an adventure game in which you play through a series of loosely connected vignettes depicting Harry's mostly fruitless search of the town. The places and events you encounter as you move through the narrative become increasingly weird and hard to process, but despite appearances, they are leading you somewhere specific and revelatory. Describing a list of example encounters in this review would really take away from the net effect of bafflement and tension you feel as you play them yourself. Since those feelings are largely what make this rendition of Silent Hill so memorable, let it suffice that this is an especially strange, moody game that's probably a little like what David Lynch would make if he were into video game development.<br/> <br/> One of Shattered Memories' best aspects is Harry's <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" slug=\"iphone\">iPhone</a>-like cell phone, which sounds like a gimmick but actually makes you feel more connected to the game world. In addition to a map function, the phone has a camera in it that lets you reveal ghostly afterimages of past events when you take pictures of the right places (and the camera screen has a convincingly low-resolution stutter when you use it). The world is full of psychic artifacts like these that may seem like non-sequiturs at first, but they usually have some sort of subtle bearing on the plot. They're all honestly creepy in their own right, anyway. Imagine finding a lone sleeping bag out in the woods, then seeing blood stains spread across it as you approach, then getting a text message from a stranger about how maybe they shouldn't have slipped something into that girl's drink. It's pretty unsettling stuff.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/951285-77141520090410_140656_0_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-951285\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5609375\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7423/951285-77141520090410_140656_0_big.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-951285\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7423/951285-77141520090410_140656_0_big.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The Wii controls are really nicely designed.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Speaking of which, you'll also get occasional phone calls, text messages, and voice mails (some from familiar characters and some from... who knows?) that depict seemingly random, unsettling events in ways that subtly tie into the core storyline. The phone calls and voice mails come out of the Wii remote's speaker, which just happens to sound exactly like a cell phone. Holding it up to your ear, to hear things like a girl begging her mother to pick her up from the party where she has suddenly found herself amid some very bad people, has to be one of the most creative and affecting uses of that dinky speaker to date.<br/> <br/> The flow of Shattered Memories gets down to a formula pretty quickly. Each episode is framed by a visit to a psychotherapist that's apparently taking place in the present day, as Harry and his shrink work their way through the trauma of the car crash and subsequent search. Then you flash back to the next leg of Harry's ordeal in Silent Hill. The first half of these vignettes consists of you searching the town and occasionally meeting up with the game's few supporting characters, looking for clues. As creepy as some of the events are during these segments, you come to realize pretty quickly that you aren't in any real danger during your search. You can't die here; there are no vicious beasts waiting to jump out and ambush you, nor even environmental hazards that can put an end to Harry. These sequences are more about absorbing the storyline and getting wrapped up in the unsettling atmosphere than fearing for your life.<br/> <br/> But then, every time you feel like you're coming up on some sort of conclusion or breakthrough, the world ices over and you're suddenly beset by the sort of ugly, faceless monsters that would make<a data-ref-id=\"3005-2442\" href=\"/pyramid-head/3005-2442/\" slug=\"pyramid-head\"> Pyramid Head</a> proud. But you can't fight them. In every episode, these repeated encounters really just amount to an extended chase sequence, as you run from the monstrosities and frantically try to reach whatever place it is that will let you escape. These chases are mostly successful at engendering a real sense of terror; the helplessness you feel at being unable to fight the monsters, only dodge them and shove them off, is palpable. At least at first. Knowing that another chase is always coming at the end of each episode makes them a little less scary, but the creatures are sufficiently unpleasant enough in sound and appearance that you sure don't want to spend more time around them than you have to.<br/> \u00a0<br/>Playing the game is mostly a pleasant experience. The Wii remote is used to great effect as a pointer for Harry's flashlight, which feels natural in your hand and lights up your surroundings with strikingly nice-looking lighting effects. Motion is also used in some clever ways in some puzzles, allowing you to manipulate cabinet doors, empty cans, and so forth as you look for keys and other objects. Even the motion controls during the chase sequences play into the action; you basically have to flail frantically in the direction of an attacking monster to shove it off of you. The relative imprecision of the Wii's controls can be vexing sometimes during the fast action of the chases, though, since you won't always knock an attacker off on the first try, and you'll sometimes make a wrong turn as you use the pointer to steer the camera.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1049384-27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1049384\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"720\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1049384-27.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1049384\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1049384-27.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1049384-27.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Gross.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>One of the most interesting and yet least apparent aspects of Shattered Memories is the long list of ways it reacts to your play style. From the questions and psych tests your therapist throws at you to just about everything you do while exploring, the particulars of the storyline can change dramatically. The game determines which areas of the town you have access to, what supporting characters look like and how they act toward you, even the personality of Harry himself (right down to the comments he makes on the things he sees). The thing is, none of this is obvious the first time you play through the game; the story simply comes off as, well, the way it is. But there's real merit in playing through again, making significantly different choices and giving different answers to see what changes. A striking amount of it will. For what it's worth, I found that giving honest answers to the therapist's questions and playing according to my gut produced an outcome that was very much in line with my sensibilities. For once, your mileage will definitely vary.<br/> <br/> Silent Hill: Shattered Memories takes some bold, unpredictable risks with this venerated franchise, and the result is a heck of a lot more interesting than yet another survival horror game with motion-assisted aiming might have been. And thanks to the careful handling of the narrative, it's an indelible experience that proves you don't need endless shooting and buckets of blood to produce a mature, resonant horror experience, on the Wii or on any other platform. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "A laundry list of risky changes pays off in this great new beginning for the Silent Hill series.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-246/", "platforms": "Wii", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25707/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/silent-hill-shattered-memories/3030-25707/", "id": 25707, "name": "Silent Hill: Shattered Memories"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2009-12-27 07:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84342/", "id": 84342, "name": "Silent Hill: Shattered Memories"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/borderlands-review/1900-247/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213893\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1213893\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1213893-dlc2_launch_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The rules are simple: kill or be killed.\u00a0</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3005-13441\" href=\"/mad-moxxi/3005-13441/\" slug=\"mad-moxxi\">Mad Moxxi</a> could be a great character, but the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\" href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/\" slug=\"borderlands\">Borderlands</a> expansion bearing her name--Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot--is a real dud. Taking the combat of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1615\" href=\"/gearbox-software-llc/3010-1615/\" slug=\"gearbox-software-llc\">Gearbox</a>'s first-person action-RPG and cramming it into a wave-based arena format that draws comparisons to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24035\" href=\"/halo-3-odst/3030-24035/\" slug=\"halo-3-odst\">Halo 3: ODST</a>'s Firefight mode isn't an awful idea. But by stripping away all of the character progression and loot-scavenging that gives the whole game its hook, you're left with combat for combat's sake, which makes for an extremely repetitive and empty experience.\u00a0<br/><br/> The best thing about the entire add-on is the intro. Much like the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\" href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/reviews/?review_id=239/\" slug=\"borderlands\">Zombie Island</a> expansion before it, Mad Moxxi opens with a brief, stylized sequence that introduces you to the sultry-voiced Moxxi and sets up her fetishistic desire to watch combatants in the arena. But she mostly manifests as the announcer, chiming in while you fight to let you know that a player has gone down or that another is doing well. She also makes a few movie references, which at this point is standard for Borderlands. The only real issue is that there's not enough dialogue from her, leading to a lot of repetition.<br/><br/>The action takes place in three different arenas, each of which look and feel like medium-sized deathmatch arenas built with assets found in other parts of the game. You and up to three other players enter the arena to take on waves of enemies, like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3930\" href=\"/skag/3015-3930/\" slug=\"skag\">skags</a>, bandits, members of the Crimson Lance, guardians, and the like. Every fifth wave is a boss wave, and a curtain is literally pulled back to reveal one of the main game's named minibosses, like Nine-Toes, One-Eyed Jack, or Master McCloud. The bosses are randomized, so you never know who you'll get until they're announced.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>So the game progresses from wave to wave, pausing for a bit between waves to shower you with ammo and health items, and pausing for a while longer between each round (five waves) to let you collect a few weapons. The weapons appear to be randomly generated, though in all my time in the Underdome, using characters of different levels, I never once found a gun worth using. Considering the length of time you'll spend clearing these arenas, the lack of loot is an extreme disappointment. Enemies don't drop anything at all when they die, so the guns that pop out after a boss round are all you'll get.<br/> <br/> Your first time in each arena will be a five-round battle. This is a decent length, but by the end of these \"short\" tournaments, you'll probably feel like you're finished with each of the new areas. So it doesn't help much that completing this first task qualifies you for longer, 20-round tournaments. Yes, that's 100 waves of repetitive battle per location, with the difficulty slowly ratcheting up as you move from one round to the next. The content--really, just the three arenas themselves and whatever dialogue you get out of Moxxi--is stretched way too thin here.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5275/1224287-madmoxxi_header.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224287\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.2141414141414\" data-width=\"495\" style=\"width: 495px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:121.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5275/1224287-madmoxxi_header.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224287\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/5275/1224287-madmoxxi_header.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Moxxi!\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The game attempts to throw in some variety as you proceed by adding up to four different modifiers, one of which changes after every wave. The modifiers are implemented similarly to the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-641\" href=\"/skull/3055-641/\" slug=\"skull\">skulls</a> in ODST's Firefight mode, and they make basic alterations to the action, like lower gravity, bonus damage for specific weapon types (at the expense of a damage penalty on the other weapons), headshot bonuses, no shields, or vampire, which causes your health to slowly drain when you aren't killing. Vampire, incidentally, is the subject of most of my wrath, as it happened to be active during a wave that glitched out and wouldn't end, despite all of the enemies being killed. I was left to slowly watch as everyone's health meters emptied out, killing off the entire team.<br/> <br/> Completing Mad Moxxi's Underdome Riot will get you two additional skill points, and there's also an item bank, which lets you store any of the weird weapons you've found, but don't want to actively use. These are nice benefits, especially for players who have hit the level cap and are looking for something--anything--that will let them advance.

It then hurls that baton off a cliff, tears off all its clothes, and then jumps after the baton, laughing maniacally the entire time. Primarily using a punch and a kick button, with the occasional swirl of the analog stick for more advanced moves, you'll produce a nearly infinite string of consistently outlandish combos, the best of which turn Bayonetta's hair-suit into gigantic fists, feet, or monsters that reduce your enemies to red paste. These moves also temporarily remove strategic bits of Bayonetta's outfit, furthering the game's peculiar stripper theme. Your guns are good for ranged attacks and generally just add to the fun, much like the torturous finishing moves you can perform that manifest iron maidens and guillotines for you to punish your foes with.

There are also a few fights that take place entirely in Witch Time, which add another layer of slow-motion chaos to the already overwhelming action. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Despite how manic the fights can get, Bayonetta is surprisingly approachable, though don't take that as a euphemism for \u201ceasy.\u201d As similar as it is to your Devil May Crys or your <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25586\" href=\"/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2/3030-25586/\" slug=\"ninja-gaiden-sigma-2\">               Ninja Gaidens</a>, Bayonetta rewards good timing more than it does rote combo memorization, making it a less technically demanding experience without shorting you on the difficulty. It definitely scolds you for dying, putting a permanent mark on your record that has an adverse effect on your overall score, but it also gives you the tools to avoid it. You'll gain access to additional weapons like a katana and alternate guns as you progress, and you'll also collect halos (which look suspiciously like the kinds of rings <a data-ref-id=\"3005-73\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" slug=\"sonic-the-hedgehog\">            Sonic the Hedgehog</a> can't seem to get enough of) that you can spend on new moves and various <a data-ref-id=\"3055-639\" href=\"/lollipop/3055-639/\" slug=\"lollipop\">           lollipops</a> that restore health, make you temporarily invincible, or give your attacks more punch.

They're both awesome sequences, some of the game's most memorable, but they're just the most obvious examples of Bayonetta's almost subconscious reverence for classic Japanese game culture. Mostly, though, Bayonetta keeps you on your toes by constantly pushing just how over-the-top everything about it is. You're just as likely to fight a freaky two-headed dragon while half-naked on the side of a church that's spinning through space as you are on <i>terra firma. </i>When that's your standard, it's possible for just about anything to happen, and in Bayonetta, it usually does. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Visually, Bayonetta is defined by a constant state of information overload. In the rare moments that the camera's not voyeuristically twirling around Bayonetta's suggestively gyrating figure as she smashes a cherub-faced angel-monster, you can actually appreciate the incredible detail on Bayonetta herself, the dizzying complexity of the intricately choreographed dance-fight sequences, the unsettling enemy designs that graft familiar angelic imagery and bits of Renaissance marble onto a menagerie of hideously meaty bird-creatures and golems. There's a lot of craft in Bayonetta's whole rococo <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2534\" href=\"/steampunk/3015-2534/\" slug=\"steampunk\">        steampunk</a> aesthetic, but it's just as impressive that the game performs so well when it's awash in layer upon layer of crazy effects, while all of it moves at just below the speed of light.

That doesn't stop the game from spending an inordinate amount of time dwelling on prophecies, the agents of heaven and hell, forgotten identities, parallel planes of existence, misplaced revenge fantasies, and epoch-spanning conspiracies. I'd admonish Bayonetta for its lengthy, corny, dialog-heavy cutscenes, but it kind of emphasizes just how Japanese this game is. Plus, the oddly staged dialog scenes are consistently paired with some of the most outrageous cinematics I've seen in any game, the kinds of unbelievable moments that whip right past awesome on their way to hilarity. There are plenty of occasions where you'll have to quick-time your way through a cinematic, but often they're so intense that you'll be grateful when you can focus your energies on keeping up with just what in the holy hot hell is going on. <br/>\u00a0<br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1238957-t_bayonetta_combat_montage_gp_gt_hd_69.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1238957\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1238957-t_bayonetta_combat_montage_gp_gt_hd_69.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1238957\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1238957-t_bayonetta_combat_montage_gp_gt_hd_69.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1238957-t_bayonetta_combat_montage_gp_gt_hd_69.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Bayonetta is the rare game that can make you grin and grit your teeth at the same time.</figcaption></figure>  Bayonetta even <i>sounds</i>  crazy.

While the words they are saying are borderline gibberish, the voice work is actually pretty good, with Bayonetta in particular benefiting from the assertiveness of her speech. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Unfortunately, most of the kind words I have for Bayonetta are reserved for the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-20\" href=\"/xbox-360/3045-20/\" slug=\"xbox-360\">     Xbox 360</a> version, as the <a data-ref-id=\"3045-35\" href=\"/playstation-3/3045-35/\" slug=\"playstation-3\">    PlayStation 3</a> version suffers from crippling performance issues. Load times are bad, even popping up when you're simply cycling through options on your inventory menus, but what really kills it is the way the game stutters and chops through the action, dropping frames and bogging down at an almost constant rate. In another, significantly less intense game, it's something I might be able to let slide. But Bayonetta's gameplay, and even its cinematics, put such a premium on speed and precision that the experience on the PlayStation 3 is thoroughly compromised. Let me be totally clear here: if you have the option between the two consoles, consider the PlayStation 3 version to be nonexistent. If the PS3 is your only option, well, proceed with significant caution, or hitch your hopes on the notion that Sega might, someday, release a patch to address these issues. <br/>\u00a0<br/>For as many different games as Bayonetta specifically recalls, there's really nothing quite like it.

It's interesting because the elements that come from other games are overt, core parts of the game, rather than subtle bites of a more-famous franchise. Despite the way that Darksiders makes you think of some other game at every turn, it doesn't feel like some copycat piece of trash. Instead, all this \"borrowing\" results in a game that, at times, feels a whole lot like Nintendo's Legend of Zelda series. And it's done well enough that folks looking for a Zelda-style adventure won't be disappointed.<br/> <br/> That's not to say that Darksiders deals in fairies, elves, and bright colors. You play as War, one of the four horsemen of the apocalypse. At the outset, War is called into action in the middle of a raging battle between <a data-ref-id=\"3035-25\" href=\"/heaven/3035-25/\" slug=\"heaven\"> Heaven</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-24\" href=\"/hell/3035-24/\" slug=\"hell\"> Hell</a>. But the rest of the horsemen are nowhere to be found. War rides alone as humanity is decimated, and somehow the whole mess gets pinned on him. With Heaven's warriors and Hell's demons out to get him, War sets out to figure out how the armies were called into battle and, eventually, clear his name of any wrongdoing. The story lurches a bit in spots, especially near the beginning of the game, but as more and more blanks get filled in, Darksiders' narrative gets stronger and stronger, culminating in a conclusion that answers all of the questions asked during the previous 15 hours while also setting things up for what would probably make for a pretty cool sequel.<br/> <br/> The structure of Darksiders has War traveling across larger <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1004\" href=\"/overworld/3015-1004/\" slug=\"overworld\"> overworld</a>-type areas on his way to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1263\" href=\"/temple/3035-1263/\" slug=\"temple\"> temple</a>-like areas, which offer various types of puzzle solving, new items, and big boss battles. Along the way, you'll experience plenty of combat. Darksiders has a fairly well-developed combat system that'll certainly reward you for just mashing buttons, but you can exchange the game's currency (souls, naturally) for additional attacks and weapons. The extra moves let you execute dash attacks, pop-up attacks that set up lengthy air combos, and so on. It's not entirely unlike <a data-ref-id=\"3025-244\" href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" slug=\"god-of-war\"> God of War</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3025-147\" href=\"/devil-may-cry/3025-147/\" slug=\"devil-may-cry\"> Devil May Cry</a>, if I may cram yet another game name or two into this review. The combat ends up feeling really satisfying as you get better and better at the additional moves, but the defensive end of the fighting, which lets you block, counter, and dash all by using the right bumper in various ways, doesn't feel as responsive as it should, making it tough to act with precision when you're being swarmed by angry demons.<br/> <br/> As the game sends you off in the direction of big boss battles, you'll occasionally encounter dungeon-like areas, which offer new ways to impede your progress. Some are merely combat challenges, which trap you in specific areas until you've defeated all of the enemies. Others are puzzle-oriented, so you'll move some blocks around to reach higher areas or employ some of your additional gear to light torches, swing from one hookshot target to the next, or trigger items that slow time for a brief period, which allows you to quickly run across a worm-infested area without getting swallowed whole. You'll acquire new items in these areas which will invariably pay off when facing the boss of that spot. The bosses, predictably, adhere to the rule of threes... you know, just like that Nintendo series we were talking about earlier?<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1234809-t_darksiders_hellbook4_ruin_doc_emb_hd_70.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234809\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1234809-t_darksiders_hellbook4_ruin_doc_emb_hd_70.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234809\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1234809-t_darksiders_hellbook4_ruin_doc_emb_hd_70.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Shields will shatter!\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Darksiders has extremely thick, tough-looking characters. War stomps around the landscape and moves like a serious bad-ass, while demons and other nefarious creatures slink and creep around like the scum that they are and the angels try to fly just out of reach of War's huge sword. There's also a lot of great facial animation to be found. Samael, a demon with which you have a tenuous alliance through much of the game, is a twisted creature, but the detail in his face still manages to convey some effective emotion. The environments look a little too clean in some spots, but overall, the world is full of nice-looking variety that makes each new area a treat to see. On the technical side, the game maintains a good frame rate, but the Xbox 360 version is saddled with an aggressive amount of screen tearing that starts to get in the way as you spend more and more time with the game.<br/> <br/> The visuals are backed up by a solid soundtrack and, for the most part, some outstanding voice acting. War maintains a slow, measured tone throughout the game that further establishes him as a guy that is not to be messed with. War's constant companion is The Watcher, an evil-sounding demon who is there to make sure that War performs his assigned task. The Watcher, voiced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-3248\" href=\"/mark-hamill/3040-3248/\" slug=\"mark-hamill\"> Mark Hamill</a>, sounds like a cross between <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1786\" href=\"/starscream/3005-1786/\" slug=\"starscream\"> Starscream</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-952\" href=\"/the-joker/3005-952/\" slug=\"the-joker\"> The Joker</a>, and I found the voice to be the most grating thing about the entire game. The Watcher is designed to serve as a <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1176\" href=\"/navi/3005-1176/\" slug=\"navi\"> Navi</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2015\" href=\"/midna/3005-2015/\" slug=\"midna\"> Midna</a>-like character, if you'll forgive yet another direct mention of the Zelda franchise. But the \"advice\" he offers is never especially useful and he comes across as very repetitive.<br/> <br/> While you can explain a lot of things about Darksiders by listing off other games that are directly referenced during the adventure, the game doesn't feel like some simple clone.

Considering the bulk of the shooter genre rarely gets more complicated than \"aim reticle at face, pull trigger,\" getting you to do a bit of thinking as you shoot is a welcome concept, much like it was in the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20479\" href=\"/army-of-two/3030-20479/\" slug=\"army-of-two\">first</a> Army of Two game. But the rest of the balance is off. Most of your enemies go down so quickly that as long as you utilize cover and are a decent shot, it's way faster to just aim the reticle at an enemy's face and pull the trigger. The core of The 40th Day feels decidedly hollow as a result, and this short shooter is a mostly mindless and repetitive experience.<br/><br/>The game is built to point you directly at the action. Though you'll get a little bit of radio chatter as the two mercenaries talk with their handler and a few other characters, the story--the reason why Shanghai is getting blasted apart--is mostly relegated to the pause menu. Once paused, you can dig out some radio recordings that are collected along the way to sort of piece together the identity the game's lead villain and maybe even a few of his motivations. Considering how poorly justified the game's activities are by those recordings, maybe it's for the best that they take a back seat to the shooting. Still, the game opens with what could have been a great hook--the absolute destruction of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-343\" href=\"/china/3035-343/\" slug=\"china\">Shanghai</a>. Buildings all across the skyline are ripped apart, if not by bombs, then by helicopters or planes crashing into them. The first chapter sets up some incredible-looking chaos, but there's no followthrough. Once the initial destruction is over with, the game's environments just look like any other war-torn part of the world. By the end of the game, when you finally confront the man responsible for the attack, you won't even be sure why you want to stop him so badly. Heck, I managed to get through something like 98 percent of the game without even learning the guy's name.<br/><br/>In what must have been an attempt to humanize the characters of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1201\" href=\"/elliot-salem/3005-1201/\" slug=\"elliot-salem\">Salem</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1562\" href=\"/tyson-rios/3005-1562/\" slug=\"tyson-rios\">Rios</a> a bit, the game presents you with one moral quandary per chapter. It starts when your initial contact for your first mission turns out to be on your shadowy employer's hit list. Do you kill the guy that helped you get through the early part of the game for a little extra cash, or have you become attached to him in the game's first five or ten minutes? When these moments hit, you're given two button presses that choose which moral path you'll take. After that, the game cuts to a series of static, comic book-like images that extrapolate your actions into some sort of eventual conclusion. In the above example, killing the guy shows a few shots of his face and his ID, attempting to drive the point home that you killed a man after you've just spent the last few minutes gunning down plenty of other men. If you let him live, the sequence shows your new best friend sitting on a beach... where he's killed by an assassin. The \"good guy\" choices too often end with this sort of \"oh, well, he died anyway\" or \"the person you thought you saved was a bad person\" twist, which makes the whole system a little ugly because it's constantly hitting you over the head with the notion that no choice is the right choice.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1177308-ao2_tfd_oct_shots_3_1256225803.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1177308\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1177308-ao2_tfd_oct_shots_3_1256225803.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1177308\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1177308-ao2_tfd_oct_shots_3_1256225803.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Sticking together is still your best bet for survival.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>For the most part, the gameplay in The 40th Day hasn't changed too much over its predecessor. It's still a co-operative shooter that places some level of importance on drawing or avoiding the enemy's attention. This is illustrated via an on-screen aggro meter that sways back and forth between Salem and Rios. The player doing the most shooting, typically, is deemed the biggest threat by the game's opposition. This sets up opportunities for the other player to flank around the side of enemy positions and take them out while their attention is elsewhere. You can also influence the amount of aggro drawn by your antics by upgrading your weapon. Silencers and camouflage patterns make your gun seem like less of a threat than a big, loud rifle with a 100-round drum attached to it. As in the previous game, you can also buy a \"pimped\" design for the gun that decks it out in gaudy gold. I can't blame the game's enemies for wanting to blast a guy coming at them with a big gold gun. If you're feeling extra luxurious, you can also upgrade to gold, diamond-encrusted grenades... which don't seem to provide any benefit at all.<br/><br/>While the aggro system works as intended, it's rarely a necessity. As you upgrade your firepower to bigger and better rifles, you'll be taking down the basic enemies with only a few shots. The guns feel overpowered, and as a result it's far easier to just take cover and eliminate every enemy in range with short bursts of assault rifle fire than it is to set up a situation where one player draws attention while the other slips around the side. The exception is that you'll occasionally face heavily armored enemies that need to be shot in the back.<br/><br/>Though the seven-chapter campaign is certainly better with a live human controlling your partner, the game can, of course, be played alone. When doing so, you'll be able to give a few orders to your partner, which lets you control when he'll advance, when he'll stick by your side, and when he'll stop and take cover. This lets you order your partner to sit still and lay down enough cover fire to give you a chance to run around, plinking enemies off one by one. In the event that you get dropped by the opposition, your partner can drag you to safety and shoot you full of life-giving drugs, which get you back up on your feet immediately. The dragging controls are a little off, and when you're playing with an AI-controlled partner, he never seems too clear on the concept of dragging you to safety before attempting to heal you. This results in a lot of dumb, preventable deaths when playing alone. This was a problem in the first game, too, and it's sort of surprising that it hasn't been addressed.<br/><br/>In addition to the campaign, there are also a few different multiplayer modes. Extraction--a \"bonus\" mode that will only be available to people that pre-ordered the game for 30 days after the game's launch--is a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3567\" href=\"/survival-mode/3015-3567/\" slug=\"survival-mode\">wave-based survival mode</a> that lets four players work through 16 waves of enemy opposition. As you proceed, you move to different portions of a given map and the enemies get tougher. Since players can revive and reload each other, sticking together is rewarded. The rest of the online mode pits players against other players in teams. Even the game's deathmatch mode sticks to the Army of Two mentality by grouping you into teams of two. There's also a control point capture mode and warzone, which throws different types of objectives at you, one after the other, without leaving the map. The multiplayer modes allow for up to 10 players and can be played across six different maps. You're limited to a few different loadouts and weapon types in the multiplayer, which is unfortunate, since the gun customization is one of the best things about The 40th Day. As opposed to the single-player, where you feel like you're gunning down enemies with only a shot or two, the multiplayer combatants are more resilient, making the guns feel weak. There's dissonance between the two sides of Army of Two, and neither feels quite right.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1146342-958803_20090923_790screen017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146342\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56329113924051\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1146342-958803_20090923_790screen017.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146342\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1146342-958803_20090923_790screen017.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1146342-958803_20090923_790screen017.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The mounted guns are fun, but too inaccurate to be useful.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>While the ripped-up city of Shanghai ends up making for a generic-feeling backdrop for the action, the early parts of the game, which is when most of the explosions and collapsing buildings are found, look great. You'll get some nice shots of the Shanghai skyline, giving you a front-row seat as the city crashes down around you. Salem and Rios look appropriately tough, though the enemy variety is perhaps a bit lacking. The sound is also effective, from the different ways your guns can sound depending on if they're well-silenced or designed to draw as much attention as possible, to the voice acting. Video gaming's favorite leading man, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\" href=\"/nolan-north/3040-80008/\" slug=\"nolan-north\">Nolan North</a>, steps into the role of Salem for this sequel, which, depending on if you're tired of hearing <a data-ref-id=\"3005-162\" href=\"/nathan-drake/3005-162/\" slug=\"nathan-drake\">Nathan Drake</a> pop up in every third game or not, will either fit the wise-cracking character perfectly or drive you insane.<br/><br/>The 40th Day has a couple of technical glitches, and the 360 version of the game locked up on me a couple of times. But for the most part, it's a technically competent shooter with co-operative play. For some, that's plenty. But if you're more discerning about your shooters, you'll probably get bored of this one before you've seen the end credits. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "The 40th Day streamlines in spots, but it ends up feeling like a very straightforward and somewhat bland shooter.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-251/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25565/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/army-of-two-the-40th-day/3030-25565/", "id": 25565, "name": "Army of Two: The 40th Day"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-01-15 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-85800/", "id": 85800, "name": "Army of Two: The 40th Day"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/trajectile-review/1900-252/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1247706-object.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247706\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1247706-object.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247706\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1247706-object.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0All DSiWare games should have that little cell phone display.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-29660\" href=\"/trajectile/3030-29660/\" slug=\"trajectile\">Trajectile</a> is not afraid to show its influences. This new $5 DSiWare puzzle game from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-649\" href=\"/q-games-ltd/3010-649/\" slug=\"q-games-ltd\">Q-Games</a> (the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-763\" href=\"/pixeljunk/3025-763/\" slug=\"pixeljunk\">PixelJunk</a> people) immediately comes off as a lo-fi throwback to games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13049\" href=\"/breakout/3030-13049/\" slug=\"breakout\">Breakout</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4062\" href=\"/missile-command/3030-4062/\" slug=\"missile-command\">Missile Command</a>, but with a turn-based twist. The object is simple: point one or more rockets from the bottom of the screen at a group of blocks at the top, bouncing the rockets off of walls and other blocks to take out a number of glowing goal blocks scattered around each stage. There are a few different kinds of rockets--one that explodes in a large radius on impact, and another that will drill straight through several blocks--and a handful of power-ups you can use to your advantage. The goal is simple: take out the target blocks in the fewest number of turns possible to get the highest score.<br/> <br/> The conditions in each level are entirely set by the developers: the number of turns you get (three, five, or seven), the layout of the blocks, not to mention the type, order, and spacing of the rockets. So the game alternates between feeling satisfying and stilted. In some levels, you'll be setting up big chain reactions that clear half of the goal blocks in one turn, and feeling pretty proud of yourself. But just as often, you start to feel like there's one specific, right way to solve a given puzzle, and if you can't piece it together, you'll be lucky to finish the level at all in the allotted number of turns. (And if you do finish it, it will probably be via a sloppy, inefficient solution.) You can use the power-ups you pick up on any turn, which gives you a little flexibility... but not enough. The fixed positions of the ships constrains the level of creativity you can use to solve each puzzle more than I would have liked.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1247709-object_1.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247709\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"272\" style=\"width: 272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1247709-object_1.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247709\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/30/1247709-object_1.jpeg\"></a><figcaption>Trial, meet error.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The game also demands pixel-precise aiming via its stylus-only control, but the aiming isn't as responsive or sensitive as it needs to be to fine-tune some of your shots without some degree of trial and error. You'll find yourself moving the stylus a millimeter at a time, trying to change the trajectory of a shot just enough to bank it around a corner, and then sliding too far and going past the desired angle entirely. And forget about playing the game in a moving vehicle, which is exactly the sort of place I would expect to enjoy the bite-size gameplay DSiWare specializes in. Anything less than complete stability makes it nearly impossible to aim your shots and play the game effectively.<br/> <br/> At least there's a <i>ton</i> of content crammed into the game, with scores of levels spread across five difficulty tiers. You can play the levels in each tier out of order if you want, so you won't get stuck trying to beat a particular level without having dozens of other levels to try out instead. The game rolls out new levels and new block and power-up types to you smoothly as you progress, so if you really get into the angular puzzle-solving on offer here, you'll be able to keep doing it for a good long while.<br/> <br/> Trajectile assembles aspects of some classic old games into a unique and interesting puzzle experience, but it's limited enough in some ways that you may bump into some frustration with its trial-and-error approach from time to time.

But let me open the wound one more time by telling you that in <a data-ref-id=\"3010-367\" href=\"/capcom/3010-367/\" slug=\"capcom\">Capcom</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20703\" href=\"/dark-void/3030-20703/\" slug=\"dark-void\">Dark Void</a>, human beings encountered jet packs all the way back in 1938. One such human is <a data-ref-id=\"3005-356\" href=\"/will-grey/3005-356/\" slug=\"will-grey\">Will Grey</a>, the game's protagonist. His story is an interesting one, but a series of unfortunate technical glitches get in Dark Void's way.<br/> <br/> In fact, the fiction behind Dark Void and the way that story is presented are probably the best things about the game. It opens with a sort-of-stock \"plane gets sucked into the Bermuda Triangle\" event, and from there you discover a new world that is ruled by an oppressive race of shiny metal robots called the Watchers. These guys have their hooks in everything, both in the Void and in the real world. In the game's first cutscene, Will and an old flame named Ava get stranded in the Void. From there you'll encounter villages filled with humans who worship Watchers as if they were gods. You'll also encounter <a data-ref-id=\"3005-9322\" href=\"/nikola-tesla/3005-9322/\" slug=\"nikola-tesla\">Nikola Tesla</a>, who's been reengineering Watcher technology to help the stranded humans rise up against the Watchers. Will quickly gets his hands on a Tesla-built prototype jet pack and, just as he's about get in over his head, he meets up with the resistance and becomes a powerful new force in the fight.<br/> <br/> That fight takes place both on land and in the air. You'll start out the game on the ground, and when your feet are firmly planted there, it's a very familiar-feeling third-person shooter. You'll take cover behind objects and pop out to gun down the Watchers whenever they attack. Will starts out with a basic assault rifle, but you'll also have plenty of opportunities to use enemy weapons. The rest of these guns fill out the arsenal, and include equivalents to the standard <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">sniper rifle</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">rocket launcher</a>. There are six weapons in all, and each can be upgraded twice using tech points that you earn for collecting orbs that appear after kills. The weapons have a passable feel to them, but once you're fighting airborne Watchers that won't sit still, the amount of time you spend leading your targets will probably make you wish for some guns with faster projectiles. Also, most of the weapons are only especially useful in specific cases. I spent the bulk of my time using the Watcher version of the assault rifle. Still, blasting the Watcher robot suits apart and getting a look at what's inside is pretty satisfying, especially when you're landing head shots.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1234134-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_265.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234134\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1234134-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_265.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234134\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1234134-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_265.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Tesla's got your back.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>After a brief stint on foot, you're equipped with a hover pack. Though you're not going to do much flying in it, the ability to jump up and glide in the air for brief periods of time changes your tactics dramatically. When you can position yourself above the enemy's position, the cover they're hiding behind doesn't work so well. There's a certain \"death from above\" mentality that feels pretty good, though it doesn't take long for your foes to start employing the same tactics. As a result, you can't stand still for particularly long.<br/> <br/> After a level or two with this hover ability, you'll upgrade to a full-on jet pack. At this point, you can enter fly mode at any point... though if you aren't flying in an area that was clearly designed for full flight, you're likely to bump around into walls and meet a quick end. Taking flight often feels like you're barely in control, and at first, this can be frustrating. But as you get better at controlling your flights and--more importantly--you gain a better understanding of when you should actually choose to fly, it can be a lot of fun.<br/> <br/> When you're flying, the game takes on the control stylings of an arcade-style dogfighting game. A number of the folks behind Dark Void worked on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12911\" href=\"/crimson-skies-high-road-to-revenge/3030-12911/\" slug=\"crimson-skies-high-road-to-revenge\">Crimson Skies: High Road to Revenge</a> for the Xbox, and it shows in the way the air combat controls. You'll be able to pull off evasive maneuvers to dodge incoming fire as you fly around large canyons and face off against enemy UFOs. If you get close enough, you can even opt to steal one of these enemy flyers, but the half-<a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">Quick-Time-Event</a>, half-minigame you'll perform every time you want to get in a saucer gets tedious after its second or third appearance. The guns mounted on your jet pack are powerful, and Will is resilient enough to not really need the extra armor that a UFO provides, so once I got comfortable with the flight controls, I stopped UFO-jacking entirely. Other than a sequence where you have to fly around a large aircraft to power-up its engines manually, and then another sequence where you're defending said ship from waves of enemy attacks, most of your air time is spent knocking the same UFOs out of the sky. While the controls feel fine, the enemy's tactics never get tricky, and there are only around four different sky-based targets, one of which is a stationary mine.<br/> <br/> Though both the on-foot and flying action can get a little repetitive, the game's story carries things along well enough to make Dark Void worth seeing through to its cool-looking final battle and the story's conclusion. That said, the game has a few different technical issues that get in the way--at least on the Xbox 360. For starters, the frame rate gets uneven when the action heats up, both indoors and out. The texture pop-in that has become something of a signature for the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-86\" href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" slug=\"unreal-engine-3\">Unreal Engine</a> is present, as well, and in one case, I ran into a spot where the more detailed textures would fade in, then immediately pop out to become blurry again... only to fade back in a second later and repeat the whole process until the end of the cutscene. This all happened during a fairly climactic moment, which can really take you out of the story. Lastly, some of the speech stuttered a bit during cutscenes.<br/> <br/>The best part of Dark Void's presentation is its orchestrated soundtrack. Like a great piece of science-fiction television, Dark Void establishes a core melody, then revisits it in different ways, giving you a triumphant feel when appropriate, a down-trodden version for the darkest parts of the void, and, just for kicks, an 8-bit version to play over the end credits. It probably says something very specific about my tastes that it's that <a data-ref-id=\"3045-21\" href=\"/nes/3045-21/\" slug=\"nes\">NES</a>-style take on the theme that's stuck with me. The voicework is solid all around, with <a data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\" href=\"/nolan-north/3040-80008/\" slug=\"nolan-north\">Nolan North</a> heading things up as the voice of Will. He turns in a fine bit of work here, but little things, like the way he mutters \"I bruise easily\" when getting shot at, get a little too close to <a data-ref-id=\"3005-162\" href=\"/nathan-drake/3005-162/\" slug=\"nathan-drake\">Nathan Drake</a> territory. But with a solid supporting cast backing him up, it's hard to harp on the Will's Drake-like performance.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1234049-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_134.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234049\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1234049-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_134.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1234049\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1234049-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_134.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1234049-t_darkvoid_character_devdiary_doc_hd_134.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Your radar is absolutely key when dogfighting.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>There's a cohesive art style to Dark Void that makes it look different than the typical Unreal Engine-based shooter. For starters, there's a lot of open sky in the game, which makes Dark Void look a lot brighter than its name might lead you to believe. Also, the character models have a slightly exaggerated look to them that, when combined with a similar style of character animation, give the game's characters an interesting look. This especially helps the game's cutscenes, where Will and the other humans emote really well with their eyes. Between the dialogue and their body language, it's easy to see that there's history between Will and Ava, for example.<br/> <br/> The core elements in Dark Void are well-designed and fun to play, and it tells an interesting story while setting up a world that's developed enough to deserve a sequel. But with its technical problems and a lack of enemy variety, Dark Void starts to feel like the game is getting in the way of its own universe. It's worth seeing for its unique twists on third-person shooting, but you'll probably come away feeling like it could have been much more. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "Dark Void lays down a great foundation with its solid premise and characters, but the action is grounded by a handful of technical issues.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-253/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20703/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dark-void/3030-20703/", "id": 20703, "name": "Dark Void"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-01-19 00:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72500/", "id": 72500, "name": "Dark Void"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mass-effect-2-review/1900-254/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1249362-screenshot_076_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1249362\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1249362-screenshot_076_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1249362\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1249362-screenshot_076_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Shepard's got some tough new friends on his side. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure> The original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16909\" href=\"/mass-effect/3030-16909/\" slug=\"mass-effect\">  Mass Effect</a> should have been my favorite game ever. Here was a grand space opera from <a data-ref-id=\"3010-98\" href=\"/bioware/3010-98/\" slug=\"bioware\">  BioWare</a> in the epic role-playing tradition of the company's own <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18741\" href=\"/star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic/3030-18741/\" slug=\"star-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic\">  Knights of the Old Republic</a>. It had a stunningly broad and shiny new sci-fi universe that mixed the political intrigue of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-330\" href=\"/star-trek/3025-330/\" slug=\"star-trek\">  Star Trek</a> with the exotic aliens and quasi-mystical powers of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-551\" href=\"/star-wars/3025-551/\" slug=\"star-wars\">  Star Wars</a>. There was combat that promised to blend modern third-person shooting with stop-and-go squad tactics for the ultimate in space warfare. The game even paid not just attention but almost <i>reverence</i> to the finer details of physical cosmology and the practicalities of space travel. It was like someone at BioWare looked inside my head, assessed my interests, and assembled a game <i>especially for me</i>.<br/> <br/> But there was a disheartening counterpoint to every one of those great elements. The combat and RPG mechanics fell short of their potential with clunky controls, an overwhelming list of special abilities, and unwieldy inventory management. Outside of the fine storyline, the side missions and explorable planets were frustratingly repetitive and generic. An often embarrassing frame rate and constant, glaring texture pop-in bespoke a general lack of technical polish throughout the game. And don't even get me started on that <a data-ref-id=\"3055-250\" href=\"/m35-mako/3055-250/\" slug=\"m35-mako\">  Mako</a>. Mass Effect was anchored and propelled by the strength of its sprawling fiction, but in a lot of ways, it was a hard game to love.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8106/1249305-screenshot_089_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1249305\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8106/1249305-screenshot_089_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1249305\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8106/1249305-screenshot_089_o.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The combat is just a ton more fun than in the first game.</figcaption></figure><a data-ref-id=\"3030-21590\" href=\"/mass-effect-2/3030-21590/\" slug=\"mass-effect-2\">  Mass Effect 2</a> is, across the board, a dramatic improvement on every one of those failings. It also improves everything the first game did <i>right</i>. BioWare clearly took a hard look at each aspect of its original design and figured out what was worth salvaging and what should be jettisoned right out the airlock. The Mako? Gone. Inventory management? Non-existent. In their place is a more intelligently designed, streamlined, and polished mission that's thoroughly entertaining at every moment. Everything about the gameplay and mechanics has been stripped down to its necessary components and reassembled seamlessly into a game that's more impressive and enjoyable from top to bottom. It doesn't hurt that the story is both more interesting and presented more fluidly, as well.<br/> <br/>The game opens with a bang directly after the events of the first game, and quickly finds <a data-ref-id=\"3005-658\" href=\"/commander-shepard/3005-658/\" slug=\"commander-shepard\">  Commander Shepard</a> in very different (and much more dire) circumstances than he, or she, was involved in last time. If you've made it this far without finding out exactly what sort of situation Shepard is in, I might as well help preserve the surprise a little bit longer. Let it suffice that the predicament is grim, and you'll find yourself working for, and with, some far less savory and perhaps less <i>trustworthy</i> people than the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-26\" href=\"/the-citadel/3035-26/\" slug=\"the-citadel\"> Citadel</a> bureaucrats and special agents you're used to. The story gains momentum and intrigue from this fundamental shakeup, and you get a more colorful cast of characters to work with thanks to the relative lawlessness you're operating in. There's a breakneck pacing to working on the fringes of the galaxy, and of galactic society, that really grabbed me and pulled me right along for the ride.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1225268-17__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1225268\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56122448979592\" data-width=\"588\" style=\"width: 588px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1225268-17__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1225268\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1225268-17__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1225268-17__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Everything about the RPG mechanics is better in this sequel.</figcaption></figure>  But Mass Effect always had great characters and story. On the most-improved list, however, the combat sits right at the top. The basic movement, aiming, and shooting feel much tighter here, and I'll put them right up alongside any pure third-person shooter on the market. Honestly, I didn't know BioWare had it in them. But then, you've also got Mass Effect's list of extra combat components--wild biotic powers, ammo mods, tech hacks, and other special abilities--that add depth and variety above and beyond your garden-variety shooter.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>Like in the first game, you can still pause the action and dole out commands to your squad mates if you want. I was an unapologetic pauser last time around, but I almost never used that feature in this game, since you can now map a lot more of your and your allies' attacks directly to the controller buttons and D-pad, and you can also tell them where to move and what to attack. Thanks to the improved feel of the controls, the ability to pop off special abilities left and right at the touch of a button without interrupting the flow of the action, and a far more consistent and smoother frame rate, the combat here feels a hell of a lot faster-paced and more exciting than it did last time around. You may never want to pause it again, either.<br/> <br/> Longtime BioWare fans should know that Mass Effect 2 feels like less RPG and more shooter than its predecessor did--but they should also know that's explicitly a good thing. The unwieldy, top-heavy RPG mechanics that burdened the first game are gone, replaced by a streamlined system that removes the busywork from outfitting your characters and lets you just get on with your damn mission. Instead of throwing dozens of new weapons and armor suits at you, and forcing you to compare obscure stats between them to figure out which ones you should be using, the game reduces its arsenal to the bare essentials. And it's better for that simplicity.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8106/1249297-screenshot_093_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1249297\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8106/1249297-screenshot_093_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1249297\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8106/1249297-screenshot_093_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8106/1249297-screenshot_093_o.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0There are some real standout new characters. This guy is a lot funnier than he looks. \u00a0And he looks pretty funny. \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure>There are now only two or three weapons in each category, and they're separated more by qualitative differences (ammo capacity, automatic versus burst fire, accuracy) than numeric damage ratings, which aren't even exposed to the player. Likewise armor, which you collect piecemeal rather than as entire suits. Similar to the weapons, the armor pieces give you specific buffs (5 percent to health on some gauntlets, 10 to run speed with new boots, a reduction in shield recharge time with a new chest plate) rather than carrying generic defense values. You can mix and match these pieces as you see fit, and then customize the color scheme of your armor as a whole. All this business only applies to Shepard, since your party members don't even take new armor. Their combat progression relies solely on the abilities you upgrade for them on their skill trees, which are reduced in size from last time and a lot easier to wrap your head around.<br/> <br/> Don't mistake all this simplification for dumbing down. The role-playing elements that matter are still here, tied into your interactions with your ship's diverse crew and the galaxy's wild menagerie of alien beings. The brilliant in-line conversation wheel, probably the best thing about the first game, is back in effect, and you could spend hours and hours just chatting it up with every <a data-ref-id=\"3015-801\" href=\"/turian/3015-801/\" slug=\"turian\"> turian</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1582\" href=\"/asari/3015-1582/\" slug=\"asari\"> asari</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1302\" href=\"/elcor/3015-1302/\" slug=\"elcor\"> elcor</a> you encounter on each of a dozen primary worlds and space stations. The real stand-outs are the people on your own crew, though. The majority of the storyline consists of Shepard's attempts to recruit a crack team of experts to tackle his dire new mission, and that gives you a lot of time to get to know all of the new characters that come aboard the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-109\" href=\"/ssv-normandy/3055-109/\" slug=\"ssv-normandy\"> Normandy</a>.

I don't consider these missions optional at all, because they're just as well-produced as the quests in the main storyline and they add a considerable amount of depth and back story to both the relevant character and the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-560\" href=\"/mass-effect/3025-560/\" slug=\"mass-effect\"> Mass Effect</a> universe at large. Skipping these side quests in particular would rob you not only of a good dozen hours of gameplay but also much of the narrative texture that makes the game so hard to put down. The hours and hours of expertly written and acted dialogue you get from these quests and other interactions make these characters feel better realized than those in just about any other game I can think of.<br/> <br/> Even aside from those main side quests, there's plenty to keep you busy if you want to take a break from the storyline, and unlike last time, it's actually varied and interesting. There are scores of planets in the game to investigate--but the big difference is, you can't land on them if there's nothing fun to do there. You can scan those barren planets from orbit with a slightly tedious minigame to find rare elements that you can cash in for upgrades to your weapons and special abilities. When you do find a side mission to pick up, you take a shuttle straight down to the action instead of driving some ill-conceived ATV there. These missions are usually only 10 to 20 minutes long, but even they all feature unique maps and storylines, however brief. Some of them even chain into little two- or three-part quest lines of their own. There are dozens of hours of content packed into a single play-through here, and that's assuming you don't want to go back and play it again as a bad guy, or a female, or in some other way that differs from your initial run. The differences in player classes are significant enough that the combat will have a distinctively new feel when you play again, and the chance to carry over levels and other bonuses from a previous play-through further sweetens the deal.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8106/1240817-vanguard_02_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1240817\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/8106/1240817-vanguard_02_o.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1240817\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8106/1240817-vanguard_02_o.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/8106/1240817-vanguard_02_o.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0There's a huge range of ways to play your Shepard.</figcaption></figure>BioWare has been making a big deal about Mass Effect 2's save-import feature that lets you bring your own Shepard over from the first game. It turns out, all that hubbub was for good reason. The list of major and minor plot elements that change based on what you did in the first game is too long to recount here; in fact, it's so long that I was continually reminded of minor characters and decisions I'd met and made last time around and then promptly forgotten about, in addition to the more obvious cues like which party member I sent to their death on <a data-ref-id=\"3035-850\" href=\"/virmire/3035-850/\" slug=\"virmire\"> Virmire</a>, or whether I let <a data-ref-id=\"3005-699\" href=\"/urdnot-wrex/3005-699/\" slug=\"urdnot-wrex\">  Wrex</a> live or not. (Of course I did.) You can certainly play with a brand new character--the game gives you a clever, contextual way to define most of those major decisions that you missed out on--but you'll definitely get the most out of this sequel by bringing an established Shepard over, especially since you're free to change your class and appearance when you do. Similarly, this game wraps up with so much potential variation in its outcome that I'm having a hard time imagining how the designers can make a third game that accounts for all of the possibilities. But judging by the quality of this game, they'll find a way.<br/> <br/> Mass Effect started with a huge stable of good ideas. Maybe the task of executing on all those ideas was too great for any one development team to accomplish in a single game, but BioWare has really gotten it right the second time around. They took those same ideas and figured out a better way to combine them into a more cohesive, more playable sequel that makes good on every bit of Mass Effect's potential and leaves me staring very grudgingly at the presumable two-year wait until my own Commander Shepard can continue his fight in the next game.", "deck": "BioWare's big new sci-fi sequel presents a more seamless blend of action and role-playing that bests its predecessor in every conceivable way.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-254/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-21590/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/mass-effect-2/3030-21590/", "id": 21590, "name": "Mass Effect 2"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2010-01-27 19:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84232/", "id": 84232, "name": "Mass Effect 2"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/serious-sam-the-first-encounter-review/1900-255/", "description": "<p style=\"\"> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1211470-pcg209.rev_sam.kamikaze1__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1211470\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56122448979592\" data-width=\"588\" style=\"width: 588px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1211470-pcg209.rev_sam.kamikaze1__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1211470\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1211470-pcg209.rev_sam.kamikaze1__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0AAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHH</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">When it was originally released, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1079\" href=\"/serious-sam-the-second-encounter/3030-1079/\" slug=\"serious-sam-the-second-encounter\">               Serious Sam</a> was a throwback to an era and a style of game that never really existed, but should've. Intended as a response to the increasing complexity and sophistication of first-person shooters, Serious Sam took the lean, tense corridor-crawling and overwhelming monster encounters that defined early first-person shooters like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-7326\" href=\"/doom/3030-7326/\" slug=\"doom\">              Doom</a>, sped it up, and turned up the crazy. It made for an experience that suggested what all first-person shooters would be like if the genre had grown up in arcades instead of on the PC. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Now the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2438\" href=\"/mad-scientist/3015-2438/\" slug=\"mad-scientist\">             mad</a> eastern bloc <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2438\" href=\"/mad-scientist/3015-2438/\" slug=\"mad-scientist\">            scientists</a> at <a data-ref-id=\"3010-118\" href=\"/croteam-ltd/3010-118/\" slug=\"croteam-ltd\">           Croteam</a> have used their latest technology to remake Serious Sam: The First Encounter. Despite a higher resolution, cleaner textures, and better particle effects, the experience is, for all intents and purposes, unchanged. The passage of time makes it feel even more like an alternate history throwback than it did originally, but the relentless gameplay philosophy is just as singular and exhilarating as it was nearly a decade ago. <br/>\u00a0<br/>As a response to more, uh, serious games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2980\" href=\"/half-life/3030-2980/\" slug=\"half-life\">          Half-Life</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-13948\" href=\"/system-shock/3030-13948/\" slug=\"system-shock\">         System Shock</a>, there's a lot about Serious Sam that is intentionally very stupid, not least of which is the fiction. I'm not even going to explain it here, partially because it's not really relevant, and partially because I do not believe that even the developers at Croteam want you to care about backstory or character motivation. Their primary concerns are very apparently shooting and monsters, so all you really need to know is you're a dude that shoots monsters. Also, you're in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-369\" href=\"/ancient-egypt/3035-369/\" slug=\"ancient-egypt\">        Egypt</a>, kinda? Or at least an Egyptian-themed level in a videogame. <br/>\u00a0<br/>The setting seems designed specifically to remind you that you're playing a video game. The same thing goes for your weapon selection, which includes a grab-bag of <a data-ref-id=\"3055-59\" href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" slug=\"pistol\">       six-shooters</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">      shotguns</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-261\" href=\"/tommy-gun/3055-261/\" slug=\"tommy-gun\">     tommy guns</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">    rocket launchers</a>, and some exotic high-end firearms. While the weapons are archetypal, the monsters you face seem like they were each plucked from other, wildly different games. They're consistently absurd, though the headless screaming suicide bomber with big black Snidely Whiplash <a data-ref-id=\"3055-97\" href=\"/bomb/3055-97/\" slug=\"bomb\">   bombs</a> instead of hands remains the gold standard for awesomely ridiculous character design in this and all other games. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Structurally, Serious Sam couldn't be more straightforward. It's a long string of corridors and open arenas that fill up with monsters that you have to murder before you can move on to the next area. There is, on a very rare occasion, a button to press or some item to collect before you can progress, but the genius of Serious Sam lies in the quality of the shooting and the quantity of the monsters. Individually, most of the monsters in Serious Sam are extremely manageable, but you're almost never pitted against just one enemy, or even one <i>type</i>  of enemy. I'd say that different enemies and different combinations of enemies can require different strategies for success, but honestly, everything just moves so fast that there's no time for you to formulate strategies. No, situational awareness--a factor that hinges largely on the game's distinctive sound design--and the ability to circle-strafe backwards are the most significant keys to success in Serious Sam. <br/>\u00a0<br/></p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1211487-serioussamtfe_hd_2__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1211487\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56122448979592\" data-width=\"588\" style=\"width: 588px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1211487-serioussamtfe_hd_2__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1211487\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1211487-serioussamtfe_hd_2__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Just another typical day for Sam \"Serious\" Stone. </figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">And yet, no matter how good you are at dodging and shooting hordes of enemies, there's an underlying spite to the way Serious Sam is designed that will constantly keep you on the ropes. Monsters will <i>always</i> spawn at the most inopportune time, and if you see a big pile of health, armor, and ammo sitting all unassuming in the middle of a room, you can bet that you're going to be knee-deep in machine-gun-wielding scorpion guys and hairy cyclops monsters as soon as you approach it. There's some checkpointing, but the game's quick-save feature puts that responsibility primarily in the player's hand. It's telling that, in the Xbox Live Arcade version, the quick-save feature is mapped to the Y button by default for easy access. Obviously the PC version, with full mouse and keyboard support, is the ideal way to play Serious Sam HD, but the game still moves plenty fast on the 360, and an appropriate amount of auto-aiming assistance keeps the gamepad from being a significant liability. <br/>\u00a0<br/>I've got a whole lot of admiration for Serious Sam, yet it's a game that I enjoy in concept more than I do in practice. I love the deliberate left-field designs of the monsters, and there's a purity to the way it approaches first-person shooting action that I wouldn't want to change, yet the game is so brutally intense that my frayed nerves and trembling hands can only handle it in half-hour chunks at most. Maybe that's Serious Sam's fault, or maybe  <i>I'm</i> just not serious enough.</p>", "deck": "You'll be hard-pressed to find a purer, more panic-inducing FPS experience than Serious Sam.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-255/", "platforms": "PC, Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-27152/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/serious-sam-the-first-encounter/3030-27152/", "id": 27152, "name": "Serious Sam: The First Encounter"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-01-27 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-88325/", "id": 88325, "name": "Serious Sam: The First Encounter HD"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/mag-review/1900-256/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1044179-magpic6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044179\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.50485436893204\" data-width=\"618\" style=\"width: 618px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:50.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1044179-magpic6.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1044179\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4647/1044179-magpic6.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Welcome to MAG, where just about everything is either smoking or on fire.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>The big hook for <a data-ref-id=\"3010-313\" href=\"/sony-computer-entertainment-america/3010-313/\" slug=\"sony-computer-entertainment-america\">Sony</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21116\" href=\"/mag/3030-21116/\" slug=\"mag\">MAG</a> is that it supports up up to 256 players at once. That means that you and 127 of your closest friends can take on 128 of the Internet's finest in a first-person shooting extravaganza. While the game works as advertised, the higher player count doesn't end up creating a huge difference between MAG and other large-scale first-person shooters. But if you're looking to capture control points and gun down human opposition, the systems surrounding MAG are interesting enough to make this a worthwhile release.<br/> <br/> It's plastered all over the box, but it's worth repeating to make sure your expectations are set properly: MAG is a multiplayer-only shooter. Short of a brief and largely ineffective training session that shows you how to crouch and throw <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenades</a>, every other aspect of MAG puts you into battle against other human players. It all starts by forcing you to choose one of the game's three factions. In the end, the three factions are fairly interchangeable, but the game makes this decision seem like a huge deal. Once you've created a character and joined a faction, you'll have to reach the game's level cap to change sides. There's only one character slot, too, so if you want to try all three sides, you'll have to either create more PlayStation Network accounts or erase your existing character and start over. It's a good way to force you to feel some loyalty for your faction, but like most other things in MAG, the game doesn't give you enough information up front to feel like you're making a well-researched and reasoned decision.<br/> <br/> Once you've selected a faction and moved forward, you're given a set of preset weapon and equipment loadouts and offered the game's simplest game type, suppression. This is a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">team deathmatch</a> game for up to 64 players, and unlike the other modes, it's an in-faction match that pits members of the same faction against each other in what the universe justifies as a training exercise. With none of the objective elements and leadership bonuses that make MAG more strategic and only one map per faction, suppression matches are only useful for getting players used to the way MAG's guns feel.<br/> <br/> The other three match types increase the complexity and get more interesting. Sabotage is another 64-player match, and it's a basic control point battle with one team attacking and the other on defense. Even in this \"small\" match, things are broken up in a way that makes the game feel smaller than it is, as different squads are sent to different control points. The end, however, culminates in the full attacking team moving on a final control point. When you see 32 guys all trying to run into a tiny area and plant explosives, you finally get the full effect of MAG's scope. Weirdly enough, this 64-player match is really the only match that bunches players together like this, and it ends up feeling more chaotic and crazy than strategic and fun.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1425/963776-1__9_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-963776\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1425/963776-1__9_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-963776\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1425/963776-1__9_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Getting to an elevated position is usually a good idea.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Acquisition takes the player count up to 128, and puts one faction on the attack as they attempt to hijack two vehicles from enemy positions and drive them to specific capture positions. In this mode, you start to get a feel for the tactical side of MAG, as the various assets that the team leaders can use appear. Leaders can call in mortar strikes and sensor sweeps, but these abilities are dependent on keeping various structures, like mortar cannons and satellite arrays, up and running. The attacking team can plant explosives on these structures, but defenders with repair guns can always fix these stations to get the support powers back up and running. Acquisition feels chaotic, but it also feels more open than the other modes. In most of these matches, I felt totally lost, and would go minutes without even seeing the opposition as I worked my way across the map to where the vehicles are kept. Perhaps bad leadership is to blame here, but I was happy to open up the game's final mode.<br/> <br/> Domination is the only mode where you'll get a full 256 players in game. It offers the largest command structure and the most objectives, but it rarely feels more populated than sabotage games. While you'll have 128 players on a team, the size of the map means that the different squads are spread around the battle, attacking or defending different positions. So even though the game will look different to players in leadership positions, the actual action doesn't feel much different than the control point gameplay of a 64-player sabotage match. At most, your squad will have two control points (of eight) to worry about. Still, these matches can last up to 30 minutes and are the best thing about MAG.<br/> <br/> Player progression is a big deal in MAG. You can build five different custom loadouts for your soldier using assault rifles, machine guns, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-67\" href=\"/sniper-rifle/3055-67/\" slug=\"sniper-rifle\">sniper rifles</a> as primary weapons. You can also carry secondary gear like medic guns that heal or resurrect injured players, repair guns for fixing battlefield assets, grenades, an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">RPG</a>, and so on. Weapons can be further customized with different scopes, reduced recoil, and so on. The catch is that you'll have to unlock all of these different items using skill points, which are doled out as you gain experience and rise in level. So if you want to carry a better assault rifle, you'll need to spend three skill points to get it. The skill list is also tiered, so you'll have to spend points on lesser upgrades before getting to the good stuff. A respec meter fills as you play, so if you eventually realize that you've misspent all of your skill points, there are ways to fix mistakes.<br/> <br/> Each piece of gear you unlock with skill points has a credit amount associated with it, and your custom loadouts have to come in under a certain total. This prevents players from creating super-classes that have, for example, both the best medical gun and a repair kit unless you're willing to sacrifice in other areas.<br/> <br/> Once you hit level eight, you can start participating in every mode of play, but you'll have to get to level 15 before you can apply for any of the game's leadership roles. The basic leader position is squad leader, putting you in charge of an eight-man crew. Leaders assign objectives to the squad, and the members of your square are incentivized to follow your orders because they'll get an experience point bonus for performing tasks in the vicinity of the thing you're telling them to attack or defend. Leaders also get access to additional abilities, like the ability to call in <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3350\" href=\"/unmanned-aerial-vehicle/3055-3350/\" slug=\"unmanned-aerial-vehicle\">UAV</a>s for better battlefield awareness, air strikes, and so on. All of these abilities are activated via the D-pad, and it's easy to manage these while still playing an active role on the battlefield.\u00a0As you lead, you'll earn leadership points that eventually qualify you for meatier positions, all the way up to Officer-in-Charge, which gives you a form of control over the entire 128-man team. Leaders can get into different channels of communication to set up higher-level strategies, but with the way most of the maps are broken up, there's a natural progression to the action that doesn't really require a lot of hands-on management. Leaders also have radius effects that improve the skills of players that stand near them. For the average player, though, all of this leadership boils down to a pulsating objective on the map and a line of text in the upper-left corner that tells you where to go and what to do when you get there. Voice chat doesn't feel especially vital to the experience.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2014/947040-3409711805_04a30ecaab_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-947040\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2014/947040-3409711805_04a30ecaab_b.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-947040\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2014/947040-3409711805_04a30ecaab_b.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2014/947040-3409711805_04a30ecaab_b.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The weapons in MAG are powerful, so either wear the heavy armor or keep your head down.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>Players go down easily in MAG. Unless you're wearing the heavy armor (or rocking a skill upgrade that gives you more health), you'll only take a few shots before dropping to the ground. This makes the guns feel pretty powerful and makes the shooting satisfying. Also, it slows the pace of the action a bit. If you're running around corners, chances are you're going to get gunned down by someone smart enough to crouch, hide, and take careful shots. Of course, headshots are a different story, and between the large size of the game's maps and the way the game offers plenty of rooftops and other elevated positions, you can expect snipers to make a heavy impact on the action.<br/> <br/> Visually, MAG has its moments, but parts of it look a little weird. The action maintains a smooth frame rate, but the environments look a little bland and the colors seem muted. Effects, like fire and explosions, have a blocky, pixelated look. The individual soliders look fine, and you'll unlock plenty of cosmetic upgrades for your loadouts, like hats, goggles, and color schemes. The audio is OK, but fairly unmemorable in the grand scheme of things. Considering you'll probably want to use a headset while playing, it's fine that the gunfire and other effects don't stand out.<br/> <br/> MAG is a solid shooter and its leadership elements are intelligently designed, but it doesn't feel especially different from other big-team consoles shooters, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20655\" href=\"/battlefield-bad-company/3030-20655/\" slug=\"battlefield-bad-company\">Battlefield: Bad Company</a>.

No More Heroes 2 shares this spirit with its predecessor, though it's learned a few things in the interim, sanding down some of the less aerodynamic parts and replacing them with even more attitude. At a certain point the three-chord structure can wear a little thin even for those that are in on the joke, but sometimes you just need something loud, passionate, and crazy to cleanse the palette.<br/><br/>Following in the footsteps of other unnecessary sequels before it, No More Heroes 2 basically pushes the reset button on our hero, the self-made assassin <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1019\" href=\"/travis-touchdown/3005-1019/\" slug=\"travis-touchdown\">             Travis Touchdown</a>, ginning up a new excuse for him to break out his trusty <a data-ref-id=\"3055-365\" href=\"/beam-sword/3055-365/\" slug=\"beam-sword\">       beam katana</a> and murder his way to the top of the United Assassins Association ranks with the help of his cold and presumably duplicitous agent <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1036\" href=\"/sylvia-christel/3005-1036/\" slug=\"sylvia-christel\">            Sylvia</a>. The game actually maintains continuity with the first game, featuring a number of returning characters and unresolved story threads, though it correctly assumes that, if the person holding the controller didn't play the first game, it's a waste of time to try and explain what the hell is going on. This is a game where, if it'll save time, a character will plainly state that video-game players don't care about backstory, implicating the player with a glance towards the camera. <br/><br/>So his reasons for the unmitigated bloodshed are a little more personal this time around, but the overall structure of Travis Touchdown's mission remains the same, pushing his way through deliberately chunky and garish environments filled with cannon fodder before facing off with the next ranked assassin in an over-the-top boss battle. Your first fight is against a hip-hop-label-owner-turned-cult-leader with a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2836\" href=\"/scottish-accent/3015-2836/\" slug=\"scottish-accent\">           Scottish accent</a> and robotic arms that turn into a deadly boombox.

A Classic Controller option has been added, which is great for players with motion-control allergies, and it clearly points to the series' future on platforms other than the Wii. I actually found that I ever-so-slightly preferred the little visceral flair that the occasional curt gesture adds to the action, though I also find that the Classic Controller feels a little cramped in my hands. Oh, also, you can now randomly, and inexplicably, turn into a man-eating tiger, making you invincible and giving you one-hit kills for a short time. There is literally no justifiable reason for Grasshopper to add this to No More Heroes 2, other than they probably thought it would be awesome. Turns out, it totally is.<br/><br/>No More Heroes 2 aims higher with its outlandish boss battles than the first game did, though it eases up on the overall difficulty, making health items more plentiful and boss fights a little less drawn out. There are some structural improvements as well. Gone is the crappy open-world navigation of the first game, replaced with a simple map of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-21\" href=\"/santa-destroy/3035-21/\" slug=\"santa-destroy\">        Santa Destroy</a>, significantly cutting down on the downtime between activities. You also don't have to pay any exorbitant entry fees to enter a ranking fight, leaving you with more money to spend on training, upgraded beam katanas, and random hipster t-shirts. Money will still, hilariously, fly out of enemies, though you'll need to take on some side jobs to earn some real scratch, all of which are rendered in the style of old 8-bit console games. These games aren't so much  <i>good</i> as they are  <i>accurate</i>, right down to the crushed and muddled digital voice samples. It only takes a couple plays for most of these side jobs to turn tedious, but they make up for it with volume, and it's impressive how they nail the era and the styles of games they're trying to emulate.<br/><br/>This 8-bit design style bleeds out into the rest of the game in random spots, often in the form of square-wave audio cues and anachronistic fonts, though it takes equal inspiration from giant robot cartoons, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-332\" href=\"/lucha-libre/3015-332/\" slug=\"lucha-libre\">      lucha libre</a>, anime cheesecake, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1016\" href=\"/spaghetti/3055-1016/\" slug=\"spaghetti\">     spaghetti</a> <a data-ref-id=\"3035-826\" href=\"/wild-west/3035-826/\" slug=\"wild-west\">    westerns</a>. No More Heroes 2 is clearly less interested in creating an immersive world than it is a ridiculous playground for its protagonist to murder dudes in, which can make it a very spartan-looking game at times, a sense that's exacerbated by the game's high-contrast art style.<br/><br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1236676-t_nomh2ds_henry_30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1236676\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1236676-t_nomh2ds_henry_30.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1236676\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1236676-t_nomh2ds_henry_30.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1236676-t_nomh2ds_henry_30.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0I couldn't explain what's going on here if I wanted to.</figcaption></figure>  No More Heroes 2 remains propelled by its own bratty enthusiasm for the good first half of its run-time, though it does start to run out of steam somewhat as it approaches the grand finale. There are some sequences where you play as characters other than Travis Touchdown that suffer from ill-conceived controls. And while I said it's generally an easier game than the first, the boss fights can still slide into drawn-out battles of attrition, which can be tedious to win and frustrating to lose. There are significant performance issues as well--despite the fact that most of the game consists of Travis fighting a half-dozen dudes and little more, the frame rate can get real sketchy at times. <br/><br/>In more ways than one, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1091\" href=\"/no-more-heroes/3025-1091/\" slug=\"no-more-heroes\">   No More Heroes</a> is to games what  <i>Crank</i> is the movies--this is a deliberately stupid and absurd game made with incredible craft and passion by people who love video games and hate being bored.

At the beginning of the game, you knew next to nothing about the nature of your own character, let alone the underwater Utopia-gone-wrong called <a data-ref-id=\"3035-66\" href=\"/rapture/3035-66/\" slug=\"rapture\">  Rapture</a>. The city was more of a star than any of the characters living in it, and around every corner you'd find an audio log or some piece of art deco architecture that filled in a little bit more of the puzzle. The catch was that actually <i>playing</i> BioShock was far less interesting than watching its story unfold. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20827\" href=\"/bioshock-2/3030-20827/\" slug=\"bioshock-2\">  BioShock 2</a> addresses a lot of the gameplay issues from the first game, with more fulfilling combat and abilities. But the story feels more like a footnote to the events of the first game, making it best suited to superfans who can live with just a little bit more insight into what made Rapture tick.<br/> <br/>     BioShock 2's story is set around ten years after the events of the first game, and you play as a character that is usually referred to as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11413\" href=\"/subject-delta/3005-11413/\" slug=\"subject-delta\">  Subject Delta</a>. Delta is an advanced <a data-ref-id=\"3015-624\" href=\"/big-daddy/3015-624/\" slug=\"big-daddy\">  Big Daddy</a> prototype, so you'll spend the game stomping around in a big suit with a large drill that serves as your melee weapon. Unlike the typical Daddies, Delta has free will, but he's also been bound to a specific <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1111\" href=\"/little-sisters/3015-1111/\" slug=\"little-sisters\">  Little Sister</a>, and if they remain apart for too long, Delta shuts down into a comatose state. So the game is a quest to get your (now grown) Little Sister back. But it just so happens that your Little Sister is <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13897\" href=\"/eleanor-lamb/3005-13897/\" slug=\"eleanor-lamb\">  Eleanor Lamb</a>, daughter of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12998\" href=\"/sofia-lamb/3005-12998/\" slug=\"sofia-lamb\">  Sofia Lamb</a>, who's now in charge of Rapture. The elder Lamb has restarted the Little Sister project and is collecting ADAM to satisfy her own warped philosophical slant. You being alive is enough to throw a big monkey wrench into her plans, so you'll naturally have a fight on your hands.<br/> <br/>     Thankfully, you'll be able to use both of your hands at the same time during that fight. Dual-wielding <a data-ref-id=\"3055-24\" href=\"/plasmid/3055-24/\" slug=\"plasmid\">  plasmids</a> and firearms is one of the most noticeable improvements to the way BioShock 2 plays. Both types of weapons are are made more useful by the way you can fire them off one after the other. It makes for a faster-paced game, overall. Also, the firearms in BioShock 2 are much better. You'll start out with a simple rivet gun, but you'll eventually collect a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">  shotgun</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-608\" href=\"/machine-gun/3055-608/\" slug=\"machine-gun\">  machine gun</a>, a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-252\" href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252/\" slug=\"grenade-launcher\">  grenade launcher</a>, and so on. The weapons feel more accurate and damaging than the guns in the first game. Back then, I was content to play through most of the game using the wrench, since the weapons felt less effective than just running up and whacking your foes. In BioShock 2, the weapons and their upgrades make them a lot more fun to use than the default drill, which requires fuel and doesn't feel nearly as deadly as stabbing someone with a huge, spinning drill probably should. Hacking, which lets you use turrets and security bots as extra defense and can lower prices at vending machines, has been overhauled in a way that takes less time to complete. Research is now done via a video camera concept where you get more research points for filming enemies being attacked in a variety of ways. Both systems are better than their counterparts in the previous game.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2445/1225549-bs5_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1225549\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56171875\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2445/1225549-bs5_copy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1225549\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2445/1225549-bs5_copy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>  \u00a0\u00a0Even after a decade, there are still plenty of drugged-up crazies to murder in Rapture.</figcaption></figure>      Many plasmids from the first game return, but those can also be upgraded for charged-up effects. Charging up a higher-level shot of ice from the Winter Blast plasmid freezes enemies in a block of ice, making them much easier to shatter. You can, again, also slot tonics that grant you passive effects, such as making your plasmid use require less of the mana-like EVE that powers them, reducing the amount of damage you take, or even allowing you to slowly regain health and EVE by standing in water. As before, you can change up the plasmids and tonics you're using pretty frequently, and there are enough different options for both that you can customize Delta around the way you play the game.<br/> <br/>     All of this combat takes place in areas of Rapture that didn't appear in the first game, but the same look and feel is maintained. The biggest change is that these older sections of the city were served by a train line. This is used to justify the linear nature of BioShock 2. Most of your tasks involve getting the train to a new area, where it's blocked, so you'll have to get off and clear a path to continue. Once you move to the next level, there's no going back, so you'll have to deal with the Little Sisters you see immediately, rather than backtracking to find them later. While this is different than the first BioShock, it's not a major change.<br/> <br/>     Most of your goals are plainly laid-out and very straightforward, like \"get the key\" or \"flip the switch.\" But along the way, you'll encounter Little Sisters, who skip around the city, sucking ADAM out of corpses with a comically oversized syringe. In order to collect the ADAM you'll need to purchase more plasmids and tonics, you'll want to deal with every Little Sister you see. The process is a bit more involved than it was in the previous game, though as before, it starts with you defeating the Big Daddy that protects her. Once she's unescorted, you can \"adopt\" the Sister and put her up on your shoulder (which, since this is a first-person game, you never actually see). You can then take the sister to specific corpses and let her harvest ADAM from them. But once you set her down, splicers come out of the woodwork and attempt to get your little girl. You'll need to protect her while she works, which makes your ability to set a few different types of traps come in handy. There are also tonics that make the Sister work faster, which I found extremely helpful as staying alive while being swarmed by enemies makes the gathering process the hardest part of the entire game. After two gathering sessions, you can take the Sister to one of the many vent holes around Rapture, release her from her curse by turning her back into a regular little girl, and send her on her way. Or, at any point in this process, you can just hit the \"harvest\" button and kill her for her ADAM. Keeping them alive and healing them gives you some bonus tonics that really come in handy, and after completing every gathering session and saving every Sister, I was left with more ADAM than I knew what to do with by the end of the game.<br/> <br/>     The other substantial obstacle in BioShock 2 is the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4453\" href=\"/big-sister/3015-4453/\" slug=\"big-sister\">  Big Sister</a>. These are grown-up Little Sisters who wear something resembling Big Daddy armor, and one attacks as soon as you've dealt with every girl in a level. Though new enemies like the Brute <a data-ref-id=\"3015-647\" href=\"/splicers/3015-647/\" slug=\"splicers\">  Splicer</a> are tricky, the Big Sister, with her fast attacks and plasmid abilities, is the single toughest foe in Rapture. It's also the closest that the game ever gets to a boss fight.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2445/1225547-bs3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1225547\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56171875\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2445/1225547-bs3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1225547\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2445/1225547-bs3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2445/1225547-bs3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> \u00a0\u00a0The amusement park has some pretty funny Ryan-inspired moments.</figcaption></figure>      While BioShock 2 is more fun to play than its predecessor, a lot of the thrills that came from simply exploring Rapture and listening to audio logs come up short in the sequel. Sofia Lamb's reasons for running Rapture are fine fodder for Delta's adventure, but many of the game's audio logs feel like they're trying to find different ways to cram Lamb into the history of Rapture. You'll find audio logs from <a data-ref-id=\"3005-424\" href=\"/andrew-ryan/3005-424/\" slug=\"andrew-ryan\">  Andrew Ryan</a>, complaining about Lamb's psychiatric practice or debating her in public. You'll find logs from Lamb and other characters talking about her as the main threat to Ryan's power, as if <a data-ref-id=\"3005-925\" href=\"/atlas/3005-925/\" slug=\"atlas\">  Frank \"Atlas\" Fontaine</a> never existed. Lamb feels shoehorned into Rapture, making the game's events feel very disconnected from the happenings of the first game. The little bits and pieces of Andrew Ryan you get in BioShock 2 end up being the most satisfying things about its story, even if the events of the first game don't always feel like they're being handled with care.<br/> <br/>     Considering that both games in the BioShock series sort of live and die by their stories, online multiplayer doesn't immediately spring to mind as an obvious area of improvement for the series. So it's surprising that the game's multiplayer take on Rapture ends up being so much fun. Most of the structure of the multiplayer isn't earth-shattering, as it uses the persistent leveling system popularized by <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1258\" href=\"/modern-warfare/3025-1258/\" slug=\"modern-warfare\">  Modern Warfare</a> and inserts you into game types that are fancy, Rapture-themed ways to say \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">  team deathmatch</a>\" or \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-25\" href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" slug=\"capture-the-flag\">  capture the flag</a>,\" among others. But everything's been given just enough of a BioShock-themed twist to make it all work. You'll be able to hack turrets to fight for your team, or hack vending machines to spit out a bomb if an enemy player gets too close. Big Daddy suits occasionally spawn in the level, letting players don the armor and gain some powerful (though temporary) new abilities. When standing over a dead enemy, you can whip out your camera and take some research photos for a damage bonus against that player. Plus, the effective combination of plasmids and conventional weapons makes for a good time.<br/> <br/>     The multiplayer is set during the fall of Rapture, when Atlas and Ryan were effectively at war. As such, the city isn't quite so torn up on the multiplayer maps, most of which are based on locations from the first game, such as <a data-ref-id=\"3035-947\" href=\"/fort-frolic/3035-947/\" slug=\"fort-frolic\">  Fort Frolic</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1227\" href=\"/hephaestus/3035-1227/\" slug=\"hephaestus\">  Hephaestus</a>. Configuring your loadouts and unlocking additional tonics--many of which are custom-built for the multiplayer mode--also gives you a great deal of flexibility when it comes to building around your play style. The multiplayer is a surprisingly strong addition to the package that definitely earns its keep, even if it doesn't get quite as deep as some of the other popular shooters out there. Heck, it's nice to see a good, competent multiplayer shooter that doesn't involve real-world military conflicts or space marines.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182222\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1182222\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1182222-emperorhands.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption> \u00a0The multiplayer mode takes BioShock in a fun new direction.</figcaption></figure>      The sights and sounds of Rapture are mostly terrific. The audio logs and actual face-to-face encounters with humans are well-voiced, and there are little things with the sound design--like the way that leaking water will ping off of your helmet--that help immerse you in the world. Visually, the game is sharper than its predecessor and better at making Rapture look dirty, though there are plenty of walls and other textured surfaces that look bad up close. It's recommended that 360 users install the game to their hard drives to minimize that telltale texture popping that surfaces in so many <a data-ref-id=\"3015-86\" href=\"/unreal-engine-3/3015-86/\" slug=\"unreal-engine-3\">  Unreal Engine</a>\u00a0games these days.<br/> <br/>     It's hard to make too many direct comparisons to the first BioShock when talking about this sequel, because such a big part of the first game was seeing Rapture for the first time and experiencing a real sense of discovery as you went deeper and deeper into its fiction. Returning to Rapture--even a different part of the city--is naturally going to be less impressive. But the smart additions on the gameplay side make BioShock 2 rewarding in a different way, while those who want to know more about Andrew Ryan's underwater city will find just enough to make the return trip worthwhile.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><i>Disclosure: The game featured in this review is or was an advertised product on giantbomb.com.</i><i> </i><i>\u00a0</i>", "deck": "While the story doesn't always hit as hard as its predecessor, there are plenty of great gameplay changes that make BioShock 2 a worthwhile experience.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-258/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20827/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/bioshock-2/3030-20827/", "id": 20827, "name": "BioShock 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-02-08 09:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84051/", "id": 84051, "name": "BioShock 2"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/tomena-sanner-review/1900-259/", "description": "<br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1265773-tomena_sanner_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1265773\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1265773-tomena_sanner_13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1265773\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4647/1265773-tomena_sanner_13.jpg\"></a><figcaption> Dances With Robots.\u00a0</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27399\" href=\"/tomena-sanner/3030-27399/\" slug=\"tomena-sanner\">Tomena Sanner</a> is a \"one-button wai wai action game\" from Konami for <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2695\" href=\"/wiiware/3015-2695/\" slug=\"wiiware\">WiiWare</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3045-96\" href=\"/iphone/3045-96/\" slug=\"iphone\">iPhone</a>. Not that it really matters, but my cursory (and probably incorrect) search engine work defines \"wai wai\" as something lively, like the sound of children playing. It's not an entirely bankrupt description, as the biggest thing this timing-based rhythmic-but-not-really platformer-type-thing has going for it is its lively and kind of crazy nature. But tapping a button (or your phone's screen) to make a guy jump over stuff isn't exactly rocket-science, and once you've seen all of the goofy animations that Tomena Sanner contains, you'll probably never play it again.<br/> <br/>   Of course, for a game that's five bucks on WiiWare and $1.99 on the iPhone app store, the 30-ish minutes you'll spend seeing all nine of its levels isn't the worst deal in the world. The game puts you in the role of a suited-up businessman who runs to the right. As he encounters obstacles, you need to act--by pressing the A button on a Wii Remote or simply tapping the screen on your phone--to get your guy to jump. You'll need to properly time your presses to get the jumps down right, and the timing varies depending on what you're attempting to get over. While music plays the entire time, the game only feels loosely rhythmic, and I oftentimes felt like I was looking for timing cues that don't exist. If you get the timing correct, it's \"great.\" A looser press will net you a \"good\" while getting too far outside the timing window counts as a miss. A timer constantly ticks down as you play, and getting great timing gives you a bit of extra time, so you'll need to do well if you want to make it to the end of a level.<br/> <br/>   That sounds simple and, actually, it sounds pretty stupid. But the hook is in the animations that roll out as you deal with the obstacles. You'll head-butt monks, falling over if you miss or knocking him silly if you time it properly. You'll dance with schoolgirls in large, choreographed sequences. You'll launch robots into space, slide down staircase rails in a crane stance, and kick cowgirls in the face as you work your way through the game. It's extremely goofy, and it's all just weird enough to work, for a time.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1265772-tomena_sanner_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1265772\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"640\" style=\"width: 640px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4647/1265772-tomena_sanner_12.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1265772\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4647/1265772-tomena_sanner_12.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Dances With Schoolgirls.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>  The Wii version of the game goes the extra mile by putting more characters on screen in some spots.

The franchise's class-based take on multiplayer combat still elicits a few thrilling moments, but the three single-player campaigns aren't any fun at all.<br/> <br/>   Aliens vs. Predator is all about the differences between the three playable factions. The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1254\" href=\"/space-marine/3015-1254/\" slug=\"space-marine\">Marines</a> carry weapons, like the iconic <i>Aliens</i>\u00a0pulse rifle and even more iconic <i>Aliens</i> motion detector, which blips out frequently enough to let you know that something's moving out there, but not often enough to serve as a direct map to your enemies. The <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4530\" href=\"/xenomorph/3015-4530/\" slug=\"xenomorph\">aliens</a> are a purely melee class that can crawl on walls, see well in the dark, and detect silhouettes of enemies through solid surfaces. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4507\" href=\"/predator/3015-4507/\" slug=\"predator\">Predators</a> can cloak themselves, get two vision modes to help them see the other races, and are largely a melee class as well. But they can collect and use specific Predator weapons as they hunt. These weapons end up being especially devastating, but they're kept in check by low fire-rates and a finite amount of energy for your beam weapons.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17009/1245612-avp1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1245612\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17009/1245612-avp1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1245612\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17009/1245612-avp1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0\u00a0A big part of the Alien campaign involves putting Facehuggers onto faces.</figcaption></figure>       So with two classes relying heavily on strikes, that melee combat needs to be pretty good for the game to work. But it doesn't fit with the action especially well, and the end result is a rock-paper-scissors-like system of strikes, blocking, and counters that feels out-of-place in the game's fiction and also isn't much fun to perform. The aliens end up feeling especially weak. These things are bred to rip out the throats of the opposition and claw them apart in the process. Standing still, holding down the block controls and waiting for your enemy to strike so you can counter just feels silly. These mechanics do, however, make AVP feel very different than your average first-person shooter, which is a nice reprieve from the standard rifle/shotgun/sniper/rockets gameplay that you've come to expect from the typical sci-fi first-person shooter. The game offers a variety of different multiplayer modes, too, but on the 360 version, it was often hard to find players. You may have to wait around for five or 10 minutes before collecting enough players to get a game started.<br/> <br/>   Of course, that doesn't forgive the game's single-player portion, which drags you through the same dull events from three different perspectives. At best, the instruction you get on the use of your class's tools makes it a passable tutorial for the multiplayer. At its worst, though, AVP contains multiple scripting bugs where things that were supposed to happen simply didn't, forcing me to restart at the most recent checkpoint and hope that the game would carry forward. Also, the AI can't pilot an alien very well at all, like it can't deal with the concept of running up walls. If there's a pillar between you and an alien, it'll run up the side of it and start twitching and spinning around. It gets its bearings after a few seconds, but it looks pretty terrible. It'll take around six or seven hours to work through all three campaigns on the default difficulty setting, but they're not really worth seeing through to their conclusions.<br/> <br/>   That's really the largest problem with Aliens vs. Predator. There's no one solid aspect of it to make up for the other, busted-up parts. You're left with the impression that the single-player was an afterthought and that multiplayer was the focus.

Though, it also seems like part of the joke that an included easter egg even lets you play this episode with the trademark unwieldy fixed camera angle that helped define the series in the first place.<br/> <br/> Lost in Nightmares is set during a flashback you saw during Resident Evil 5, when a still-brunette\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3005-626\" href=\"/jill-valentine/3005-626/\" slug=\"jill-valentine\">Valentine</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-413\" href=\"/chris-redfield/3005-413/\" slug=\"chris-redfield\">Chris Redfield</a> assault the cliffside mansion of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-204\" href=\"/umbrella-corporation/3015-204/\" slug=\"umbrella-corporation\">Umbrella Corp.</a> founder <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10018\" href=\"/ozwell-e-spencer/3005-10018/\" slug=\"ozwell-e-spencer\">Ozwell Spencer</a>, before Jill and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-627\" href=\"/albert-wesker/3005-627/\" slug=\"albert-wesker\">Wesker</a> end up tumbling out a window and over the side of the cliff.

Then you fight Wesker. Then it's over! It's worth noting that your character progress from Resident Evil 5 proper has no bearing on what goes on in this flashback. Nor is there even a save system, which initially struck me as ridiculous. But the episode is so short you really don't need one, especially on subsequent playthroughs when you know where everything is.<br/> <br/> There <i>is</i> a short list of new achievements to gain, including 18 S.T.A.R.S. emblems to hunt down. You can also unlock Jill as a playable character (when playing single-player) and Professional difficulty level (best suited for co-op). Actually, you should always play this thing in co-op, since there are a couple of spots where your AI partner might get themselves killed, sending you back to the last checkpoint.

Heavy Rain's plot unfolds from the perspective of four loosely connected, archetypal characters: the despondent, down-on-his-luck single dad <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12115\" href=\"/ethan-mars/3005-12115/\" slug=\"ethan-mars\">   Ethan Mars</a>, already reeling from the loss of one child and the separation from his wife; overweight, alcoholic private eye <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12114\" href=\"/scott-shelby/3005-12114/\" slug=\"scott-shelby\">   Scott Shelby</a>; <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11856\" href=\"/madison-paige/3005-11856/\" slug=\"madison-paige\">   Madison Paige</a>, the feisty newspaper reporter who will stop at nothing to get the story; and the out-of-town FBI profiler <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11660\" href=\"/norman-jayden/3005-11660/\" slug=\"norman-jayden\">   Norman Jayden</a>, who predictably creates plenty of friction by grinding up against the internal politics of the local PD.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1281446-nathaniel_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1281446\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1281446-nathaniel_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1281446\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1281446-nathaniel_05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Great cinematic presentation underpins every scene. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure>    For reasons personal, professional, or both, they're all connected to the Origami Killer, the enigmatic psycho who's been murdering children in the area for the last two years. None of these four characters are particularly happy people, but you can't help getting attached to them as their paths cross and converge in pursuit of the murderer. The flow of the plot is broken up into brief scenes starring one or more of these primary characters along with all manner of supporting cast, and it's only an hour or two before you start to see enough connections between people and events, and the story picks up the momentum to propel you rapidly from one scene to the next. You could probably finish the game in two or three sittings once it gets its hooks in you and starts to drag you along.<br/> <br/> Even if the broader story succeeds at drawing you in, I found the smaller, personal interactions to be uneven. Plenty of the individual scenes convey honest dramatic heft, but some of them feel awkward or forced, as if you're watching automatons going through their preset paces rather than breathing human beings acting through their own agency. When a child willfully breaks away from his father in a crowded shopping mall, you just know something bad is going to happen to him, even when your character gets close enough to grab and stop him. When two characters lean in for a kiss, you can't necessarily see a romantic spark forming from their rigid facial expressions and lack of romantic preamble. And while most of the voiceover is perfectly serviceable and even quite affecting at times, some of the pronunciations and phrasings don't sound entirely American, though its characters are.<br/>\u00a0<br/>This is getting into serious nitpicking, because Heavy Rain achieves a level of believable human drama most games can only aspire to. And it's probably too soon to expect every synthetic character to match the lifelike precision of the ones in <i>Avatar. </i>But the occasional awkwardness here made me ponder the idea that the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-131\" href=\"/uncanny-valley/3015-131/\" slug=\"uncanny-valley\">   uncanny valley</a> encompasses more than simple skin shaders and eye movements. Maybe it extends around the things people say to each other and the reasons they do things, too. But at any rate, it's a sign of the story's overall strength that the game engages and sticks with you in spite of its rougher moments.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1277431-t_heavyra_vr_gt_hd_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1277431\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1277431-t_heavyra_vr_gt_hd_018.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1277431\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1277431-t_heavyra_vr_gt_hd_018.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1277431-t_heavyra_vr_gt_hd_018.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The game doesn't shy away from mature imagery and subject matter. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure>    Enough about watching the game; how do you play it, and how does playing it contribute to its story? Your interaction with the grimy world of Heavy Rain is limited to walking around in it (most of the time) and using combinations of buttons, analog stick movements, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-474\" href=\"/motion-control/3015-474/\" slug=\"motion-control\">   Sixaxis gestures</a> when prompted to perform context-relevant actions. These range from mundane (slowly pushing the stick downward to drag a razor across a character's face) to frantic (holding down five separate buttons in sequence to loosen a rope binding your wrists while the car you're tied up in is lowered into a junkyard crusher). There's a mostly satisfying, tactile feel to the way Heavy Rain makes you perform controller actions that look and feel like they map directly to what your character is doing onscreen. It's the sort of thing you need to experience firsthand to fully appreciate, but it generally works.<br/> <br/> The first question that occurred to me early on in Heavy Rain was, Why am I doing this stuff? What's the point of making a character brush his teeth, urinate, or open the fridge to get a snack? It was around the time I piloted Ethan over to that fridge that I think I hit on the answer. Presented with the choice between drinking a beer or a carton of orange juice, I performed the analog stick action to pick up the beer. Then I was confronted with another action to make him actually drink the beer. I stared at it for a couple of seconds, then put the beer back down, and drank the OJ instead. Then I thought, maybe Ethan stopped to consider his distant, emotionally fragile young son sitting in the other room and thought better of drinking around him. Then I wondered: Did I just contribute to the development of this character in some tiny way through my own actions? I'd like to think I did. It was a strangely empowering moment, even if it was accidental.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1281269-kickoff_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1281269\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1281269-kickoff_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1281269\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1281269-kickoff_05.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1281269-kickoff_05.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Everybody's got a reason to catch this killer.</figcaption></figure>    There are a couple of other things Heavy Rain does better than any game I can remember. One of them is <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">   quick time events</a>. You participate in every one of the game's frantic scenarios--be it a fistfight, a police chase, or escaping from a burning building--by quickly hitting buttons when prompted. But unlike, say, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20461\" href=\"/god-of-war-iii/3030-20461/\" slug=\"god-of-war-iii\">   God of War</a>, in which you fail and have to start over a canned animation when you miss a button, Heavy Rain's action scenes unfold seamlessly according to not only what you <i>do</i> but also what you <i>don't</i> do. Realistically, every character isn't going to escape from a car sinking into a river, or evade an axe-wielding maniac long enough to survive. When you miss a button press, your character exhibits a similarly inept action onscreen, so the course of the action sequence feels like it's being written as you play through it. The game conveys these failures fluidly and convincingly, and I was on the edge of my seat as I scrambled to try to make it through every one of them.<br/> <br/> The other is that often ballyhooed but rarely successful back-of-box feature, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-93\" href=\"/moral-decisions/3015-93/\" slug=\"moral-decisions\">   moral choice</a>. The game foists a great number of tough decisions on you that most people would be loathe to even ponder, let alone make. Is the life of your child worth more than the life of a stranger? Is it worth more than your own life? Would you spare your bitter enemy from a grisly death? Forgive a lover's betrayal? The game flings these sorts of either/or scenarios at you repeatedly, and each choice has dramatic, tangible effects on how the story plays out, even if the effects aren't immediately obvious at the time. And I'm glad they aren't. Since you consider most of these choices under serious duress, the game forces you to make them in a matter of seconds, and then live with whatever the consequences may be. That immediacy adds to the game's gritty realism and the sense than I was contributing to the narrative, rather than just watching it unfold. I got a sour satisfaction out of letting my choices ride as the story went along, even when their ultimate effects were unpalatable.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1281450-rat_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1281450\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1281450-rat_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1281450\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1281450-rat_01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1281450-rat_01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Some decisions you won't want to make.</figcaption></figure>    The only time I went back and immediately replayed scenes from Heavy Rain to make a different choice was when the game's controls prevented me from making the one I wanted the first time. Some of the Sixaxis movements in particular are a little finicky, causing me to miss taking the course of action I wanted even when it was clearly laid out before me.\u00a0It's worth making sure your characters follow the actions you want them to, because the outcome of the story and even its middle parts can vary wildly depending on what you do and don't do. Major, playable characters can die early in the game, significantly altering the flow of events, and there's an enormous number of ways the story can ultimately resolve. Who's dead, who's alive, and what happens to the survivors is entirely variable and fully based on the way you played your version of the game.\u00a0Those moments when I felt like my choices were impeded by the controls were rare but disappointing, since they slowed down a story that was chugging along at full steam under its own quick pacing. Even when my ass--or at least a major decision--wasn't on the line, the clumsy walking controls had me occasionally getting a character stuck in a corner or on a piece of furniture, which just looks silly.<br/> <br/> Anyway, these technical issues are minor and only really glaring in contrast to the overall quality of Heavy Rain's plotting and presentation. Interactive drama, if you'd like to call it that, is certainly a young subset of game design, itself such an iterative process that most other games get the chance to build on the work of their numerous predecessors. Heavy Rain doesn't really have that benefit. It's coming out of mostly uncharted territory, and it's an impressive effort for that limitation.

The proliferation of new, often very specific gameplay ideas is intrinsic to game development, but these are both games that are particularly unapologetic about where their inspiration comes from. Darksiders is a whole-cloth tribute to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time\">               The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</a>--and, by association, all of the main Zelda games released since--which applies a darker, bloodier motif to that very specific gameplay formula. Similarly, Dante's Inferno takes the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-244\" href=\"/god-of-war/3025-244/\" slug=\"god-of-war\">              God of War</a> format and swaps out a brutal, heavy-metal take on Greek <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2051\" href=\"/mythology/3015-2051/\" slug=\"mythology\">             mythology</a> with a brutal, heavy-metal take on the medieval vision of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-24\" href=\"/hell/3035-24/\" slug=\"hell\">            Hell</a><i>.</i> <br/>\u00a0<br/>The key difference here is that, while Darksiders delivered the Dark Zelda game that certain fans have been demanding of Nintendo, Dante's Inferno simply feels like an off-brand version of the game it's aping. It's not quite the <i>Transmorphers: Fall of Man</i>  to God of War's <i>Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen</i>  in terms of the quality of the experience, but it's hard to shake the sense that you've already played a better, more inspired version of this game. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Aside from its naked cribbing from God of War--which extends from the tone of the rage-driven narrative to the rage-and-combo-driven combat system--the other significant characteristic of Dante's Inferno is that it is very, very loosely based on an important piece of classic literature. Regardless of whether you hold <i>The Divine Comedy</i>  in high regard or have never even heard of it before, rest assured, there's enough distance between the source and the game that it's kind of a moot point. Other than some character names and the occasional chunk of prose, the primary influence Alighieri's epic poem seems on the game is its savagely poetic depiction of Hell. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Here you travel through the nine circles of Hell as a character named Dante--a character whose connection to the Dante from <i>The Divine Comedy</i>  doesn't seem to go very far beyond the namesake and the vintage. He's a Crusader burdened with his own considerable sins who seems to be fighting as much for his own redemption as he is the soul of his wife Beatrice, which belongs to an unnervingly well-endowed Lucifer. There's a lot of righteously indignant yelling on Dante's behalf, who, like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-645\" href=\"/kratos/3005-645/\" slug=\"kratos\">           Kratos</a>, is a character all but defined by his disrespect for the rigid hierarchy of mythological realms, a trait that's pretty well galvanized when Dante beats the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-955\" href=\"/death/3005-955/\" slug=\"death\">          Grim Reaper</a> (I guess to death?) at the start of the game and makes Death's scythe his own. <br/>\u00a0<br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1043053-dantesinferno1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043053\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1043053-dantesinferno1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1043053\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1043053-dantesinferno1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Clearly, a good face-stabbing will clear up this problem.</figcaption></figure>     And so, Dante works his way to the icy center of the Inferno through a grotesque menagerie of sinners and demons, each more damnable than the next. Perhaps it just speaks to how influential <i>The Divine Comedy</i>  has been on the modern perception of Hell as a physical place, but a lot of Dante's Inferno looks generically hellish. The color palette modulates a bit as you progress, and there's some stylized 2D animation--seemingly inspired by <i>Hellboy</i> artist <a data-ref-id=\"3040-51941\" href=\"/mike-mignola/3040-51941/\" slug=\"mike-mignola\">         Mike Mignola</a>--used to tie Dante's personal transgressions with the circle of Hell he's currently in, but mostly it's all fire and brimstone, writhing corpse piles, and a generally dungeonesque motif. Dante's Inferno also tries to play the part of provocateur, most apparently with some of its character designs. I can admire the imagination of the artists who conjured up some of this imagery, but having you fight unbaptized babies is clearly designed to shock, but the only thing that's really shocking about it is how calculated it all seems.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>             As for the gameplay make-up, well, I don't mean to harp on this point, but it feels <i>remarkably</i> similar to God of War. I suppose I wouldn't feel so compelled to mention this point repeatedly if the specificity of it wasn't so startling. You've got light and heavy attacks you can string into combos, as well as a limited selection of magic attacks that often serve to enhance Dante's range of attack with his scythe. There's the occasional box-pushing/lever-pulling puzzle, and there are outsized boss fights and vicious, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">        quick-time</a> finishing moves, but I felt like I spent a disproportionate amount of the game squaring off with low-level enemies by the half-dozen, over and over again. It's all very sound mechanically, with Dante having a pretty substantial suite of attacks, and different enemies, as well as different combinations of enemies, requiring different tactics, but it can be wearying after a while. <br/>\u00a0<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1214020-2009_09_18_09_25_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1214020\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1214020-2009_09_18_09_25_00.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1214020\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1214020-2009_09_18_09_25_00.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1214020-2009_09_18_09_25_00.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Yup, killing babies is messed up. Good job, Dante's Inferno! </figcaption></figure> This issue comes to a head near the end of the game, when you're subjected to a series of arena battles, each with its own unique win condition, and it's a section of the game that barely conceals its role as filler. Now Dante's Inferno is not an easy game, but my experience with these trials was particularly taxing, and I felt like I was being asked to perform in specific ways that the game simply hadn't prepared me for. Maybe my decision early on to pursue the evil end of the game's two-sided skill tree almost exclusively left me underdeveloped in some key ways, but whatever the reason, the negative impact this had on my experience was palpable.<br/>\u00a0<br/>Imitation is an open invitation for comparison, and while it's mostly competent from a technical perspective, it's all very rote. Since God of War is a PlayStation 3 exclusive, I suppose there's some merit to the way Dante's Inferno exposes this very specific style of character-based action game on the Xbox 360, but it's clearly an imitation, and I never got the sense that the game aspired to much beyond simple reproduction.", "deck": "That Dante's Inferno is almost proudly derivative of Sony's God of War series isn't inherently a bad thing, but its lack of unique accomplishments makes for a hollow experience.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-263/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-24827/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dantes-inferno/3030-24827/", "id": 24827, "name": "Dante's Inferno"}, "score": 2, "publish_date": "2010-02-27 13:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-80428/", "id": 80428, "name": "Dante's Inferno"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/battlefield-bad-company-2-review/1900-264/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/1289129-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_44_23_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1289129\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"1360\" style=\"width: 1360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/1289129-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_44_23_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1289129\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2352/1289129-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_44_23_20.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Chopper Flynn.\u00a0</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25246\" href=\"/battlefield-bad-company-2/3030-25246/\" slug=\"battlefield-bad-company-2\">Battlefield: Bad Company 2</a> builds off of the previous game by adding more multiplayer options and refinements and delivering a new single-player campaign. As someone who happened to enjoy the previous game a great deal, this is a fantastic thing. But the single-player campaign, despite offering a lot of the same charm and character that made the first Bad Company so memorable, doesn't pack the same punch the second time around. Sure, the wholesale destruction of buildings has gotten a bit better, but it feels like you aren't put in enough situations to actually take advantage of that fact on a regular basis.

There's a natural sound to the voicework that makes them seem like some regular guys thrust into some pretty messed-up military maneuvers. Last time around, they broke ranks and attempted to steal a truckload of gold. In fact, the ending of the first game implies that they got away with some of that gold, too. But there's no mention of the gold in Bad Company 2. In fact, the events of the first game aren't really referenced at all during the main story. Instead, the same four guys are sent after a mysterious super-weapon that dates back to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-471\" href=\"/world-war-ii/3015-471/\" slug=\"world-war-ii\">World War II</a>, which makes a guest appearance in the game's prologue level before things get going in modern times. After a brief stint in <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1718\" href=\"/alaska/3035-1718/\" slug=\"alaska\">Alaska</a> to set up some of the action, B-Company is transferred into a special ops division and sent off to Bolivia. There's a bit of globetrotting going on between missions, but the core mission of finding out more about this secret weapon and stopping the people who would hope to uncover its secrets and use it against the <a data-ref-id=\"3035-396\" href=\"/the-united-states-of-america/3035-396/\" slug=\"the-united-states-of-america\">United States</a> remains the same.<br/> <br/> Though you stick with your squad throughout the game, you don't often feel like you're fighting right alongside <a data-ref-id=\"3005-854\" href=\"/george-haggard/3005-854/\" slug=\"george-haggard\">Haggard</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-682\" href=\"/sweetwater/3005-682/\" slug=\"sweetwater\">Sweetwater</a>, and the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-844\" href=\"/sergeant-redford/3005-844/\" slug=\"sergeant-redford\">Sarge</a>. After battles cool down, they seem to stand around, and it feels like they're warping ahead of you when you start running to the next checkpoint, just to make sure that they're in position for any scripted sequence or dialogue that may come up. Overall, I felt pretty disconnected from a lot of the action, and the campaign often felt pretty mindless.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/1289133-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_54_13_47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1289133\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"1360\" style=\"width: 1360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/1289133-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_54_13_47.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1289133\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2352/1289133-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_54_13_47.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0In single-player, there are new guys to mow down around every corner... like this corner up ahead, for instance.</figcaption></figure>     However, a lot of that is because I wasn't stopping to let the environment and the squad sink in. There's a fair amount of incidental dialogue from your squad in Bad Company 2, but since they tend to stand still and not stick with you whenever there's no fighting going on, it's very easy to miss. If you stand around with the guys for a bit, you'll hear some hilarious exchanges, with jokes usually made at the expense of Haggard, the Texas redneck of the crew. In one moment, he'll attempt to tell the team that he's fluent in Spanish... or Spanglish, at least. But then he'll refuse to actually speak it. In another, he'll comedically brush up against the edges of racial sensitivity by asking the Sarge why \"Afro-Americans\" pronounce the rapper's name as \"Fiddy\" Cent instead of \"Fifty.\" In yet another, he'll talk about how there are parts of his brain that could certainly use some washing. They'll debate the existence of God and what makes a man eligible to go to Heaven. At one point one of them will talk about the \"big bong in the sky.\" The characters talk over each other and interrupt one another in a very natural way that sounds more like a movie scene than a video game. But the main story dialogue, by comparison, is extremely on-task and usually very dry. It's also received a liberal sprinkling of <i>Generation Kill</i>-inspired mil-speak, just like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24713\" href=\"/modern-warfare-2/3030-24713/\" slug=\"modern-warfare-2\">Modern Warfare 2</a>, so expect to hear more than a few \"Oscar Mikes\" in there. And unless you make it a point to wait around for those incidental moments to trigger--and they don't seem to always pop up in the same place--you're going to miss the best part of Bad Company 2's approximately seven-hour campaign.<br/> <br/> The action in the campaign feels flat in spots. The big thing about the first game was the introduction of destructible buildings and other covered positions. Walls blast apart beautifully when you launch grenades into them, and using a tank to decimate everything around you can be satisfying, as well. All of that returns for Bad Company 2, and you can now hit some buildings so hard that they collapse entirely. But the areas you're fighting through often don't take advantage of those strengths. There aren't many situations where you're given enough explosive hardware and enough nearby buildings to really tear the scenery apart, and it makes Bad Company feel a little less unique in the process. You'll move from point A to point B, shooting down everything that gets in your path. You can't absorb a ton of punishment, either, so you'll have to play fairly conservatively in hectic situations. Primarily, it just doesn't feel as wild as the first game did, even though it pushes many of the same buttons along the way with tank battles, a few spots where you're firing from mounted weapons on helicopters, and so on.<br/> <br/> Meanwhile, the multiplayer side of Bad Company 2 feels like it got significantly more attention during the development process. To the casual onlooker, the differences might not seem enormous, but if you got up close with the first game and stayed there for a good length of time, you'll definitely appreciate the new modes. Conquest mode, which was released as an add-on for the previous game, comes stock now, and you can also play in squad deathmatch mode, where four teams of four players each fight it out until one squad gets 50 kills. There's also a mode called squad rush, which plays like a speed round of the standard rush mode for up to eight players. In squad rush, the attacking team only gets 20 tickets, but there's only one point to destroy at a time. If the attacking team can destroy two such control points, they win. It's a great mode for players who might not always have time to play through a full rush or conquest match. On the downside, squad rush is currently a pre-order bonus for console versions of the game, and will be that way for 30 days following the game's release, at which point it will be unlocked for all to use. Additionally, the game ships with a \"VIP\" code in the box on consoles, which like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21590\" href=\"/mass-effect-2/3030-21590/\" slug=\"mass-effect-2\">Mass Effect 2</a> and other games before it, is designed to deter second-hand purchasers by locking them out of certain content. Or you could look at it as \"if you buy the game new, you'll get a free map pack out of it in a few weeks.\" Debating the pros and cons of such tactics is outside the scope of this review, but consider yourself informed about the nature of this game's code-based offerings. PC owners get squad rush immediately, with no code required.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/1289136-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_55_59_46.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1289136\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56470588235294\" data-width=\"1360\" style=\"width: 1360px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/2352/1289136-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_55_59_46.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1289136\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2352/1289136-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_55_59_46.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/2352/1289136-bfbc2game_2010_03_02_22_55_59_46.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The characters of Bad Company are still, well, characters.</figcaption></figure>     Regardless of the modes and all that other stuff, the action in multiplayer remains largely the same, which is to say that it has a tactical depth that most shooters lack. You can hit a button to \"spot\" enemies, causing them to show up on your team's radar for a few seconds. You can pilot a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3350\" href=\"/unmanned-aerial-vehicle/3055-3350/\" slug=\"unmanned-aerial-vehicle\">UAV</a>, giving you a sky-high view of the map, which makes it easier to spot for your team, though the drone can also fire a few missiles at targets. The UAV, as it turns out, leads to one of my favorite things to do in Bad Company 2: sneaking up on someone that's currently using the UAV station and stabbing them in the back, then sending the UAV crashing to earth. Of course, other vehicles are in play, giving you plenty of chances to royally mess up while attempting to pilot a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-361\" href=\"/helicopter/3055-361/\" slug=\"helicopter\">helicopter</a> or drive a tank while shooting at targets. The game retains its layered approach to unlockable items by tying most of its weaponry to the specific classes. So by playing as a medic, you'll gain additional medic weapons, which are usually light machine guns. By playing the engineer class, you'll get more submachine guns and gain access to the repair drill, which you'll need if you want to repair vehicles. Though I'm effectively married to the assault class and its ability to toss out ammo crates to help resupply troops in the field, the classes all have a different feel that makes them compliment each other very well.<br/> <br/> The things that sticks with me about the multiplayer, though, is its audio. While most games can do up-close gunfire extremely well these days, once you get further away, it often loses a lot of its character. Battlefield's indoor/outdoor exchanges, where you might hear someone firing their <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1323\" href=\"/xm8/3055-1323/\" slug=\"xm8\">XM8</a> all the way across the map while standing around a corner, all sound acoustically appropriate. Weapons fire and explosions muffle properly at range and echo around the environment amazingly well. You'll hear callouts from the troops as they perform tasks, and all of them sound, well, kind of savage. Hearing an American soldier curse up a storm as he's stabbing an enemy from behind is downright jarring, compared to the dry military talk that most other multiplayer shooters deliver. It's impressive, and all of that audio goes a long way toward making Bad Company 2 feel <i>huge</i>.<br/> <br/> That huge feel has always been the big differentiator between the Battlefield series and other first-person shooters, and Bad Company 2's multiplayer has plenty of that to go around. Where the first Bad Company felt like a solid take on placing the PC-friendly Battlefield experience on consoles, Bad Company 2 settles in and feels right at home on both consoles and PC. This no longer feels like a compromise made to keep the console kids busy while PC owners wait for the next \"real\" Battlefield game. It feels a lot more like the genuine article, streamlined and bumped up to 2010 standards. If you appreciate the way <a data-ref-id=\"3025-51\" href=\"/battlefield/3025-51/\" slug=\"battlefield\">Battlefield</a> has done this kind of open, spacious warfare in the past, you're going to love it.

By raising the level cap to an awkward 61, The Secret Armory of General Knoxx is the best piece of downloadable content for Borderlands by default. Adding additional vehicles, weapons, and enemy types to the mix only further establishes this third add-on as a must-own for Borderlands aficionados looking for something meaningful that actually builds on the main game in exciting ways.<br/> <br/> Knoxx is set after the events of Borderlands' main story. So the vault has been opened, and its contents have been dealt with. The new threat is the return of the Atlas Corporation. So most of the enemies you'll see in this add-on are new types of Crimson Lance troops, including medics, shock troopers, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-6\" href=\"/jet-pack/3055-6/\" slug=\"jet-pack\">jet pack</a> dudes, and so on. Though there are plenty of side missions, the core story missions point you in the direction of the disaffected <a data-ref-id=\"3005-14034\" href=\"/general-knoxx/3005-14034/\" slug=\"general-knoxx\">General Knoxx</a>, who's sitting on top of an armory full of weapons. At the end, you'll face the general and get to take a quick sprint through his weapon-filled vault, which will hopefully contain some goods worth holding onto. At the very least, you could always just grab stuff and sell it later, but considering you'll have finished the game and will probably be close to or above the level cap at this point, money probably hasn't been a concern for you in a very long time. Still, the characters are interesting, the game is still quite funny, and the additional enemies make combat fun again. The new Lance enemies--though incredibly susceptible to corrosive weapons--can be tricky. In fact, I probably died more playing through General Knoxx than I did on my entire second playthrough of the main game.<br/> <br/> Between the core missions and the side stuff, you could easily spend another 10 hours or more going through General Knoxx. That's a bit longer than it probably should be, though, since there aren't any fast travel points to be had. Once you warp into T-Bone Junction, the central town area where most of the magic happens, you'll have to drive everywhere else. All of that traveling gets pretty tedious over time, and it eventually led to me simply quitting the game and restarting it to \"fast travel\" back to town to cash in quests.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1258219-mech_1282010_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1258219\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/7465/1258219-mech_1282010_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1258219\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/7465/1258219-mech_1282010_2.jpg\"></a><figcaption>And he's got a big robot suit that'll make dusting your party significantly easier.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     While the more challenging combat makes for a satisfying set of quests, there are still some things that don't quite work out according to plan. Take, for example, Crawmerax. This <a data-ref-id=\"3015-747\" href=\"/giant-enemy-crab/3015-747/\" slug=\"giant-enemy-crab\">giant enemy crab</a> is meant to be the hardest fight in the entire game, and he's only available after you've defeated the poor general and seen the end credits. He certainly can be tough, but small ledges around the edge of his arena give you a space to take cover, and if all of the players hide out long enough, the crab gets locked into an animation loop, making him almost totally harmless. Of course, beating that thing without using the exploit isn't much fun, either. There's also a set of arena-style challenges where you have to face off against huge waves of enemy troops to proceed. In one of these, an enemy seemed to spawn in the environment, making him impossible to kill and forcing the players to quit and start again.<br/> <br/> Of course, this stuff is fairly easy to overlook if you're already so into Borderlands that you'd do just about anything to get more meaningful content. After the lackluster <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20487\" href=\"/borderlands/3030-20487/reviews/?review_id=247/\" slug=\"borderlands\">Mad Moxxi add-on</a>,\u00a0just about anything would be more meaningful.

While the technology has advanced, the relative shortage of meaningful changes and refinements to God of War's vivisecting gameplay formula means that it's not quite as thrilling as the first (or second) go 'round.

Of course, Kratos can't just walk right up to Zeus, gut him like a trout, and roll credits, so you'll spend most of the ten-or-so hours of God of War III trying to collect the mythical objects that Kratos believes he needs to finish the job. Of course, on the way, Kratos will face off with, and usually murder, whatever significant figures of Greek mythology he didn't already turn into a red smear in the first two games, all in the most unflinchingly graphic, <i>Verhoeven-esque</i>  way possible.\u00a0\u00a0</p> \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0<figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33759/1247450-2132403904_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247450\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33759/1247450-2132403904_full.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247450\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33759/1247450-2132403904_full.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0It's called God of War, not God of Friendly Handshakes.</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">If God of War III is your introduction to the series, there's a brief video that will basically catch you up to speed, though at this point, all you really need to know is that Kratos is an angry jerk, and pretty much everyone else he encounters is a vindictive, condescending, double-dealing jerk. His bottomless anger seemed justified in the beginning, but his continued insistence to pursue his vengeance at the cost of, basically, the entire known world makes it hard to conjure up much compassion, and makes him seem more like a petulant child than an unrelenting instrument of righteousness. The line between anti-hero and villain can be razor thin, and I occasionally found myself feeling more like I was the antagonist in someone else's story. Kratos is a consistently sadistic son of a bitch, and it's been his sole character trait for so long that certain turns in the story feel unearned. It's hard to tell exactly where the series will go from here--not to say that the ending is anticlimactic, but its gestures towards closure seem... tentative.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">\u00a0\u00a0<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">The gameplay experience that wraps around this revenge tour doesn't venture too far from the rhythms of the previous God of War games, focusing primarily on contained group fights, mixing it up with some traversal sequences, some lever-pulling and box-pushing puzzles, and some really huge boss fights, with plenty of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">quick time events</a> to highlight the game's penchant for cinematic flair.

I found it kind of odd that two of the alternate weapons you pick up are variations on the basic chain blade motif, which compelled me to pretty much ignore them in favor of the more distinctive Nemean Cestus, a massive pair of lion-headed gauntlets that favor impact over range. Regardless of your weapons of choice, success in battle in God of War III ultimately comes down to diligent use of Kratos' dodge and counter abilities, as well as knowing which of Kratos' plentiful attacks to use on specific enemies or in specific situations, with a certain eye towards crowd control.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">\u00a0\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">Save for a handful of eye-catching sequences that make unique use of the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1346\" href=\"/icarus/3005-1346/\" slug=\"icarus\">Icarus</a> wings, I found most of the traversal stuff not necessarily bad, but something to fill the downtime in between the administration of savage beatings. For as terrific as God of War III looks--and it is easily one of the best-looking PlayStation 3 games out there right now--there's something vaguely mechanical about the way Kratos shimmies along ledges and swings from his chains.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">\u00a0\u00a0</p><p style=\"\">Similarly, the quick time events are implemented in such a way that I sometimes felt they were drawing my attention away from the flashy camera moves and gruesome acts they were intended to highlight. It's all the stuff that you expect from a God of War game, which I suspect is the very reason why parts of the game feel kind of perfunctory. It's like the developers had a mechanical understanding of the beats they were expected to hit, and focused more on nailing that stuff than pushing the experience somewhere new.\u00a0</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25993/1269065-2pplp9l.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1269065\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/25993/1269065-2pplp9l.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1269065\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25993/1269065-2pplp9l.png\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/25993/1269065-2pplp9l.png\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Fighting a Titan is like fighting a mountain that hates you.</figcaption></figure> <p style=\"\">These issues, however, hardly define the experience of God of War III. No, God of War, as always, is all about vividly grotesque ways in which Kratos fells his enemies, and an incredible sense of scale as you take down one impossibly leviathanic enemy after another. Aside from the flight sequences I mentioned earlier, the most amazing moments in God of War III for me revolved around the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2302\" href=\"/titan/3015-2302/\" slug=\"titan\">Titans</a>, the huge, primitive elder gods that preceded the Olympians. Acting as both enemy and environment, the Titans are the best example of God of War III's capacity to make you feel simultaneously powerful and insignificant, as the camera zooms out from a standard third-person view of Kratos to a perspective that makes him look like a flea on the Titan's back, all in real-time, and all of it looking incredibly sharp. Kratos himself features an impressive level of detail, both during gameplay but particularly in cutscenes, to the point that the other characters can look a little crude by comparison--which, really, says more about how good Kratos looks than anything else.\u00a0</p>\u00a0<br/><p style=\"\">The beautiful rendering of Kratos' ugliness is what made God of War III a compelling experience for me, despite of the bits that felt unnecessarily slavish to the God of War formula.

By stripping away some of the more complex elements of resource-gathering and other staples of the real-time strategy genre, C&amp;C4 makes individual units feel almost entirely meaningless, leaving you little reason to actually strategize your way through its campaign, since you can just pump out more units as your existing ones get taken down without penalty. When placed together with a lackluster campaign and a persistent online progression system that means you won't be able to see the game's best units until you've invested way more time into the game than it deserves, Tiberian Twilight feels like it was designed to kill interest in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-98\" href=\"/command-conquer/3025-98/\" slug=\"command-conquer\">Command &amp; Conquer franchise</a>.<br/> <br/> The disappointing part about all this is that the changes made to the franchise sound like a good idea. Rather than turtling up and building an elaborate base, or immediately feeling the brunt of an early game rush, C&amp;C4 works on a much smaller scale. In most games, you'll be limited to somewhere between 10 and 30-ish units at any given time. The major limiting factor is a command points cap, and most units take three or six points to spawn. Units build out of your crawler, a class-based structure that you can pick up and walk around the map at will, allowing you to set up camp anywhere you like, for as long as you like. And if your crawler gets blown away in a fight, the game doesn't end. Instead, you can spawn a new crawler and keep going. There's a cap on respawns in campaign games to give you an eventual way to fail.<br/> <br/> The game's three classes play a bit differently and offer different units. The offense class gets the heavy ground-based vehicles and plays fairly straightforwardly. Defense gets infantry units and defensive structures, like bunkers and turrets. This means the defensive crawler has a build radius and also has a power limit, which is sort of like the command point limit for units, but instead prevents you from just creating a zillion turrets all over the map. Support gets the air-based units and an energy meter that allows you to cast support powers, like airstrikes or a healing radius. The energy refills on its own and lets you sort of hang back and still make an impact on the battle.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1277098-cnc4_februaryspscreen3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1277098\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56782334384858\" data-width=\"1902\" style=\"width: 1902px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1277098-cnc4_februaryspscreen3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1277098\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1277098-cnc4_februaryspscreen3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The maps are small, which keeps things moving at a decent pace.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     The campaign is meant to tie up the current story arc, which has <a data-ref-id=\"3005-217\" href=\"/kane/3005-217/\" slug=\"kane\">Kane</a> and the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2945\" href=\"/brotherhood-of-nod/3015-2945/\" slug=\"brotherhood-of-nod\">Brotherhood of Nod</a>\u00a0sort of making peace with <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2946\" href=\"/global-defense-initiative/3015-2946/\" slug=\"global-defense-initiative\">GDI</a> in a last-ditch attempt to save the planet, which is being overrun and contaminated by tiberium, the same crystal-based form of energy that kicked off this entire war to begin with. Though attempts were made to make the franchise's signature video sequences a bit better and more serious, the story falls flat from start to finish. Previously, the sequences were bad in a campy and fun way, often with a little stunt casting to sweeten the pot. Now, they're just bad. <a data-ref-id=\"3040-1073\" href=\"/joseph-d-kucan/3040-1073/\" slug=\"joseph-d-kucan\">Joe Kucan</a> continues to be the high point as the charismatic villain, Kane, but even his role feels pointless in the grand scheme of things. Overall, it's full of characters you won't care about double-crossing each other in ways that barely matter.<br/> <br/> Of course, it's not hard to see that the game's multiplayer is probably where the developers hope you spend most of your time. The game has a persistent progression system that works across all modes, and as you level up, you'll unlock additional units and upgrades that make you more effective in battle. This is unfortunate, in a way, because low-level players aren't going to have access to the more useful tactics until they earn enough experience points to even the playing field. Normally, the response would be to say \"well, just play against people of your level.\" But the game doesn't seem to be great at automatically matching players up that way. The XP system also comes at the cost of requiring an Internet connection at all times. I'd guess that this is to preserve the sanctity of the unlocks by storing your status server-side, but it also means that even if you want to skirmish or play the campaign, you'll need to be connected. And if you happen to get disconnected, your progress goes right out the window. The only other \"benefit\" of being connected all the time is that a chat room sits at the bottom of every menu screen, which is handy if you want to see people attempting to chat in Russian or love reading complaints about the game you're currently playing.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/263342-kanerevealed2_hires_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263342\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/5892/263342-kanerevealed2_hires_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-263342\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/263342-kanerevealed2_hires_1_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/5892/263342-kanerevealed2_hires_1_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Kane deserves a better send-off.</figcaption></figure>     Once you actually get into an online game, you'll find that the action is very different from the C&amp;C games of the past. Instead of simply exterminating the opposing side, you'll need to hold down control points on the map. Holding points and destroying enemy units both contribute to your team's score, and the first team to 2,500 points wins the match. You can still respawn your crawler as many times as you need, but since the enemy is earning points each time your crawler is destroyed, you've got a bit more of an incentive to stay safe. The matches are very fast, and swarms of lower-end units seem to do better than teched-up mammoth units, which adds to the speed. It's very different than the typical C&amp;C multiplayer, and it really feels like someone just went and applied a first-person shooter game type to an RTS. It's a cool idea that you might get into if you're already accustomed to playing RTS games competitively. I thought that maybe the simplified nature of the game would mean that dopes like me who are only good at getting stomped out in a mutliplayer RTS game would get a fresh lease on life. This does not appear to be the case, and even though the teams can get up to five per side, the battles are still small enough that everyone needs to be on their game in order to succeed.<br/> <br/> Though it has two campaigns and a healthy array of maps for skirmish and multiplayer, Command &amp; Conquer 4 feels like it's missing about half-a-game's worth of content. There are some neat ideas in play, but the action itself isn't strong enough to make it all work, and the cutscenes aren't good enough to make you forget that the game isn't all that hot.

While at first look you might expect a spiritual sequel to S.T.A.L.K.E.R. (there are even guitar-playing crooners to greet you at the campfire), Metro 2033 is a smaller, more focused game.

After volunteering to help a seasoned soldier known as \"Hunter,\" you learn of an impending attack by a flood of Dark Ones--the mysterious paranormals of the underground. Soon you're on your way to battling Dark Ones, bandits, and Nazis (yeah, those guys are somehow still around) and generally raising hell on your way to stop the flood. It may sound like a familiar story, but Metro 2033 does quite well by keeping the threat level high and the lights off through most of your journey. It's a dark game in both senses of the word and avoids a lot of the happy cliches you might expect in this genre.<br/><br/> The story is told in a linear fashion that has Artyom (who weirdly only speaks through narrated loading screens) moving from town to town trying to find someone who understands the Dark Ones' threat and is willing to help out. Around half of the missions have you moving along your journey with whatever friendly soldiers happen across your path, though often you'll get separated and have to go through the cramped tunnels alone. It's in these moments that Metro 2033 successfully embraces its survival horror side with some keep-the-light-on stumbling that feels similar to the better parts of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14537\" href=\"/doom-3/3030-14537/\" slug=\"doom-3\">Doom 3</a>. That's not to say that this is strictly a monster-closet scarefest, though, as Metro features quite a few clever puzzles and stealth elements. Be aware, though, if you aren't a fan of horror games, Metro 2033 likely isn't your game. Its HUD-free interface and visceral audio effects keep you focused on the action enough that you'll quickly learn to read Artyom's breathing patterns as a sign of trouble.<br/><br/> The well-done audio and lighting play a part in Metro 2033's stealth mechanics as well, which allow you to avoid detection and silently kill troops by keeping to the shadows or turning off the various lanterns that litter certain stealth-friendly levels. Unfortunately, while the sneaky parts of the game certainly work, it's not always consistent. I often found myself giving up on them entirely in favor of hunkering down and letting the enemies come to me. The stealth bits generally aren't up to the same standards as some of the better sneaker-shooter games (<a data-ref-id=\"3025-146\" href=\"/deus-ex/3025-146/\" slug=\"deus-ex\">Deus Ex</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3025-280\" href=\"/thief/3025-280/\" slug=\"thief\">Thief</a>) and you might find yourself similarly frustrated with portions of the game.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1277758-metro_2033___environments_and_gameplay__hd_720p__028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1277758\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1277758-metro_2033___environments_and_gameplay__hd_720p__028.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1277758\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1277758-metro_2033___environments_and_gameplay__hd_720p__028.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0You'll be able to restock in many of the towns you come across.</figcaption></figure>     As you make your way through Moscow you'll collect unique gear, weapons, and ammo that can be bought and sold at shops. The main currency of Metro is--wait for it--bullets. <i>Pristine</i> bullets to be specific. You'll find cartridges of the stuff on dead bodies and on shelves, which you can either decide to use in your weapon for more stopping power or trade in later for a higher quantity of rusty bullets. While this sounds great in terms of story (after all, what's more important to dudes that do a lot of shooting than bullets), in practice Metro 2033 is very stingy with the ammo. I found myself out of bullets quite early in the game and never really recovered from that mishap. This was complicated even further when I encountered a technical hiccup with the save-game system that prevented additional attempts to play through early levels from sticking to my save.<br/><br/> Pristine bullets will also buy you new weapons, which are split between <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1021\" href=\"/revolver/3055-1021/\" slug=\"revolver\">revolvers</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotguns</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-413\" href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" slug=\"assault-rifle\">assault rifles</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-295\" href=\"/knife/3055-295/\" slug=\"knife\">knives</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenades</a>. You can only hold one gun of any one type at a time, and most guns come in silent, scoped, or stopping power varieties. It's usually good to keep one of each type around, as most of the guns in Metro 2033 are ineffective at range. Actually, most of the guns don't carry much of a kick unless you specifically go for stealth or a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-85\" href=\"/headshot/3015-85/\" slug=\"headshot\">headshot</a>. With long weapon reload times that give <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21478\" href=\"/cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason/3030-21478/\" slug=\"cryostasis-the-sleep-of-reason\">Cryostasis</a> a run for its money you'll find yourself doing a lot of running while you're reloading, which wouldn't be so bad, except that Metro 2033 features a lot of tight corridors without a lot of places to hide. In general, the weapons accurately fit the theme of the game, as you wouldn't expect to find a perfectly maintained\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3055-187\" href=\"/ak-47/3055-187/\" slug=\"ak-47\">AK-47</a> in the sewer muck that infests this version of Moscow.<br/><br/> The best gear in Metro 2033 is the gear worn on your head. You'll very quickly learn that you won't last long in the irradiated above-ground sequences without equipping a gas mask and will die just as quickly without night-vision goggles when underground. While your night-vision will drain its battery and need to be recharged, your gas mask (with replaceable filters) will take damage separate from your health. Take too much trauma and your mask will not only visibly scar but could crack, in which case you have all of 15 or so seconds to find a new one. While under the mask, the entire soundscape of Metro 2033 changes considerably. The voice of the comrade on your right is now coming in through your radio and all the echos of this watery world undergo a Barry White bass overdrive. In general, both effects are pulled off very well and really increase the believability of this scary, unhealthy place.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29656/1303209-metro_2033___pc___full_detail___1080p_screenshot_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1303209\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/29656/1303209-metro_2033___pc___full_detail___1080p_screenshot_3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1303209\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29656/1303209-metro_2033___pc___full_detail___1080p_screenshot_3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/29656/1303209-metro_2033___pc___full_detail___1080p_screenshot_3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The Dark Ones serve as the main bad guys of Metro 2033.</figcaption></figure>     Also unhealthy are the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-733\" href=\"/mutants/3015-733/\" slug=\"mutants\">mutants</a>, paranormals, and bandits that make up the majority of enemies in the game. Mutants come in few a varieties: small rats, big rats, and flying rats. All of them share some occasionally embarrassing animation and AI. Usually, the mutants prefer to simply jump straight at you from ten feet away. This makes some of the combat in Metro 2033 fairly simplistic. A couple of sidesteps and the occasional <a data-ref-id=\"3015-6\" href=\"/quick-time-event/3015-6/\" slug=\"quick-time-event\">quick time event</a> (there is only one kind) and you're usually fine. Unfortunately, most of the game is fought in hallways so you don't have much room to move. The human enemies are a bit more fun and will take cover, flank you, and generally behave as you'd expect. Those fights, especially those when you're outnumbered, are actually quite challenging and you'll find yourself needing to strategically think about your fights without going in guns-blazing.<br/><br/> It's worth nothing that Metro 2033 is a single-player only affair and clocks in at around eight hours. So it's a pretty quick ride. There's very little reason to replay it unless you plan on going for many of the game's level-specific achievements. Technically the game does well enough on the 360, but in very specific lighting situations it's prone to framerate issues. Like other games that originate from Eastern Europe, the overall visual quality see-saws between stunning and silly on a texture-by-texture basis, but the audio, effects, and lighting are the clear winners here.<br/><br/>Metro 2033 successfully constructs a believable world that delivers a setting and story that get past the core annoyances of its gameplay. When you first watch steam escape from creaky 10-ton doors as they open to reveal the sprawling, murky madness of underground Moscow, you might be able to forgive the goofy monsters, too.

Armed with the mistakes learned from the first go-around and superior technology, <a data-ref-id=\"3010-5927\" href=\"/avalanche-studios/3010-5927/\" slug=\"avalanche-studios\">                   Avalanche Studios</a> has delivered a sublimely ridiculous open-world action game  that values cheap visceral thrills over reality at nearly every possible turn<i>.</i>  It's often more fun to just muck around in this expansive, explosive sandbox with all these wonderfully destructive toys than it is to adhere to the proper mission structure, but it's hard to complain when you're hurtling through the air, blowing up everything you see.<br/> <br/>   In proper sequel fashion, Just Cause 2 happily rehashes the setup from the first game, though the action is moved from a fictionalized corrupt island nation in the  <a data-ref-id=\"3035-113\" href=\"/caribbean/3035-113/\" slug=\"caribbean\">Caribbean</a> to a fictionalized corrupt island nation in the South Pacific, again putting you in the role of swarthy Latin caricature and superhuman <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2988\" href=\"/central-intelligence-agency/3015-2988/\" slug=\"central-intelligence-agency\">                   CIA</a> agent <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1867\" href=\"/rico-rodriguez/3005-1867/\" slug=\"rico-rodriguez\">                   Rico Rodriguez</a>. You're initially sent there to hunt down an old comrade-in-arms who seems to have gone all Colonel Kurtz, but you quickly find yourself in league with multiple rebel factions intent on taking down the militaristic regime that's currently in power. Everything, of course, is not as it seems, though the twists and turns aren't themselves as interesting as some of the set pieces they help justify, including a grand finale that outdoes the climax of the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-18163\" href=\"/just-cause/3030-18163/\" slug=\"just-cause\">                   Just Cause</a> on an atomic level. It's pure B-movie fodder, right down to the wide variety of broad stereotypes and consistently terrible accents most of the characters are saddled with. But then again, if you're coming to Just Cause 2 for the story, you're kind of missing the point.               <br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1310702-bike_drop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310702\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56151711378353\" data-width=\"1081\" style=\"width: 1081px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28666/1310702-bike_drop.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1310702\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28666/1310702-bike_drop.jpg\"></a><figcaption>             \u00a0Nope, nothing crazy to see here.  Move along!</figcaption></figure>What fundamentally set the first Just Cause apart from the sea of middling open-world action games was the unique toolset it provided the player. You had a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-5\" href=\"/grapple/3055-5/\" slug=\"grapple\">                   grappling hook</a> that you could use to hitch a ride on any vehicle that made the mistake of getting close enough, along with a miraculous <a data-ref-id=\"3055-504\" href=\"/parachute/3055-504/\" slug=\"parachute\">                   stunt parachute</a> that offered a quick escape from whatever fiery death you were about to plummet to. You could use the two in tandem, but only being able to grapple onto vehicles limited the freestyle fun you could have. In Just Cause 2, the stunt parachute works basically the same way, magically appearing and disappearing as needed, but the grappling hook now works on <i>any</i> surface that's close enough, effectively turning it into a skeleton key for fun. You can still use it to easily hijack whatever car, boat, helicopter, or plane you can get within grappling distance of, but you can now also use it to yank enemies off high emplacements and work your way up tall buildings.<br/> <br/>One of the more important new tricks in Just Cause 2 involves using the grappling hook on the ground in front of you and deploying the stunt parachute while you're in motion, providing you with immediate lift and forward momentum. Once you're up in the air, you can basically just slingshot your way through the air, provided you stay low enough to the ground to still grapple it. It's a great way to get out of a sticky situation when you're low on health, or when you just need to cover a little ground in a hurry. While the vehicle handling is much more agreeable than it was in the original Just Cause, and most vehicles still feature the \"<a data-ref-id=\"3015-65\" href=\"/stunt-position/3015-65/\" slug=\"stunt-position\">stunt positions</a>\" originated in the first game, the new grapple-parachute dynamics provide so much more mobility that, other than when required by missions, I rarely found myself compelled to stand on top of cars. This is the power of the sequel: what was one of the most satisfying and memorable features of the first game is a second-stringer in Part Two.                          <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1224909-justcause2_nov13_2_11122009_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224909\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1224909-justcause2_nov13_2_11122009_2.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224909\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1224909-justcause2_nov13_2_11122009_2.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1224909-justcause2_nov13_2_11122009_2.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>             \u00a0A helicopter gets the punishment  it oh-so-richly deserves.</figcaption></figure>Oh, but that's not all! By holding down the grapple button, you can also tether any two objects together, which is intermittently useful in a tactical sense, but almost always hilarious. The world is littered with volatile  propane tanks that, when shot, will unpredictably rocket off in whatever direction they're facing--tether an enemy soldier to one of these tanks before igniting it, and they're both likely to become the stratosphere's problem. I also found that, when being pursued by enemy cars and trucks, the most effective way to get them off your tail is to quickly tether them to the side of the road, violently redirecting their forward momentum and causing them to go hurtling through the air.             <br/> <br/>But here's my favorite example of just how ridiculous the grappling hook is in Just Cause 2, and a bold indictment of the most basic laws of physics. When you fall a certain distance, you automatically move into a free-fall position that slows your fall and provides more horizontal mobility. You can fall several stories without taking any damage, but if you hit the ground in the free-fall position, you're done. It used to be that the parachute, or a conveniently placed vehicle, were the only ways to safely transition out of a free fall. Now, once you're close enough, you can just grapple the ground beneath you--which actually makes you move <i>faster</i>  than when you're in free fall--and land without a scratch.                          <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1224908-justcause2_nov13_1_11122009_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224908\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1224908-justcause2_nov13_1_11122009_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224908\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1224908-justcause2_nov13_1_11122009_1.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1224908-justcause2_nov13_1_11122009_1.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>             \u00a0Man, the meter maids in Panau are  friggin' ruthless.</figcaption></figure>These are merely a few examples of the absurd applications you will find for the grappling hook, and the sheer volume of <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=just+cause+2&amp;search_type=&amp;aq=f\" rel=\"nofollow\">                   ridiculous YouTube videos</a> that started cropping up when the demo for Just Cause 2 was released is very telling of this fact. As an open-world game, Just Cause 2 isn't free of its fair share of awkward physical interactions, but it sets such a wide gate for what kinds of behavior are acceptable that its hard to hold any of that weirdness against it. Still, the uniqueness of your skill set can take some getting used to, and pressing the wrong button at the wrong time can often prove calamitous.             <br/> <br/>So what's the point of all these silly-ass action fantasy moves? To facilitate blowing up of as much stuff as possible. The weapons you'll brandish are fairly conventional, including <a data-ref-id=\"3055-766\" href=\"/submachine-gun/3055-766/\" slug=\"submachine-gun\">                   submachine guns</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-413\" href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" slug=\"assault-rifle\">                   assault rifles</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-211\" href=\"/rocket-launcher/3055-211/\" slug=\"rocket-launcher\">                   rocket launchers</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">                   grenades</a>, triggered explosives, and so on. The aiming can be incredibly forgiving, which proves to be a bit of a necessity when you're trying to shoot a sniper out of a helicopter while you're clinging to the front bumper of a speeding jeep.            <br/> <br/>If you find yourself short on ammo, holding the wrong type of weapon, or simply stranded from your desired destination, you can call on a friendly black-market dealer who will airdrop guns and vehicles, or just take you where you want to go, provided you've already discovered the place you're trying to go to. It's through this dealer that you can also upgrade the weapons and vehicles you have access to, using supplies found in the world and earned through missions. Rather than providing a completely destructible environment--ala <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20697\" href=\"/mercenaries-2-world-in-flames/3030-20697/\" slug=\"mercenaries-2-world-in-flames\">                   Mercs 2</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21125\" href=\"/red-faction-guerrilla/3030-21125/\" slug=\"red-faction-guerrilla\">                   Red Faction: Guerrilla</a>--Just Cause 2 limits the stuff you can blow up to vehicles, various explosive canisters, and specific military structures, and it smartly color-codes most destructible objects, making it easy to quickly identify any potential targets.                          <br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1224917-justcause2_nov13_10_11122009_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224917\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1224917-justcause2_nov13_10_11122009_10.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1224917\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1224917-justcause2_nov13_10_11122009_10.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1224917-justcause2_nov13_10_11122009_10.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>             \u00a0I've run  out of clever captions, so please just enjoy this wicked explosion.</figcaption></figure>Missions will be provided by your CIA handlers, as well as the leaders of the various factions, but any kind of destructive mischief you get up to, in-mission or not, will earn you chaos points, the underlying currency of progress in Just Cause 2. It's by earning chaos that you unlock new agency missions, new faction missions, new black-market gear, and peripheral activities like time-trial races. It's a savagely simple system that speaks directly to the whole mission statement of Just Cause 2: the simple joy of blowing stuff up begets more opportunities to blow stuff up. Part of what makes blowing stuff up so much fun in Just Cause 2 is how terrific the explosions look and sound. Characters don't look so great up-close, and I found the smudgy skybox occasionally distracting, but this is a big, detailed world with all sorts of bizarre nooks and crannies to discover, and then blow up.             <br/> <br/>It's a good thing that blowing stuff up is so much fun, because the structure of missions themselves can get kind of repetitive, and I often felt like I was performing the same types of tasks for the three factions over and over again. What it lacks in variety, though, it makes up for with volume. I had sunk a good 20 hours into Just Cause 2 when the credits started to roll, though I had completed a mere 28% of the game, a number that I'm still eager to increase.             <br/> <br/>Not to sound too harsh, but there's nothing all that original about Just Cause 2--this is, in the purest sense, iterative game design.

The series, known for its frantic presentation of quick \"microgames,\" has always preferred simple, goofy tasks over more-elaborate goals. So creating things that stand up to the original creations feels like something that's entirely within reach, given the proper toolset. The great thing about WarioWare DIY is that it has all of the tutorials and tools you'll need to quickly and easily create goofy little microgames. But the tools for sharing those games with others is a bit rudimentary, and, if you're not the creative type, you should know that the pre-made games aren't quite as complex as other, more-recent WarioWare releases. It definitely has room for improvement, but it's still a great construction set.<br/> <br/> Right out of the box, WarioWare DIY presents you with a handful of pre-made games, which you can go ahead and play in a random order. Another tier of pre-made games is unlocked each day for your first several days with the game. This gives you more to do, sure, but their real value lies in your ability to import their artwork into your games, or to look at them in the editing tools to figure out how they were made, which will leave you better informed about how to make better microgames yourself. Also, the game has a great collection of tutorials, the most basic of which is completely mandatory. You won't be able to make games without getting through some hands-on demos of how the tools work. Of course, if you don't go through the tutorials, chances are you'd have no idea where to begin.<br/> <br/> You usually begin with artwork. The DIY Studio offers a decent little paint program that lets you set up the background of your game, draw the moving parts, and animate your objects with up to four frames of animation. It's capable enough to let you zoom in and work on your pieces on a per-pixel basis, and there are grids and guides that you can use for assistance. Personally, I was pretty terrible at the art process, but there's something about awful art that sort of works in the context of WarioWare's weirdness. If that's not good enough, you can also edit the artwork that gets imported from the preset microgames. The only hassle about that process is that you need to remember which game the art you want appeared in, rather than sifting through a list of presets or something like that.<br/> <br/> Your art and animations then get matched up and placed onto the screen, where you start building the behaviors you want, which turns it into an actual game. Setting this stuff up is surprisingly easy, provided you take it slow and work through everything in your head as you go. Setting up the instructions for your objects gives you a series of triggers that, when triggered, touch off a series of actions. So you're essentially setting up a series of IF/THEN statements, like IF this object is tapped, THEN switch the art and make the object travel northeast as quickly as possible. Or IF object A collides with object B, THEN switch object A's \"switch\" on, make the screen shake, and play a sound effect. The catch is that the only interaction you, as a player, can have with the game is via the DS touchscreen. It doesn't seem like it would have made things more complicated to also allow use of the D-pad or buttons, and this would have prevented the kind of lame situations where buttons have to be created as objects and placed on-screen to handle things that the D-pad is perfectly capable of dealing with.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1314925-diy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1314925\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.78387096774194\" data-width=\"620\" style=\"width: 620px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:78.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1314925-diy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1314925\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/26/1314925-diy.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0My homage to greatness.</figcaption></figure>     Sometimes, the toolset can feel a little confining. Since backgrounds can't be animated, you'll have to spend time creating objects and moving them around if you want a little additional motion. For example, I created a driving game and had to then create two objects to serve as the dotted center line down the middle of the road, which needed to move to help simulate movement. It was easy to set up, but it might not be the first thing you think of when it comes time to build it yourself. People who are able to keep the constraints of DIY's tools in mind and then think of creative solutions are the ones that will get the most out of it.<br/> <br/> There's a bit of online functionality in WarioWare DIY, which lets you take two of your games and share them with your friends. Of course, you'll have to go through the whole friend code exchange process for this to work. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a> also has a few free downloadable games up, some of which are made by \"big names,\" like Yoshio Sakamoto and Masahiro Sakurai. There's also a thematic design challenge, where Nintendo asks you to create and submit a game in a specific style (the current one asks for machinery). Those entries will get judged and the best will be made available for everyone to see. That's all fine and good, but what DIY really needs is a full-fledged, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20602\" href=\"/littlebigplanet/3030-20602/\" slug=\"littlebigplanet\">LittleBigPlanet</a>-like level discovery area, with user voting and all of that. As it stands, it's way too difficult to get a large collection of user-made games unless you're sitting around on a message board all day, exchanging friend codes with strangers.<br/> <br/> If you're a fan of playing WarioWare and have no real desire to make your own games, this package is <b>not</b> for you. The simple, touchscreen-only nature of the pre-made games make them a bit of a drag, and, as mentioned above, getting other games is harder than it should be.

Most notably, it's not the sort of broad, sprawling, go-anywhere adventure you used to expect from <a data-ref-id=\"3025-194\" href=\"/final-fantasy/3025-194/\" slug=\"final-fantasy\">Final Fantasy</a>. This was the very first time I'd been allowed to veer slightly left or right of the storyline's stiflingly constrained central path, and even the handful of optional side activities that became available at this late stage of the game weren't nearly enough to offset the thudding need to <i>progress</i> that preceded them.<br/> <br/> The old Final Fantasy games gave you at least a convincing illusion of freedom. Even when the beats of the storyline were plotted out in a straight line, when there was only one location you could realistically visit to advance the game, you still had a sense of a larger world out there waiting to be explored. Not in XIII. Here the designers know exactly which way they want you to go, and that way is always \"forward.\" There's nary a significant detour or side quest to distract you from your singular goal of running from here to there, reaching the yellow icon on the map, and triggering the next cutscene. Would it have killed them to at least connect all these confined locations with a basic overworld? How about an airship to fly around? This is still Final Fantasy, right?<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296223-blindside.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296223\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296223-blindside.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296223\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296223-blindside.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The fast-paced battles are the best thing in the game. It just takes too long before they get interesting. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     It's true that Western and Eastern RPG design sensibilities have diverged dramatically over time; where the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20504\" href=\"/fallout-3/3030-20504/\" slug=\"fallout-3\">Fallouts</a>\u00a0and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20738\" href=\"/dragon-age-origins/3030-20738/\" slug=\"dragon-age-origins\">Dragon Ages</a>\u00a0focus on nameless create-a-characters roaming big open worlds and plotting the paths of their own storylines, the Japanese version of the genre casts you in the roles of iconic characters with their own agendas, with every major decision and crossroads already determined before you start. But Final Fantasy XIII takes this focus to a dangerously reductive extreme, almost losing itself in its relentless devotion to straight-ahead storytelling and nonstop combat. You're either in a battle or watching a cutscene or running to one or the other for most of the game. There just isn't much else to do, and what there <i>is</i> to do isn't always as exciting as it should be.<br/> <br/> The tragedy, or maybe it's the saving grace, of Final Fantasy XIII is that it's eventually a great game if you give it enough time to become one. But it takes longer to pick up momentum and become engaging, mechanically and nararatively, than anyone should have to invest in a game they paid a lot of money for. I stuck it out because I needed to review the game and because I loved Final Fantasy once, and ultimately I'm glad I did. But if it weren't for those two drivers I'd have probably never made it through the first 15 or so hours it takes to see the good part, where the fighting becomes fun and you start to understand the story and care about what happens to its characters.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296235-panic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296235\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296235-panic.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296235\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296235-panic.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296235-panic.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Ditto the storyline.</figcaption></figure>     At this point, you can't possibly be surprised to hear that the story of FFXIII revolves around a ragtag band of rebels brought together by chance to challenge their fate and save the world from certain doom. At least the writers have layered an elaborate fiction on top of this tried-and-true framework, where humans are subject to the whims of a race of enigmatic god-machines called <a data-ref-id=\"3015-4782\" href=\"/falcie/3015-4782/\" slug=\"falcie\">fal'Cie</a> that rule over both a large, dangerous lower world called <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1192\" href=\"/pulse/3035-1192/\" slug=\"pulse\">Pulse</a> and a hovering, idyllic shelter, <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1191\" href=\"/cocoon/3035-1191/\" slug=\"cocoon\">Cocoon</a>. The citizens of each world harbor such deep-seated, irrational fear and resentment for the other that the government of Cocoon at one point practices what amounts to ethnic cleansing, \"purging\" a peaceful group of its own citizens for the crime of haplessly coming into contact with one of the Pulse fal'Cie and maybe, possibly carrying the taint of its evil magic. Naturally, our heroes get tangled up in the machinations of these powerful beings early on, before resolving to take control of their destinies and affect the course of events for the common good.<br/> <br/> Since <a data-ref-id=\"3010-104\" href=\"/square-enix/3010-104/\" slug=\"square-enix\">Square Enix</a> is already working on two more games (<a data-ref-id=\"3030-21848\" href=\"/final-fantasy-agito-xiii/3030-21848/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-agito-xiii\">Agito</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21006\" href=\"/final-fantasy-versus-xiii/3030-21006/\" slug=\"final-fantasy-versus-xiii\">Versus</a>) set in this universe, it's a good thing it's a unique and interesting one, and the story of <i>this</i> game does become quite intriguing as you go along and put together more of the pieces. But the game does a pretty lousy job of communicating all the necessary information to you upfront, leaving you largely in the dark about not just the characters' immediate motivations, but even the basic metaphysical nuts and bolts of how the fal'Cie operate and what it means to be cursed by them. You can't chalk this lack of information up to a reserved style of storytelling, either, since all the necessary pieces are there for you to...sit there and read in the game's massive repository of information about characters, places, events, and everything else that exists in the menu. If the writers had managed to contextualize the essentials of this complex world within the early exposition, it would have made the story a lot more engaging upfront.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296232-nautilas.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296232\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296232-nautilas.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296232\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296232-nautilas.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296232-nautilas.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0XIII is nothing if not beautiful.</figcaption></figure>     The best part of Final Fantasy XIII is the combat, which <i>is</i> successful at reducing unnecessary complexity in favor of broader strategic decisions. Your characters each fit into three of six roles that aren't too different from the classes you'd see in an MMO, with damage-dealers, tanks, healers, and buffers all represented. You can assemble a list of \"paradigms,\" mixes of these classes geared toward different combat scenarios, and then instantly switch from one paradigm to another as often as you want mid-battle. Two of your three characters are controlled entirely by the computer, and even your leader has an optional auto-battle function that lets the AI decide the best course of action for the next few turns. Believe it or not, this automation is actually a good thing; why should you have to manually use ice-specific spells on monsters you already know are weak to ice, every time? The battles are incredibly fast-paced, so once they start to get difficult you <i>need</i> that automated control, anyway; at some point, it's all you can do to swap your paradigms fast enough to keep yourself healed and efficiently deal damage at the same time.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296240-status.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296240\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296240-status.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296240\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296240-status.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296240-status.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The character-development systems are powerful, but too damn complicated. \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     In fact, as the game gets harder and the battles demand more and more of you, you'd be amazed at the elaborate sorts of strategies you can pull off by creatively setting up and switching between paradigms; it's immensely satisfying to start shredding through enemies that previously seemed impossible just because you're getting a better handle on how to exploit the battle system. But just like the storyline, the game takes far too long to roll out all of this complexity, and until it does, it's too easy to be interesting. You don't even earn experience points for the first three or so hours, and you can expect to grind through another dozen at least before it lets you start playing with three characters at once with all the roles available. There's such a great combat engine here, I can't understand why the designers don't let you access all of its potential sooner. The same goes for an incredibly arcane system that lets you upgrade your equipment and apply hidden bonus abilities to your characters. You can achieve some incredibly powerful results with these systems, but their specifics are so obscure and poorly explained, you'd have to hit the Internet and find a FAQ to do so efficiently.<br/> <br/> Final Fantasy XIII just needed to be about half as long as it is, with tighter pacing and a faster ramp up to entertaining combat in its first half. But at least whether it's entertaining or boring you, it's unflinchingly gorgeous from one end to the other. The artists tackle environments as diverse as natural outdoor vistas, high-tech ancient ruins, futuristic space cathedrals, and the gyrating innards of an interdimensonal clock, all with the same zeal for vibrant, saturated colors and inventive architecture. Likewise, the quality of the prerendered video sequences this series has become known for is at a new bar of quality this time around; it's the best-looking CG you'll see this side of a Pixar flick. The soundtrack is also quite good, though it didn't reach the poignant highs and lows for me that some of <a data-ref-id=\"3040-635\" href=\"/nobuo-uematsu/3040-635/\" slug=\"nobuo-uematsu\">Nobuo Uematsu</a>'s work in the older games did (though this game may have the most invigorating boss music of any in the series). And while some of the characters' voiceover can be grating at first, they all settle into their roles as the game trundles along and eventually contribute important pieces to the ongoing drama. In that vein, it's worth mentioning that I thought the quality of the localized English text was uniformly excellent.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296224-change.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296224\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1296224-change.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296224\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296224-change.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1296224-change.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Guy named Cid, check.</figcaption></figure>     The game looks sharp and splendid on the PlayStation 3, and...slightly less splendid on the Xbox 360, where it runs in lower resolution that isn't all that noticeable unless you put the games side by side, when it does become an issue. The prerendered video sequences are fraught with ugly compression artifacts on the Xbox, though, in comparison to the beautifully clean, smooth versions on the PS3 disc. Consider that the PS3 version fits on a single disc while the 360 version requires you to put in new discs periodically, and there is no excuse for playing the Xbox game if you own both consoles. I don't care how much you love achievement points. The side-by-side differences were stark enough that I yanked out the 360 disc at about nine hours in and started over on the PS3. Having finished the game now I'm quite confident that was the right decision.<br/> <br/> I was ready to fall in love with Final Fantasy XIII. My history with the series stretches back over two decades to the NES original and I'd count a couple of those games among my favorite of all time, so if any game could have brought a lapsed fan of Japanese-style RPGs back around again, it was this one. And you know, after that first dozen hours, it kind of did. There are a lot of great things going on in this game--I genuinely loved something about every aspect, from the combat to the story to the visual design. These elements just weren't brought together and exposed as well as they should have been, to do a game of this magnitude the justice it deserves. But if nothing else, the glimmers of excellence in Final Fantasy XIII have at least convinced me that Japanese RPGs, and specifically Final Fantasy itself, haven't quite gasped their last breath just yet. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "Too longwinded and singleminded for its own good, Final Fantasy XIII still delivers a grand, gorgeous adventure...eventually.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-271/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20664/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/final-fantasy-xiii/3030-20664/", "id": 20664, "name": "Final Fantasy XIII"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-04-02 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-72759/", "id": 72759, "name": "Final Fantasy XIII"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/road-fighter-review/1900-272/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6234/1068645-road_fighter.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1068645\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.1428571428571\" data-width=\"224\" style=\"width: 224px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:114.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/6234/1068645-road_fighter.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1068645\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/6234/1068645-road_fighter.png\"></a><figcaption>Fight that road!

Absolutely zero percent of your time with Road Fighter is spent punching and kicking streets into submission. In fact, there's no traditional fighting at all. Road Fighter is a driving game.

There's no chase camera here, no analog control... heck, there isn't even a brake pedal. The original game used a joystick and two buttons--low gear and high gear. You'll start moving by holding the low gear button, then you'll have to swap over to the high gear button to continue accelerating once you've topped out in low. Once you get moving, you'll dodge left and right to avoid traffic and other racers.<br/> <br/> When you tap into another car, you'll start to slide and careen off of the road. It's not an immediate death, so if you quickly let off of the gas and start correcting your course, you can keep moving. Crashing into a tanker truck or the side of the road, though, will blow up your car, which costs you a chunk of fuel. You'll need to get to the end of each course leg before running out of gas in order to refuel and keep moving.

But I'll stop loading you down with dumb references to other games you've probably never heard of. That's the key thing about Jungler: you've probably never seen it before. In a world where the same 25 arcade \"classics\" get released every few years, it's nice to have a little fresh blood on the scene. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-340\" href=\"/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340/\" slug=\"microsoft-game-studios\">Microsoft</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30021\" href=\"/game-room/3030-30021/\" slug=\"game-room\">Game Room</a> has set the stage for Jungler to see a fresh, digital release and it's a decent addition.<br/> <br/> Jungler has its moments, but it's definitely not terrific. You play as a snake-looking \"ship\" that moves around a maze. There are up to four other snake/ships in the maze, as well, and you can fire shots at the enemy ships' tails to reduce their size. If a snake is smaller than yours, it turns green and can be eaten. If it's red, a head-to-head collision will kill you. You'll get the most points by shooting down the enemy snakes until there's nothing left, rather than eating them once they're short enough. Fruit occasionally appears in the maze, as well, which adds a segment to your snake when eaten. Once you've cleared enough snakes, the level ends and the game moves forward to the next level. There are multiple mazes.<br/> <br/> Jungler fits into the Game Room challenge and leaderboard system pretty well. Like most arcade games of its era, it's a very score-focused game, and it gets tough after a few levels, giving you plenty of opportunities to set up late-game survival challenges that are actually challenging. But the simplistic nature of the game--and I'm talking about its simplicity compared to other Game Room releases here--makes it fall flat a little sooner than some of the other available games.<br/> <br/> If you've managed to start a cult of hardcore Jungalos and you know you'll get a lot of hot and heavy challenge action out of them, Jungler's definitely worthwhile.

While I'd guess that stalwart Splinter Cell fans might find this new approach to be a bit more simplified and straightforward than they're used to, the end result is a very modern-feeling game that falls more in line with other stealth-optional action games than with its own legacy.<br/> <br/> The story finds Sam Fisher out of the professional espionage game. His daughter is dead and he's got no reason to go on other than finding revenge. As he tracks down someone he suspects is associated with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-902\" href=\"/sarah-fisher/3005-902/\" slug=\"sarah-fisher\">Sarah Fisher</a>'s demise, Sam is quickly roped back into <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3230\" href=\"/national-security-agency/3015-3230/\" slug=\"national-security-agency\">Third Echelon's</a>\u00a0business. It seems that since his time there, the agency has fallen under the leadership of some extremely conniving individuals, who are scheming to do some very bad stuff on American soil. Under the promise of learning more about his daughter, Fisher sets out on a new mission. With its heavy focus on a former agent going up against his old colleagues and the civilian look that Fisher sports throughout the game, Conviction\u00a0feels more like something out of the <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2397\" href=\"/jason-bourne/3005-2397/\" slug=\"jason-bourne\">Jason Bourne</a> playbook than a Splinter Cell game. Swap out Fisher's family-related rage for Matt Damon's identity-seeking Bourne and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2572\" href=\"/anna-grimsdottir/3005-2572/\" slug=\"anna-grimsdottir\">Anna \"Grim\" Grimsd\u00f3tt\u00edr</a> for Joan Allen's Pamela Landy and you'd hardly notice the difference.<br/> <br/> Comparisons aside, the story of Splinter Cell: Conviction is more than enough to keep you moving through the adventure, which will probably take most players somewhere around seven hours to complete. The twists are, ultimately, pretty predictable, but most of the performances are solid and the environments you're sent through, which range from government buildings to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1733\" href=\"/iraq/3035-1733/\" slug=\"iraq\">Gulf War</a> flashbacks, have a nice variety to them. Throughout the entire game, though, your goal is to get from point A to point B, and the game usually doesn't care about how you get there. If you're sneaky enough to creep around your opposition, that's fine. In fact, there are a couple of spots in the game where detection leads to a failure and restart. But for the most part, this game is about Sam Fisher hiding behind cover, popping out to shoot a bad guy or two in the face with a silenced pistol, then creeping to another spot of cover to do it again. When you're spotted, the enemies head in your direction, and the game uses a cool \"last known position\" system to show an outline of where the enemies think you are. This lets you set up situations where you flank around to the side, giving you clear shots while the dopes head right for where they last saw you, rather than assuming that you'd continue to be on the move and behaving a little more carefully.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3507/1301773-screenshot_x360_splinter_cell_conviction063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1301773\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3507/1301773-screenshot_x360_splinter_cell_conviction063.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1301773\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/3507/1301773-screenshot_x360_splinter_cell_conviction063.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Objectives are projected onto the environment, which is a pretty neat little trick.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     There's also a powerful \"mark and execute\" system, which is a sort of supermove that lets you tag a handful of enemies (the number increases with certain weapons and by buying some upgrades) and automatically shoot them all, one right after the other. To prevent this from breaking the game, you can only perform the execution move after you've killed one guy via a melee attack. Also, you can only store up one execute at a time, so melee killing an entire room doesn't let you cruise through the rest of the level on auto-pilot. Obviously, from a balance perspective, there needs to be some kind of limit on how frequently you can automatically bag a room full of bad guys. But from the \"reality\" side of things, having to melee kill someone first doesn't really make any sense. Perhaps Fisher can only pull off multiple headshots after he's tasted the blood of his victims? Whatever. It's not the end of the world, but the game takes itself pretty seriously from start to finish, so this weird requirement sort of stands out as pretty silly.<br/> <br/> By the end of the game, you'll have acquired quite an arsenal of EMP <a data-ref-id=\"3055-111\" href=\"/grenade/3055-111/\" slug=\"grenade\">grenades</a>, remote cameras, an assortment of fully <a data-ref-id=\"3055-413\" href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" slug=\"assault-rifle\">automatic rifles</a>, and so on. But most of it feels unnecessary. While you can go through guns blazing, careful use of a silenced pistol remains the most accurate and effective way to move through the game. Most of the submachine guns and assault rifles feel wildly inaccurate by comparison, so there's really no need to employ them except in the rare couple of cases where a room you're in gets flooded by alert enemy soldiers. For the most part, Fisher's weapon collection feels slightly more effective on the multiplayer side of things.<br/> <br/> The same weapon selection you have in the single-player game, and whatever upgrades you've purchased for those weapons, carries over to the other modes. These are the multiplayer modes, where a total of two players can go through a quick cooperative campaign, complete with its own story and agents. These agents also factor into the other modes, which have you\u00a0protect an area from waves of enemies, work your way through the map to hunt down AI enemies, or go up against one another in \"face-off\" mode. This is a big departure from the multiplayer found in the last Splinter Cell game, but it's nice because it sticks to the series' strengths and uses the same mechanics that also work in the single-player. You can also play some of the modes by yourself, and there's an offline split-screen mode that you can use for multiplayer, if you like.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1269046-scc4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1269046\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1200\" style=\"width: 1200px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1269046-scc4.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1269046\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1269046-scc4.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1269046-scc4.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The game's twists keep you wondering who you're really working for right up to the end.</figcaption></figure>     Visually, Splinter Cell: Conviction usually looks pretty nice. You'll catch the occasional rough texture here and there, and some of the transitions between animations don't line up quite right on a few of the melee kills. But things like running and sliding into cover, or hanging upside-down from a pipe while shooting at your opponents look pretty cool. Most of the voice cast is decent, but the enemies sound like idiots when they're looking for you, with some of them repeating the same or extremely similar lines of dialogue while sniffing you out. Sam Fisher himself, once again voiced by <a data-ref-id=\"3040-61907\" href=\"/michael-ironside/3040-61907/\" slug=\"michael-ironside\">Michael Ironside</a>, often sounds a little off. While some of that makes storyline sense--Fisher's meant to be a few years out of the game and mentally unstable due to the loss of his daughter, after all--some of his lines come off a little slurred, like someone was stashing a little <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3164\" href=\"/wine/3055-3164/\" slug=\"wine\">wine</a> in the voiceover booth.<br/> <br/> Splinter Cell: Conviction is the most accessible Splinter Cell game yet. It gives you the firepower to shoot your way out of your mistakes, but also makes the stealth side of things fun, rewarding, and significantly easier than just attempting to run around and shoot. Its only serious issue is that it doesn't feel especially substantial or replayable. The multiplayer is a nice touch, but most players will probably see all of the content once and find little reason to return.", "deck": "Conviction modernizes Splinter Cell's stealth-action formula in a lot of ways, and it's partnered with a quality story that makes playing it worth your while.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-274/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20464/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/tom-clancys-splinter-cell-conviction/3030-20464/", "id": 20464, "name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-04-13 09:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84245/", "id": 84245, "name": "Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell: Conviction (Collector's Edition)"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/final-fight-double-impact-review/1900-275/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1302636-ffdi_ff_08_cabinet_monitor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1302636\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1302636-ffdi_ff_08_cabinet_monitor.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1302636\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1302636-ffdi_ff_08_cabinet_monitor.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Yes.

What it lacks in sheer bulk (it's only got <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6722\" href=\"/final-fight/3030-6722/\" slug=\"final-fight\">Final Fight</a> and, randomly, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4325\" href=\"/magic-sword/3030-4325/\" slug=\"magic-sword\">Magic Sword</a>), it more than makes up for with a deeply infectious reverence for all the minutiae of the arcade experience.<br/> <br/> Everything is spot-on. Both games are here in their entirety, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-136\" href=\"/poison/3005-136/\" slug=\"poison\">hookers</a> and all. One of the graphics filters reproduces the soft edges, phosphor glow, and slight curvature of the old CRT monitors they used in '80s machines. You can play either game framed by a perfect reproduction of its cabinet art, controls and everything. Double Impact was obviously made by some people who <i>really</i> love old arcade games. It's glorious.<br/> <br/> Of course, as much as you want to wax nostalgic about Final Fight and its musclebound mayor <a data-ref-id=\"3005-171\" href=\"/mike-haggar/3005-171/\" slug=\"mike-haggar\">Mike Haggar</a>, it's still just an old-school beat-'em-up. That means a lot of walking from left to right, hammering on the attack button, and occasionally busting open a barrel or crate to devour the health-restoring roast chicken concealed within. Magic Sword's fantasy hack-and-slash is similarly one-trick, and though it's merely a side-scroller, it at least gives you different weapons and allies to fight with through its 50 levels. The point is, it's great to stroll alongside these games down memory lane for a couple of hours, but they aren't deep enough to support repeated playthroughs anymore. But for $10, you might not need them to.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1302629-01_ffdi_ff_menu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1302629\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1302629-01_ffdi_ff_menu.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1302629\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1302629-01_ffdi_ff_menu.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0Nothing says \"love letter\" like fake arcade cabinets.</figcaption></figure>     Double Impact's presentation does everything you'd want, and the backend features hold up their end of the deal too. There are checkpoints in both games so you can pick up where you left off, and every manner of two-player play is in here: local, online, and even a jump-in matchmaking mode that drops you into the game of a random online player. (That mode can be slightly shaky when you first join a game but quickly stabilizes and makes for a smooth experience.)<br/> <br/> Maybe the best addition is the Vault, which ties into the in-game achievements/trophies but extends well beyond them with extra challenges like \"beat this game using less than 18 continues\" or \"finish every level with <a data-ref-id=\"3005-257\" href=\"/guy/3005-257/\" slug=\"guy\">Guy</a>.\" Some of these goals are pretty rough, and make you realize how intently old arcade games devoted themselves to the goal of making you pump quarter ad nauseam.

There are plenty of returning characters and callbacks to events from the first two seasons, but neither the story nor the puzzles really hinge on details that aren't presented or reiterated within the episode. The game also comes equipped with an auto-hint system that will also do some aggressive handholding if you let it, features that make it fairly suitable for players unfamiliar with the characters, and those without a sharp sense for adventure game puzzles.<br/> <br/>   Aside from all the ridiculous, voluminous premise, what really jumped out at me in the opening minutes of the episode was the presentation. The Telltale adventure games have always had a certain chunky charm to them. A low-key cartoony style still carries here, but it's lent some depth by more sophisticated lighting and a decent film-grain effect. The camera angles can even get a little jazzy from time to time, though not so aggressively that it jams up navigation too often. Regardless, the graphical upgrades make Sam &amp; Max look fresh again.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/37219/1297771-sammax6.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1297771\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56230529595016\" data-width=\"642\" style=\"width: 642px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/37219/1297771-sammax6.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1297771\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/37219/1297771-sammax6.png\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0I dunno Max, something about you just looks... different.</figcaption></figure>     While still a generally conventional adventure game that relies on lots of punchy dialogue and bizarre-yet-logical item interaction, a lot of the puzzles in The Penal Zone <b>[EDITOR'S NOTE: pfft!]</b> focus on the abilities Max gains from two toys he acquires early on. One is a View-Master that lets him see a vision of the future; the other a toy telephone that lets Sam and Max teleport to a person's location, provided they know that person's phone number.<br/> <br/>   There are lots of time-travel gags baked into the whole future-vision ability, which can make for some fun, circuitous logic, though as a side-effect, you also end up hearing lots of repeated dialogue as you make Max's visions a reality. It's funny a couple times, but eventually you realize the last thing any adventure game needs is more repeating dialogue. Still, it lands enough of its gags that it's a minor point, getting good mileage out of self-aware nods to the episodic format and adventure game conventions and absurd wordplay.<br/> <br/>    Telltale brings its A-game with The Penal Zone <b>[EDITOR'S NOTE: bwah!]</b> and it's a strong start for the season. It clearly establishes a repeating theme of Max gaining and then exploiting ridiculous new psychic powers with each episode, something that, if the quality of the execution stays where it is, should make for a fun season. Of course, the catch here is that, other than the iPad version, which has some tragic frame rate issues, both the PSN and PC versions of The Devil's Playhouse require you to invest in the full season up-front. It's a bit of a gamble for first-timers, but fans of the series and the genre should have little to worry about.", "deck": "Telltale sets up its third season with some slick presentation, a few new gameplay tricks, and enough lightly absurdist, self-aware gags to keep the adventure brisk.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-276/", "platforms": "PC, PlayStation Network (PS3), Mac", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-30008/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/sam-max-episode-301-the-penal-zone/3030-30008/", "id": 30008, "name": "Sam & Max Episode 301: The Penal Zone"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-04-17 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-91121/", "id": 91121, "name": "Sam & Max Episode 301: The Penal Zone"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/super-street-fighter-iv-review/1900-277/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48222/1296079-hakan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296079\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.4697265625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:47.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/4/48222/1296079-hakan.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1296079\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/4/48222/1296079-hakan.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Hakan will oil up and destroy you.</figcaption></figure>     If you are still interested in playing <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20456\" href=\"/street-fighter-iv/3030-20456/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iv\">Street Fighter IV</a>, it's worth your time and money to upgrade to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-28437\" href=\"/super-street-fighter-iv/3030-28437/\" slug=\"super-street-fighter-iv\">Super Street Fighter IV</a>, an updated version of the game that adds 10 new characters, new backgrounds, a new announcer, new moves for every character, and a light coat of rebalancing that might only be noticeable if you're extremely serious about fighting games. The online mode is still the star of the show, and the options available for Internet-based fighters have been streamlined in some ways and expanded in others. While you'll probably notice a few spots here and there that could have been better, the game's $40 price tag ends up making SSFIV feel like a terrific value that anyone with even a passing interest in fighting games should be able to get into on some level.<br/> <br/> SSFIV even makes some attempts to help lesser players get better by giving you way more opportunities to watch other players fight. The new Endless Battle mode is essentially a better name for \"Quarter Match,\" and it allows up to eight players to get in and fight forever--two players throw down while the rest of the players watch and wait for their turn to fight the winner. The game also has a new \"replay channel\" option that lets you view other online battles, as well as the ability to save any match you're watching for later viewing. The last 30 of your own fights are even saved automatically, giving you ample time to study or, if you like, save them.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1343438-ssfivtourneyscreen_7e.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1343438\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1343438-ssfivtourneyscreen_7e.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1343438\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1343438-ssfivtourneyscreen_7e.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Juri has a lot of basic but effective attacks that should help new players feel at ease.</figcaption></figure>     Once you've saved replays, you can invite other players to connect to you and chat while watching replays. However, the whole system lacks a proper search function. So if you're, for example, trying to find the world's greatest <a data-ref-id=\"3005-271\" href=\"/e-honda/3005-271/\" slug=\"e-honda\">E. Honda</a> players and glean a few tips from the way they fight, the best you can do is either sift through a short list of the latest replays and hunt for a Honda icon or pick the \"originals\" option, which only shows replays that have at least one of the original eight World Warriors in them. There are other channels for the characters that come from the Alpha series, boss characters, and so on. It's a neat idea, but it'd be a lot more useful if you could set some search parameters like \"show me all of the Honda matches where Honda beats <a data-ref-id=\"3005-102\" href=\"/sagat/3005-102/\" slug=\"sagat\">Sagat</a>\" or something like that. With the right tools in place, this could have been an entire Street Fighter-themed social network. Instead, it's a fun curiosity that should have been more useful.<br/> <br/> The single-player game hasn't changed much. You can still mash <a data-ref-id=\"3005-6\" href=\"/zangief/3005-6/\" slug=\"zangief\">Zangief</a>'s lariat over and over again to beat the AI on its hardest difficulty setting, and even if you aren't just spinning your way to free achievements or trophies, it's not the sort of thing you'll want to stick with for any serious length of time. The great news is that, unless you're fiending over achievements, you don't really need to touch the single-player at all, because all of the game's characters are unlocked from the get-go. As you select fighters in any mode, you'll unlock their additional costume colors and taunts. So jumping online with reckless abandon--or at least just limiting your single-player experience to the training and challenge modes--is probably the way to go. All you'll miss are some new rival battle exchanges for the new fighters and some mostly lackluster opening and ending videos.<br/> <br/> Aside from the Endless Battle mode, SSFIV also has a team battle option, where two teams of up to four players can fight it out. The winning player stays on to fight the opposing team's next player, leading to potential one-character victory situations where one player runs through an entire team by himself. There are also ranked matches, which have been streamlined to get you into a game more quickly, instead of presenting you with potential choices for opponents, all of whom invariably get matched up with other opponents while you're still staring at the list. The online performance seems to be just fine, as it was in the previous game.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27212/1275385-dudley3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275385\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27212/1275385-dudley3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275385\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27212/1275385-dudley3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27212/1275385-dudley3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>The training room is a great place to keep it classy.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     The game's 10 new characters come from all over the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-331\" href=\"/street-fighter/3025-331/\" slug=\"street-fighter\">Street Fighter universe</a>, and they include two brand-new characters that already feel like a lot more fun than the four new fighters introduced in the previous arcade release. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-12558\" href=\"/juri/3005-12558/\" slug=\"juri\">Juri</a> is a lithe little lady with a speedy mid-air dash kick and some ground-based flip kicks that make her fast and fun to use. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-14296\" href=\"/hakan/3005-14296/\" slug=\"hakan\">Hakan</a> is the exact opposite, a big grappler with crazy ultras and the ability to oil himself up, which makes him a more effective fighter for a brief period of time. Figuring out when to apply oil without getting hit is tricky, but Hakan's wild techniques are worth the effort.<br/> <br/> The other eight characters represent other eras in Street Fighter history, and include a trio of <a data-ref-id=\"3025-1662\" href=\"/street-fighter-iii/3025-1662/\" slug=\"street-fighter-iii\">Street Fighter III</a> fighters. While I'll probably never truly figure out what makes <a data-ref-id=\"3005-888\" href=\"/makoto/3005-888/\" slug=\"makoto\">Makoto</a> tick, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3107\" href=\"/dudley/3005-3107/\" slug=\"dudley\">Dudley</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-3109\" href=\"/ibuki/3005-3109/\" slug=\"ibuki\">Ibuki</a> are fun inclusions. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-257\" href=\"/guy/3005-257/\" slug=\"guy\">Guy</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-319\" href=\"/cody-travers/3005-319/\" slug=\"cody-travers\">Cody</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2218\" href=\"/adon/3005-2218/\" slug=\"adon\">Adon</a> represent the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-960\" href=\"/street-fighter-alpha/3025-960/\" slug=\"street-fighter-alpha\">Alpha</a> series nicely, even if I'll never be able to accept Cody's \"bored prisoner\" character. The other two New Challengers from <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6665\" href=\"/super-street-fighter-ii/3030-6665/\" slug=\"super-street-fighter-ii\">Super Street Fighter II</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-46\" href=\"/t-hawk/3005-46/\" slug=\"t-hawk\">T.Hawk</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-4154\" href=\"/dee-jay/3005-4154/\" slug=\"dee-jay\">Dee Jay</a>, round out the cast. Between Hakan and Zangief, I feel like the grappler quota is already well-filled, though Dee Jay's cross-ups are still in effect.<br/> <br/> The new characters bring the total up to 35 fighters, which is a healthy number. Each character has been given a light once-over with balancing issues in mind, and every character now has an additional ultra attack. Like Street Fighter III's super art select, you'll pick which ultra you want before heading into battle. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-103\" href=\"/ryu/3005-103/\" slug=\"ryu\">Ryu</a>'s new second ultra, the Metsu Shoryuken, is really just a big-ass dragon punch... but the visual effects and sound design for it blow away almost everything else in the entire game. It's an amazing move that looks and sounds like the victim's just going to explode or something. There are a couple of other visually striking (and even more extremely useful) new ultras in the game, but Ryu II takes the cake. Most of the others, new and old, pale in comparison.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27212/1275393-makoto_alt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275393\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"480\" style=\"width: 480px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/27212/1275393-makoto_alt.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275393\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27212/1275393-makoto_alt.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/27212/1275393-makoto_alt.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0New players (or people who didn't spend a lot of time with SFIII) might find Makoto's moves tough to comprehend.</figcaption></figure>     Other parts of the game's presentation have been redone, as well. There's a new fight announcer, a lot of new (and great) music, and a whole new batch of titles and icons to unlock as you fight. There are some great new backgrounds, too, including a <a data-ref-id=\"3035-51\" href=\"/metro-city/3035-51/\" slug=\"metro-city\">Metro City</a>-themed stage and another that takes place during a solar eclipse. Also, on that particular stage, hippos wander up as the fight continues, and they look on as you pound each other. While the graphics haven't been completely overhauled or anything like that, Super Street Fighter IV is still a great-looking game.<br/> <br/> On top of all that, SSFIV comes with a nice, full-color manual that does a respectable job at teaching brand-new players the basics, from what the buttons do to the concept of canceling one move into another. However, there's still a big, tutorial-shaped hole in Street Fighter IV. You're left with the impression that if the challenge mode would just show you what it's asking you to do before you do it, or if there was some even more basic training that would show players how to properly use focus attacks and dash cancels, more introductory players would go on to become better, smarter street fighters. Of course, a fighting game is only fun if you're matched up with like-minded, similarly skilled opposition, and in this respect, the game seems to be able to help you have fun, regardless of your skill level. SSFIV makes last year's fighting game a lot better, and it does it at a less-than-full retail price. Like I said up top, if you've got any interest in fighting games at all, Super Street Fighter IV is a killer deal.", "deck": "Super Street Fighter IV adds enough great new content to justify skipping over the \"Champion Edition\" and \"Hyper Fighting\" steps in the Street Fighter upgrade path.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-277/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-28437/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/super-street-fighter-iv/3030-28437/", "id": 28437, "name": "Super Street Fighter IV"}, "score": 5, "publish_date": "2010-04-26 08:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-87247/", "id": 87247, "name": "Super Street Fighter IV"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/dead-to-rights-retribution-review/1900-278/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1211295-ss_519602_0203_011209_copy_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1211295\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5859375\" data-width=\"4096\" style=\"width: 4096px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1211295-ss_519602_0203_011209_copy_noscale.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1211295\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1211295-ss_519602_0203_011209_copy_noscale.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Your dog can rip out throats and testicles, with the latter netting you an achievement or trophy.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25286\" href=\"/dead-to-rights-retribution/3030-25286/\" slug=\"dead-to-rights-retribution\">Dead To Rights: Retribution</a>\u00a0hits the same basic beats as past games in the series, but this isn't a direct sequel to the previous games in the line. As before, this game is all about the combat skills of\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3005-12816\" href=\"/jack-slate/3005-12816/\" slug=\"jack-slate\">Jack Slate</a>\u00a0of the\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3035-2628\" href=\"/grant-city/3035-2628/\" slug=\"grant-city\">Grant City</a>\u00a0Police Department and his dog, Shadow. The combination of melee attacks, third-person gunplay, and the occasional dog attack stand out a bit in today's world of pure, cover-based third-person shooters. But DTR is so rough around its edges that any sort of PS2-era nostalgia you might feel while playing it is nullified by awkward animation and very repetitive action.<br/><br/>As a reset of the Dead To Rights fiction, Jack Slate starts out without his dog at his side. At the outset, Shadow belongs to Frank Slate, Jack's father. But when the city's gangs start getting organized and start massing firepower that is way beyond their means, the already-burned-out Grant City turns into a huge war zone. Before long, that dog is under your control. The particulars of the story and its twists and turns aren't especially unique, but they stay out of the way enough to let you focus on the action. The game utilizes plenty of voice acting to keep things moving, both in and out of cutscenes. For the most part, the presentation is decent.<br/><br/>The bulk of the action in DTR is a cross between <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears</a>-like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-55\" href=\"/cover-system/3015-55/\" slug=\"cover-system\">cover mechanics</a> and up-close punches and kicks. The shooting is mostly fine, with a pretty good variety of weapons that gives you new things to mess around with every couple of hours. But ammunition is frequently limited, leaving you to pick up guns off of your enemies (usually with a disarm move that lets you take someone's gun and shoot them with it) or rely on your fists to get the job done. The melee combat has a basic combo system, including grabs and a guard-crushing attack to get past defensive foes. The melee has its place, but since shots to the head end up being the fastest way to dispose of any obstacles you encounter, staying armed is a better move. Later on, you'll end up getting attacked by a few enemies at a time, making the melee attacks even riskier, though setting someone up for a takedown attack triggers a lengthy (and often lame-looking) kill sequence that gives you a bit of breathing room. Taking down enemies also fills a focus meter, which can be used as a\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3015-1323\" href=\"/slow-motion/3015-1323/\" slug=\"slow-motion\">bullet time</a>\u00a0effect. Unlike some other implementations of this system, you don't need a full meter to activate it, and you can turn it off at any time. Careful metering of your focus ability gives you the ability to effectively clear a room at will, provided you're a decent shot.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/931980-dead_to_rights_retribution_xbox_360screenshots23456dtr_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-931980\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5859375\" data-width=\"4096\" style=\"width: 4096px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:58.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/931980-dead_to_rights_retribution_xbox_360screenshots23456dtr_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-931980\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/931980-dead_to_rights_retribution_xbox_360screenshots23456dtr_04.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Tossing guys over the edge is a fast and effective way to clear the path ahead.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     For those times when Slate's back is really up against the wall, you can call your dog into action with basic attack and defend commands. Shadow can topple and kill most foes, but occasionally he'll only be able to distract them, which still gives you plenty of room to finish the job yourself. There are also a few levels where you take direct control of Shadow. These are usually stealth sequences where the dog needs to get past a collection of patrolling enemies or kill them, hopefully without alerting the other guards. You can drag bodies out of the way to help maintain secrecy, but the animation for this looks awful. Shadow \"drags\" the ragdolled dead body around, but there's no actual connection between Shadow's mouth and the body. It's nice to have the stealth sequences around to break up the monotony of the game's regular combat, but the dog portions aren't especially exciting or difficult.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest issue with Dead To Rights: Retribution is that it feels like last generation's ideas and standards reanimated for a new set of consoles. Playing through this single-player-only game once is a decent time, but you'll probably find yourself bored before the game's conclusion, and there's no sort of cooperative mode or anything like that to help players find alternate ways to play. It looks and feels like a cleaned-up PlayStation 2 game. While that certainly gives it a weird sort of throwback charm, it's difficult to justify paying $59.99 for something so archaic. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "Dead To Rights: Retribution has its moments, but its generic, last-generation feel makes it a tough purchase to justify at full price.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-278/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-25286/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/dead-to-rights-retribution/3030-25286/", "id": 25286, "name": "Dead to Rights: Retribution"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-04-27 14:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-90474/", "id": 90474, "name": "Dead to Rights: Retribution"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/alan-wake-review/1900-279/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1363206-alanwake_29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363206\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1363206-alanwake_29.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363206\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1363206-alanwake_29.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The flashlight is Wake's best friend.</figcaption></figure>     Artful storytelling and imposing darkness collide with dramatic force in the Xbox 360-exclusive action game <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20982\" href=\"/alan-wake/3030-20982/\" slug=\"alan-wake\"> Alan Wake</a>. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-1961\" href=\"/remedy-entertainment-ltd/3010-1961/\" slug=\"remedy-entertainment-ltd\"> Remedy</a>'s first original effort since <a data-ref-id=\"3025-515\" href=\"/max-payne/3025-515/\" slug=\"max-payne\"> Max Payne</a> trades heavily in densely creepy forests, small-town mystique, and no small amount of third-person shooting. The game weaves a powerful narrative web around a core third-person action model that's largely satisfying even when its lack of variety becomes apparent in the later stages of the game. Even a thousand plaid-wearing axemen aren't enough to slow the driving momentum of these uncanny events, or make the game's foreboding forests one iota less unsettling.<br/> <br/> The eponymous lead character certainly isn't your typical video game hero. Wake is a wildly popular Stephen King-esque horror writer whose three-year bout with writer's block has lead him and his wife Alice in search of creative inspiration, taking them from a posh Manhattan condo to the sleepy Pacific Northwestern logging town of Bright Falls. The couple has scarcely arrived in town and checked into their cabin before Wake finds himself abruptly short one wife and one whole week's worth of events in his memory. In exchange he finds plenty of terror, courtesy of a pervasive dark being that's moved into town and targeted him for reasons that become clearer as the game wears on.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1363207-alan_wake_apr_2010_combat_013.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363207\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1363207-alan_wake_apr_2010_combat_013.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363207\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1363207-alan_wake_apr_2010_combat_013.png\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Darkness can take many forms.</figcaption></figure>     Wake's journey to uncover the fate of his wife, the secrets of <a data-ref-id=\"3035-610\" href=\"/bright-falls/3035-610/\" slug=\"bright-falls\"> Bright Falls</a>, and his own importance to the dark presence provides the game's narrative impetus, and Remedy uses an internal episodic format to expertly delegate the flow of the mystery from one scene to the next. The natural breakpoint at the ending of each episode gives the writers ample opportunity to mete out pieces of the story slowly and control the falling and rising action, building to a crescendo right before the \"credits\" roll, just like a serialized television drama. Each episode ended with a \"holy crap\" sort of cliffhanger that made me eager to plunge ahead and make sense of newly revealed information. But a couple of times I found greater value in making myself turn the game off and stewing over what had just happened for a bit before returning to continue. This isn't the \"episodic\" sort of gaming you're used to, but it's a great way to tell a story in a video game.<br/> <br/> He might sit behind a word processor during the day, but Wake sure knows how to handle a revolver. And a shotgun, a hunting rifle, a flare gun, and flashbang grenades. Those are your tools against the demonic residents of Bright Falls who are \"taken\" by the dark thing infesting their town and turned against Alan Wake and his efforts to find Alice and get the hell out of Dodge. The game has that unusual combination of loose, free character movement and fast but precise aiming control that to me defines the best third-person shooters. No twiddling of sensitivity settings required. Other than a few wonky jumps from time to time, Remedy's pedigree as a maker of action games is plainly evident here.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1363209-alanwake_51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363209\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1363209-alanwake_51.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363209\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1363209-alanwake_51.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1363209-alanwake_51.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0It will take you most of the game to find out what the heck is going on in Bright Falls.</figcaption></figure>     Under and around the shooting, Alan Wake's gameplay revolves around the contrast between the darkness of its antagonists and the light from literally any source you can get your hands on. Flashlights, road flares, spotlights, headlights--anything that provides illumination is a potential weapon to stave off the encroaching shadows. The enemies are swathed in a tangible darkness that shields them from your attacks until you literally burn it off of them with a light source, and aside from your handy flashlight, the game finds some neat opportunities to arm you with heftier firepower (lightpower?) as found in the environment. Conversely, some of the best tension comes from the moments when ammo is scarce or nonexistent and you're left to dash from one light to another in an attempt to escape the gloom.<br/> <br/> There's a lot of gloom. Bright Falls and its dense forests form a supporting character all by themselves. Remedy does the forest primeval <i>really</i> well; the outdoor areas are packed with stifling foliage and dense fog, the tension rises along with fast-moving shadows, and ambient sounds heighten dread and obscure the movements of your enemies. These guys understand the simple value of silhouetting a crazed maniac with an axe against a misty, backlit tree line, though they find ways to arrange plenty of more complex but equally creepy scenarios. Alan Wake is a disturbingly great-looking game from top to bottom.<br/> <br/> The game is also relentlessly linear, though, a price I feel like you have to pay for that kind of tightly packed design. You can rarely stray far from the critical path, and there isn't much to do on either side other than find a huge host of collectibles. There are scores of coffee thermoses hidden around for the achievement-seeking completists, but there are also just as many mysterious manuscript pages strewn around that <i>do</i> tie into the story. Each one foreshadows events to come or clarifies those that have already passed, and these are well worth seeking out as an enhancement to the game experience itself.\u00a0\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1363211-alanwake_46.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363211\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1363211-alanwake_46.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1363211\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1363211-alanwake_46.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1363211-alanwake_46.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Lots of little touches round out the unusual atmosphere.</figcaption></figure>     Similarly, the game gets a tasteful amount of mileage from the authorial nature of its protagonist, with frequent descriptive voiceover narration that's just ham-handed enough to sound like it's ripped right from the pages of one of Wake's own bestsellers. You'll find some references to King, Alfred Hitchcock, and other masters of the macabre in here as well. And of course, Remedy also gets in one of its signature touches with a series of operable television shows that display full mini-episodes of a fantastic fake <i>Twilight Zone</i> program, and there's a pitch-perfect small-town AM radio host who you'll hear provide color to the events and the area as you move through the story.\u00a0<br/> <br/> Alan Wake isn't an overly long game at maybe a dozen hours, but in the last quarter or so I found a sort of fatigue set in with what I was doing. It might be the very limited variety of enemies you face; there are only four or five types repeated almost ad nauseam throughout the game. Or maybe it speaks to the storyline's high level of intrigue that I just wanted to get on with the combat so I could uncover the next wild piece of the mystery. Earlier in the game, the nighttime action is broken up by expository daytime sequences that almost feel like an adventure game, but the pacing suffers a lack of brevity in its last couple of hours. A more condensed final act would have wrapped this package up a little tighter.<br/> <br/> That's small potatoes in the grand scheme, though. Alan Wake is on the whole a propulsive, thrilling, and downright spooky action game from start to finish, quite unlike anything else on the market in visual style and storytelling format. It might take Remedy forever and a day to get from one game to the next, but Alan Wake proves once again their toil is well worth the wait.\u00a0", "deck": "Remedy's troubled horror writer deftly balances solid shooting and ominous atmosphere in his great Xbox 360 debut.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-279/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-20982/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/alan-wake/3030-20982/", "id": 20982, "name": "Alan Wake"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-05-04 23:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84077/", "id": 84077, "name": "Alan Wake"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/picross-3d-review/1900-280/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1253435-32_image100113_1052_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1253435\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"544\" style=\"width: 544px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1253435-32_image100113_1052_000.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1253435\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1450/1253435-32_image100113_1052_000.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The numbers on the cubes are the key to figuring out which blocks stay and which blocks go.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo</a>'s Picross games mostly stayed in Japan, but <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6316\" href=\"/marios-picross/3030-6316/\" slug=\"marios-picross\">Mario's Picross</a> for the Game Boy was enough to get me hooked on this type of logic-based number puzzle. If you're not familiar with it, it's easiest to say that it resembles Sudoku with the way you must take a logic-based approach to completing \"picture crosswords.\" Nintendo released <a data-ref-id=\"3030-19050\" href=\"/picross-ds/3030-19050/\" slug=\"picross-ds\">Picross DS</a> back in 2007, which continued on in much the same way. But <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23984\" href=\"/picross-3d/3030-23984/\" slug=\"picross-3d\">Picross 3D</a>, as you might ascertain from its name, is different. It takes the same basic idea from the flat, 2D Picross puzzle and applies it to collections of cubes. The extra dimension packs in a lot of extra challenge, too, making this collection of over 350 puzzles a great, long-lasting choice for anyone looking for DS-based puzzles.<br/> <br/> Before you can solve puzzles on your own, you'll need to know the rules of the game. Essentially, you're chipping away cubes that don't belong while marking the ones that do, and you'll eventually form some sort of object. Numbers on the sides of the cubes clue you in about which ones are which, and you'll have employ your powers of deduction to come to the right answer. While it seems extremely complicated at first, Picross 3D breaks each facet of play down into its own tutorial segment. Between learning new techniques and then trying them out yourself, you'll probably spend the first 30 or 45 minutes just getting up to speed. No one rule is especially tricky or difficult to understand on its own, and the pace sets you up and teaches you the rules really well. Once you're turned loose, the game simply presents you with one puzzle after another, broken out into levels, which are further broken out into difficulties.<br/> <br/> As you chip away at blocks and form identifiable objects out of them, you'll be racing against the clock and attempting to avoid mistakes. Completing puzzles quickly earns you one bonus star, while completing a puzzle without making any errors earns you another. Stars are used to unlock bonus puzzles, which appear at the end of each normal level. Whenever you complete a puzzle, the revealed object colors in and animates a bit. So you'll see a whistle make a blowing animation, or a flip-style cell phone flip open and shut a few times. It's a minor addition that makes completing a puzzle feel like a bit more of an accomplishment.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1253455-52_image100113_1305_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1253455\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"544\" style=\"width: 544px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1253455-52_image100113_1305_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1253455\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1450/1253455-52_image100113_1305_001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The block colors don't appear until you've completed the puzzle.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     Though there's a bit of time-related pressure in Picross 3D, the game definitely lets you play at your own pace with a quick save option that lets you quickly get out of a puzzle in case you need to turn your DS off. Of course, the DS' built-in sleep mode works pretty well for this, too.<br/> <br/> There's some basic online functionality in place to let you download regular puzzle updates from Nintendo, as well as upload puzzles you make in the game's puzzle creator as contest entries and so on. Locally, you can exchange created puzzles with other players, as well as send over a trial version of the game.<br/> <br/> Soothing music helps round out the package. There's a decent variety to the background audio, but whenever I'd get extremely serious about playing Picross 3D in long stretches, I eventually had to turn the volume down and play some music of my own. Maybe I just like to be on edge when I'm getting my logic on, I don't know.<br/> <br/> Picross 3D is one of those great examples of the \"easy to learn, difficult to master\" philosophy of puzzle-solving. You'll pick up the basics easily via the game's great tutorials, and solving the easy puzzles quickly becomes second nature. But once you have to start using the game's tools to cut away sections of the puzzle so you can mark and blast blocks on the inside, it starts to require more and more spatial awareness. In other words, Picross 3D gets hard. But it never feels impossible, and it's the sort of game that causes afternoons to simply vanish.

The game has a lot of new online features that feel like they were built to cater to the series' most fanatical supporters. Things like teams and the new online challenge system are things that will keep fans of the series engaged for months to come. At the same time, most of the game's career mode challenges are much easier when compared to the past games in the series. Things like playing games of S-K-A-T-E and forcing you to do extremely specific tricks are practically gone from the game, at least until you set out to start \"killing\" the game's challenges by performing more than the bare minimum. The whole game feels like a big funnel, designed to get players onto Xbox Live and the PlayStation Network, where they can mix it up in a ton of different ways. But that funnel has left the game's story and career feeling stripped and more insignificant than previous Skate career modes. The gameplay is as sharp as ever, but depending on what keeps you coming back to the series, you might not be as thrilled with the direction in which the series is headed.<br/><br/>Like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20661\" href=\"/skate-2/3030-20661/\" slug=\"skate-2\">Skate 2</a> before it, Skate 3 opens with a huge accident that leaves your skater horrifically mauled, justifying the game's create-a-skater while still essentially putting you in the shoes of the same skater from the previous game. This time around, you're trying to start your own skateboard company, and each goal you complete translates directly into board sales. There's still a flashy, well-produced live-action intro sequence, but once the company premise is established, there isn't really much of a story. The game gives you sales targets, you meet those targets by completing challenges, which opens up more challenges. Once you hit 1,000,000 board sales, the career is effectively complete, though you'll probably have plenty of goals left to try by that point. It took me around seven hours to sell a million boards. Along with setting up the company, you'll also form a skate team, ostensibly to further promote your line of skateboards. As you hit sales milestones, you'll customize more skaters for your team, and some of the goals have you skating as these guys for billboard photos and the ever-present team video.<br/><br/>The idea is solid, but there's little followthrough on the career mode's team concept. Most of the photo goals for your team are simply \"take a picture of your skater.\" It's up to you to decide what the photo looks like, so if you want a shot of your guy standing there, looking dumb, that's totally fine. The filming parts for your team video are similarly empty, with simple goals like \"perform any five tricks.\" The billboards show up around town, but the skate video you're supposedly shooting along the way never seems to surface. Also, even though you're building a new and huge skate company, you never really directly see anyone buying your boards. The sales number just increases every time you complete a task. It all feels like it would have benefitted from more of an actual story. Instead, playing the game alone feels more like a lengthy tutorial. You'll meet pro skaters along the way, but even these interactions feel a little flat, and the only justification for performing their tasks is to unlock additional shoes and other custom gear for your skate team to wear. But if your skate team is representing you, then why would you want to ride someone else's board, right?<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1271640-500x_feb_screen_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1271640\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1271640-500x_feb_screen_1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1271640\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1271640-500x_feb_screen_1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The controls will feel very familiar to fans of the series.</figcaption></figure>     Most of the game's challenges are broken up into two levels. The default completion state is to \"own\" a goal, and these tasks are awfully easy when compared to some of the tasks demanded of you in Skate 2. The deathraces, though more varied this time around, feel way easier. Playing S-K-A-T-E against the pros--by far the most frustrating part of the previous game--has been replaced with a more lenient game called 1UP, which trades turns back and forth as you try to outscore each other in a brief session, rather than being called upon to perform specific tricks. If you played Skate 2 and cheated your way through the S-K-A-T-E sessions there, you'll welcome the change. \"Own The Spot\" returns in the form of 16 various places in the city that you can trick off of, and you must reach a certain trick score to complete these. Photo and film goals are also present, but the filming side of the game has become more like the photo goals, rather than giving you a list of tasks that you can attempt to complete anywhere.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>All in all, \"owning\" the goals is way, way easier than it has been in the past. If you want to get trickier, you can attempt to \"kill\" most of the game's goals. The criteria for killing a goal gets way more specific than the owning instructions, and this is where you'll have to be able to pull off blunt slides and other specific tricks to proceed. Even these feel a bit easier. If you've been banging your head against the past two Skate games, you might find that the game is a bit too easy now, but it really feels well-tuned and designed to make sure that you're always making progress. The game never really restricts how you attack the goals, so you probably won't get hung up on one specific goal and have nowhere else to turn. Of course, if you're really stuck, you can always turn online.<br/><br/>The online side of Skate 3 is clearly where the developers spent the bulk of their time. The online play weaves in and out of the career mode, with most of the game's goals being offered in a cooperative online form, as well as their offline counterpart. So if you're really stuck on something, you can always call in a little help. This is most effective during the \"Own the Lot\" goals, which gives you a list of objectives to complete in and around one specific area. So if you can't pull off a 360 flip to save your life, get a posse together and handle it that way. Cooperating on photo goals also lets you take more creative photos, since you might have up to six players in the shot, if you time it right. All in all, the most interesting thing about the way the online is built is that it really feels like a game that rewards community effort, rather than just setting up a spot for experts to tear your punk-ass apart at every turn. Of course, that side is still in there, too.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1271650-500x_feb_screen_15_part3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1271650\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.562\" data-width=\"500\" style=\"width: 500px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1271650-500x_feb_screen_15_part3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1271650\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1271650-500x_feb_screen_15_part3.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1271650-500x_feb_screen_15_part3.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Port Carverton isn't as connected as San Vanelona was, but it still offers plenty of variety.</figcaption></figure>     Plenty of the career goals, as well as plenty of online-specific modes and tasks are available for competitive play. While you can hop in an unranked game by yourself and randomly battle it out with others, the ranked games are way more interesting. Ranked games are primarily built for your set skate teams, and these are built and managed like clans. There's a full system for creating a team, sending out invites, setting a custom logo, determining what sort of roles each player on the team has, and so on. So to play a team ranked game, you first join a team lobby, which matches you up with members of your crew, assuming they're online and looking to get matched up, as well. From there, your party moves into battle against another team, and the stats are tracked for all to see. Board sales are a factor here, too, as you'll sell more boards for wins, and board sales for your online team are tracked separately from your career total. While there's still a ranked solo option for players who aren't into joining things, playing on a team creates a real sense of accomplishment when you're taking out other teams, like you're making a name for your crew online.<br/><br/>For the most part, Skate 3 performs well and maintains a solid framerate. But it's also a much cleaner-looking game than its predecessors, at least by default. From the outset, Skate 2 defaulted to a low, realistic camera angle with a fisheye lens that made the entire game look like a filthy skate video. In Skate 3, that fisheye is off when you first fire it up. While you can turn it on, the framerate feels a lot less smooth, which I didn't find to be a trade-off worth making. The other instance of sketchy frames is in the game's new park editor. You can build terrific skate parks and share them online, but these areas don't run especially well, even when they're empty. Once you fill them up with custom parts, the issues become even more noticeable. Granted, these are pretty limited cases, and unless you get way into the community's created parks, you'll rarely notice any sluggishness.<br/><br/>Though the career mode itself isn't especially thrilling on its own, the online focus makes everything in Skate 3 feel like a bigger deal. If you're strictly a solo player, you'll probably find Skate 3 to be a sterile, temporary environment that doesn't feel as inviting as the previous game may have. But if you've even dabbled in the online world of Skate 2, you'll surely enjoy what Skate 3 has to offer. \u00a0", "deck": "Skate 3's offline portions feel flat and sterile, but its deeper online focus helps bring more meaning to every facet of the game.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-281/", "platforms": "Xbox 360, PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-28135/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/skate-3/3030-28135/", "id": 28135, "name": "Skate 3"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-05-11 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-89309/", "id": 89309, "name": "Skate 3"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/lost-planet-2-review/1900-282/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1343644-lp2_helix__8_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1343644\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"2560\" style=\"width: 2560px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1343644-lp2_helix__8_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1343644\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1343644-lp2_helix__8_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The action has gotten hotter on E.D.N. III.</figcaption></figure>     On paper, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25413\" href=\"/lost-planet-2/3030-25413/\" slug=\"lost-planet-2\">Lost Planet 2</a> looks like it ought to be a good (or great) online-oriented third-person shooter. It's got a lengthy campaign full of absolutely enormous monsters, and a lot more varied environments than the arctic-only levels of the first game. There's a full multiplayer component with a variety of maps and modes, and a whole array of giant powered robot armor (called <a data-ref-id=\"3055-673\" href=\"/vital-suit/3055-673/\" slug=\"vital-suit\">vital suits</a>) to pilot. And it's all tied together by a global character-progression system that lets you unlock a bunch of new weapons and abilities, not to mention some silly new cosmetic doohickeys, for your warrior. By the numbers, that seems to me like a recipe for an all-around entertaining (if not entirely original) action game.<br/> <br/> But the unfortunate reality is that every piece of Lost Planet 2 is poorly designed or clumsily bolted onto all the other parts, or both, resulting in an inconsistent, frustrating, and sometimes baffling experience whether you're playing the action or just trying to sift through the byzantine menus. You frequently get the sense that nobody at Capcom ever stepped back and really took a hard look at how all the game's systems fit together, to see if all the mechanics made sense and whether the action was fun to play or not. It's just a roughly made game from top to bottom.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17009/1245623-lp1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1245623\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/1/17009/1245623-lp1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1245623\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/1/17009/1245623-lp1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The outlandish akrid bosses are the most memorable thing about the campaign.</figcaption></figure>     Lost Planet 2 styles itself as such an online-centric experience that when you go to start a campaign game, you're actually creating a four-player online lobby. You can set your lobby to offline, but even then you're still advised to play with AI-controlled characters that actualy have fake usernames hovering over their heads to simulate the online co-op experience. The game practically requires real players to be any fun, though, since the AI teammates only pull their weight some of the time. Other times, they'll just hang around and not really pitch in while you do all the heavy lifting yourself. At times (mainly when fighting the bosses), the game is so punishing that the difficulty feels like it was balanced toward four real players capable of thinking tactically and not mindless automatons who run around aimlessly, so you'd be forgiven for playing the campaign on the easy setting if you're forced to play it alone. That's certainly the most pleasant way to play it by yourself.<br/> <br/> Despite the focus on cooperating with other human beings, Lost Planet 2 makes it maddeningly hard to actually get a co-op game going. You can't bring in players who haven't already reached the point in the campaign that you're trying to play, and likewise you can only join games that are running levels you've already seen yourself. Joining a game in progress doesn't drop you right into the action but merely leaves you staring at a static menu screen showing the players (both real and fake) who are currently playing. Presumably, you'd eventually get to join in the action at a checkpoint, but 15 minutes was the longest I could stand to look at that unmoving screen before quitting out, so I never got to test that particular feature. Other shooters have certainly gotten the chapter-selectable, drop-in style of campaign co-op right--<a data-ref-id=\"3030-26786\" href=\"/halo-reach/3030-26786/\" slug=\"halo-reach\">Halo</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-30615\" href=\"/gears-of-war-3/3030-30615/\" slug=\"gears-of-war-3\">Gears of War</a> come to mind--so it's hard to understand why this one makes it so tough to just get in and start shooting with friends.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1146556-958323_20090923_790screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146556\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56329113924051\" data-width=\"790\" style=\"width: 790px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1146556-958323_20090923_790screen004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1146556\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1146556-958323_20090923_790screen004.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33529/1146556-958323_20090923_790screen004.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The action is too slow and clunky to keep up with other modern shooters.</figcaption></figure>     Whether you're playing with friends or bots, the unbalanced difficulty is made a lot worse by the distance between checkpoints. If you run out of what passes for extra lives while fighting one of those bosses--and when's the last time you remember a shooter that had a finite number of lives?--you could find yourself losing 30 or 45 minutes of progress as you zoom way back to the last time the game meted out a checkpoint. As archaic as that is, it's not the worst of the game's messy campaign infrastructure. At one point in the back end of the campaign, I was playing an online-enabled game, on the off chance that someone might randomly jump into the action. My Internet connection dropped out for a second and disconnected me from Xbox Live, at which point the game abruptly cut to a black screen with a \"Disconnected from host\" error message. In a single-player game. That set me back at least 30 minutes of progress and incidentally made me never, ever want to play Lost Planet 2's campaign again.<br/> <br/> It doesn't help that the campaign isn't really much to write home about, anyway. It takes place some time after the first game, when the previously snow-covered planet <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1193\" href=\"/edn-iii/3035-1193/\" slug=\"edn-iii\">E.D.N. III</a> has undergone a rapid warming due to ongoing civil war, developing deserts, jungles, and vast oceans. With the focus squarely on co-op, the missions start to feel generic, almost like a primer for multiplayer, after a while. And since the story shifts from one warring faction to the next between every episode--with most characters wearing face masks and having no obvious names--it's hard to keep up with or really care about the events of the plot. The best part of the campaign is the sheer, ludicrous size of the \"category G\" <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1116\" href=\"/akrid/3015-1116/\" slug=\"akrid\">akrid</a> monsters, which should be familiar to veterans of the first game. You'll spend most of the campaign in this sequel shooting at human enemies, but every once in a while a boss monster will trot out that's so big it puts almost any other video game boss to shame. Too bad these guys aren't as fun to fight as they are impressive to see; you generally spend 10 to 20 minutes shooting them in glowing weak points, and soaking up a ton of damage from unavoidable attacks, until they finally die (or you do, and revert to the last checkpoint). Having been weaned on <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4350\" href=\"/contra/3030-4350/\" slug=\"contra\">Contra</a> in my youth, I'm no stranger to shooting things in glowing weak points until they die, but this is just excessive.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1369906-lp2_review02_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1369906\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1369906-lp2_review02_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1369906\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1369906-lp2_review02_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1369906-lp2_review02_bmp_jpgcopy.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Unlocking new gear is more complicated than it needs to be.</figcaption></figure>     The game's competitive multiplayer is a little more sensibly designed. It's got your standard run of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-451\" href=\"/deathmatch/3015-451/\" slug=\"deathmatch\">deathmatch</a> and territory-control modes, as well as variants on kill-the-VIP and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-25\" href=\"/capture-the-flag/3015-25/\" slug=\"capture-the-flag\">capture-the-flag</a> (or in this case, the akrid egg). The vital suits are available in the campaign but they play a bigger role here, since there are all manner of huge suits that can accommodate not just a pilot but several hangers-on who can fire from the sides. Heck, sometimes they aren't suits at all but more conventional vehicles like helicopters. There are a lot of ways to mix the vital suits and other gameplay-variable elements into the different modes that can change up the action. The typical ranked and custom multiplayer game types are available, as well as a faction match that lets you pick one of the five sides and compete over a lengthy period of time for global supremacy.<br/> <br/> It's too bad that the action in the multiplayer shares the same basic clunkiness of the campaign, though. The core controls just feel awkward, slow, and unresponsive compared to the better shooters on the market. You have to stop moving to change weapons. It takes what feels like forever to get up after getting knocked down. The sprint move feels slower than the regular movement speed. The grappling hook only works on a few surfaces, you can't use it in the air, and it takes way too long to get you on top of a ledge. The list goes on. The aiming and shooting are serviceable, but the movement isn't nearly as streamlined and accessible as it should be to make Lost Planet 2 feel as playable as other contemporary shooters. It's almost as if the game prioritizes long, flashy animations over basic playability. Both modes lean too heavily on meters and numbers, too. The thermal energy from the first game has been modified so that here you can use it to heal yourself and repair vital suits, but it still feels unnecessary. There's also a \"battle gauge\" that determines how many times you can respawn in the campaign (yes, you respawn, with a timer, even in single-player). The last thing I want to do in a heated firefight is micromanage multiple gauges and statistics that dictate my survivability, but there you have it.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1269361-lp2_x10_004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1269361\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/30036/1269361-lp2_x10_004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1269361\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1269361-lp2_x10_004.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/30036/1269361-lp2_x10_004.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Seriously, c'mon.</figcaption></figure>     The campaign and multiplayer modes are unified by a de rigueur character level-up system that parcels out new weapon types and plenty of for-looks-only armor and clothing options to customize your online fighter. But this system is perhaps the most baffling of all, since the game does a poor job of communicating information to you about virtually everything that's going on, from the amount of experience you gain through both the campaign and multiplayer matches to how your online characters from each faction level up and how or when you unlock new equipment. You mainly cash in experience points on an in-game slot machine to randomly unlock new weapons and abilities, but I repeatedly wasted my points receiving new online titles and emote animations more frequently than I got real new gear to use. Talk about frustrating. It's telling that I actually had to go to the game manual to clarify some of these obscure, unintuitive systems. Ask yourself how long it's been since you had to rely on a manual to enjoy a game like this.<br/> <br/> It feels like Capcom barely missed making a great game with Lost Planet 2. It looks fantastic; the multiplatform <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2059\" href=\"/mt-framework/3015-2059/\" slug=\"mt-framework\">MT Framework</a> engine that powered <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20569\" href=\"/resident-evil-5/3030-20569/\" slug=\"resident-evil-5\">Resident Evil 5</a>\u00a0last year is still pumping out truly great visuals, the enormous akrid bosses being the most prominent example.

At one point, and I swear I'm not making this up, you might stumble upon a cave inhabited by a guy whose only apparent purpose it is to tell you that \"it's a secret to everybody.\"\u00a0<br/> <br/> I cannot stress this point enough, as the Zelda connection is one of the primary defining characteristic for 3D Dot Game Heroes. Even after you read this review, you might play 3D Dot Game Heroes, and be shocked at just how directly it cribs from Zelda. Other than <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20991\" href=\"/darksiders/3030-20991/\" slug=\"darksiders\">Darksiders</a>--which, to be fair, keeps its inspiration sourcing limited to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12572\" href=\"/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time/3030-12572/\" slug=\"the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time\">Ocarina of Time</a>--you will be hard-pressed to find a game more directly informed by <a data-ref-id=\"3010-90\" href=\"/nintendo/3010-90/\" slug=\"nintendo\">Nintendo's</a> 8-bit adventure classic that wasn't developed by Nintendo itself.\u00a0<br/> <br/> And yet it's set apart by a certain self-awareness, as well as a visual style that takes the chunky 8-bit aesthetic and makes it three-dimensional, if just barely. It's hard not to be at least a little bit charmed by 3D Dot Game Heroes, though that charm has its limits. If you're not already fairly bananas about classic Zelda, or are at least nurturing an abiding affection for the square-wave sounds and butchered grammar that now typifies Japanese console games from the 1980s, 3D Dot Game Heroes might be a harder sell. It's not that this is a subpar Zelda-style adventure, and I think 3D Dot Game Heroes does a decent job of justifying its $40 price tag with a length that's reasonable by modern standards, it's just that the differences are more flash and gimmick than anything truly meaningful.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1261902-3ddotgameheroes_screens_39__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1261902\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.56122448979592\" data-width=\"588\" style=\"width: 588px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1261902-3ddotgameheroes_screens_39__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1261902\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1261902-3ddotgameheroes_screens_39__screenshot_viewer_medium.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Dotnia, before polygons got all trendy.</figcaption></figure>     One key differentiator between 3D Dot Game Heroes and its inspirator is the fact that, to put it rather plainly, you're not playing it as Link. Instead of rolling as some knock-off green-clad elf lad, the look of your character is up to you. You can choose from a pretty deep stock library of character models, which include fantasy tropes like scruffy young adventurers, gallant knights, and dark mages, as well as more non-sequiturial stuff like a shark's fin made to look like it's poking up out of the ground, plus a number of characters from past, unrelated From Software games. If you're really dead set on rocking pointy ears and a green tunic, there's a simple polygonal editor that lets you design your character from the ground up. I personally lack the patience to make anything worthwhile with the editor, though I thought my swirling nightmare of random shapes carried its own charm.<br/> <br/> That 3D Dot Game Heroes gives you the choice to swap out your character model whenever you load up the game speaks to just how little stock the game puts in its narrative, other than as a vehicle for some extremely mild satire. You'll see references dropped to other classic NES games like the original <a data-ref-id=\"3025-5\" href=\"/metal-gear/3025-5/\" slug=\"metal-gear\">Metal Gear</a>, and the citizens of Dotnia, 3D Dot Game Heroes' <a data-ref-id=\"3035-13\" href=\"/hyrule/3035-13/\" slug=\"hyrule\">Hyrule</a> stand-in, are perfectly aware of the fact that, years ago, their land used to be two-dimensional.<br/> <br/> The familiarity of the Zelda-inspired gameplay in 3D Dot Game Heroes is offset by a very peculiar 3D visual style. Everything in the world appears to be constructed out of big fat blocks, mimicking the low-res quality of 8-bit visuals, which are married with modern elements like lighting, physics, particle effects, and an extremely pronounced depth-of-field effect. It's an interesting blend of old and new that makes these piles of blocks look and feel somehow more real. Similarly, the soundtrack weaves between blippy synthesized sounds and a full, orchestral-sounding score.<br/> <br/> If you look past the tricky visuals, something that's admittedly pretty hard to do, you'll see a game that's operating on a lot of borrowed charm. There are differences, such as the fact that, when you're at maximum health, rather than shooting out an energy projectile with your sword, your sword becomes comically huge in a way that would put <a data-ref-id=\"3005-321\" href=\"/cloud-strife/3005-321/\" slug=\"cloud-strife\">Cloud Strife</a> to shame.

Now blow everything up!</figcaption></figure>     That <a data-ref-id=\"3030-25523\" href=\"/splitsecond/3030-25523/\" slug=\"splitsecond\">Split/Second</a> is a racing game is almost beside the point. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6353\" href=\"/black-rock-studio/3010-6353/\" slug=\"black-rock-studio\">Black Rock Studio</a>--which previously developed the gorgeous ATV racer <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20957\" href=\"/pure/3030-20957/\" slug=\"pure\">Pure</a>, as well as games in the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-542\" href=\"/motogp/3025-542/\" slug=\"motogp\">MotoGP</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-41\" href=\"/atv-offroad-fury/3025-41/\" slug=\"atv-offroad-fury\">ATV Offroad Fury</a> franchises when it was still part of the <a data-ref-id=\"3010-2267\" href=\"/climax-group-the/3010-2267/\" slug=\"climax-group-the\">Climax Group</a>--understands the visceral satisfaction of a good racing game, and that understanding is apparent in Split/Second's constantly careening handling. But, like the <a data-ref-id=\"3040-74887\" href=\"/jerry-bruckheimer/3040-74887/\" slug=\"jerry-bruckheimer\">Bruckheimer</a> films it mines much of its stylistic inspiration from,\u00a0it's clear from the word <i>go</i> that Split/Second is more about derailing the race with obsessively orchestrated explosions while looking <i>absolutely fantastic</i> than it is about the actual racing. Don't take this as a negative; it's simply <i>true</i>, and it makes for an almost euphoric experience, at least for the first few hours. Like any good sugar rush, Split/Second peaks early, and it peaks fantastically, but there are (much to my personal surprise) diminishing returns on the explosions, and the increasingly flagrant computer competitors can curdle the chaos that started off oh-so-sweet.<br/> <br/> But I'm getting ahead of myself here, as there's nothing terribly self-explanatory about the incredible contrivances that make Split/Second unique, and occasionally great. Speaking broadly, I've taken to describing it as <a data-ref-id=\"3025-76\" href=\"/burnout/3025-76/\" slug=\"burnout\">Burnout</a> in reverse--rather than throwing cars at the environments to see what happens, you get your warm-and-fuzzies in Split/Second by throwing the environment at the cars. This Burnout comparison holds up, I think, beyond the concept stage, as Split/Second has a similar zest for destruction, and it too rewards the player for <a data-ref-id=\"3015-74\" href=\"/drifting/3015-74/\" slug=\"drifting\">drifting</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1126\" href=\"/drafting/3015-1126/\" slug=\"drafting\">drafting</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-379\" href=\"/jump/3015-379/\" slug=\"jump\">jumping</a>. What you get in Split/Second for your driving derring-do, though, is energy towards a three-part power-play meter. Power plays, in the simplest terms, are explosive environmental triggers you can use to derail, or simply destroy, competing racers--and if you're not careful, yourself--and they are the absolute crux of Split/Second.\u00a0<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1377648-powerplant_night_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1377648\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1377648-powerplant_night_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1377648\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1377648-powerplant_night_01.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0\"Power play\" is just another word for \"fun button.\"</figcaption></figure>     If you've got enough juice in the power-play meter, and the timing is right, you'll see a little icon pop up above the vehicle of an opponent that's in front of you, and with the press of a button, something awful will happen. Each track is littered with power play opportunities both big and small. Some of them you'll see repeated throughout the game, such as buses, semi trucks, and clusters of taxi cabs that will explode out into the middle of the track, or hovering helicopters that will drop explosive barrels on command. The best power plays, though, are unique to the location, and often involve some large structure falling violently onto the track.\u00a0<br/> <br/> You can also tap into your power-play meter to open up <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3171\" href=\"/shortcut/3015-3171/\" slug=\"shortcut\">shortcuts</a>.\u00a0Bigger power plays will drain all three sections of your meter, as will the dramatic mid-race course changes, which are really Split/Second's <i>pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance</i>. Skyscrapers will tip, cruise ships will run aground, and massive dams will crumble with a profound immediacy as you hurtle down the course doing a simulated buck-twenty. Couching these incredible disasters in a racing game is the purest genius of Split/Second, because there's ultimately no avoiding the chaos that's unfurling in front of you--the best you can hope is to dodge the worst parts of it. There's actually a replay option that will occasionally pop up after you've done something truly atrocious, but watching these disasters from a static perspective is comparatively kind of boring.<br/> <br/> Split/Second brokers heavily in lookalike landmarks for its mocked-up city, and it seems pretty deliberate that you might be reminded of the Brooklyn Bridge, the Space Needle, or the Hoover Dam while playing the game. There's certainly an extra charge to be had from seeing recognizable structures come tumbling down, but the game is also clear about making the whole thing \"safe,\" at least from a weird, twice-removed psychological standpoint. You see, this isn't a real city. I mean, yeah, it's a video game, so you already inherently know it's not a \"real\" city. But even within the reality of the game, it's actually just a giant, elaborate soundstage built specifically for an impossibly big-budget reality TV competition called <i>Split/Second</i>, which is kicking off its next season.\u00a0<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1377649-downtown_expressway_train_derailment_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1377649\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1377649-downtown_expressway_train_derailment_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1377649\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1377649-downtown_expressway_train_derailment_03.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1377649-downtown_expressway_train_derailment_03.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0It looks even better in motion. No, really.</figcaption></figure>     While the temptation to go all <i>Running Man</i> with the reality competition concept would seem overwhelming--with the evil network execs and the wrongfully imprisoned contestant and the hypocritical hand-wringing about entertainment gone too far--the game uses a surprisingly light touch. The reality show idea mostly serves to justify the power plays, and to provide some structure for the single-player experience, which splits the game up into twelve episodes, each consisting of five races. That's not to say it doesn't commit to the idea, with really keen touches like teaser promos for the next episode that run while the credits for the episode you just finished roll at the bottom of the screen.\u00a0The quality of the packaging in Split/Second isn't limited to the bumpers, though, as this is from top to bottom a really amazing-looking racing game.\u00a0\u00a0The sensation of speed is bracing, all of the explosive environmental effects look top-notch, and the whole game is swathed in\u00a0<i>verit\u00e9</i>\u00a0touches like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-248\" href=\"/motion-blur/3015-248/\" slug=\"motion-blur\">motion blur</a>, camera shake, light bleed, and some heavy vignetting around the edges of the screen that really amp up the sense of reality.\u00a0Even if it's not supposed to be a real place within the context of the game, it's so dense with gritty, vulcanized detail that it's convincing enough.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1377644-airstrike_graveyard_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1377644\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1377644-airstrike_graveyard_04.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1377644\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1377644-airstrike_graveyard_04.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1377644-airstrike_graveyard_04.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0This only reaffirms my hatred of helicopters.</figcaption></figure>     There's a lot of straight racing in the single-player season--at least what passes for \"straight\" in Split/Second--though there are elimination events as well, where the last player in the pack is eliminated at regular intervals, until just one racer remains. There are survival races where rolling semi trucks throw explosive barrels out the back, and you're scored on how many of these trucks you can pass without getting blowed up. The weirdest, and least successful of the single-player events involves you dodging incoming missile attacks from a marauding helicopter. Million-dollar-super-car-versus-military-attack-helicopter is an idea tailor-made for Split/Second, and even on paper it sounds like 27 kinds of awesome, but the scoring is complicated and seems arbitrary, and it goes against the staunchly pro-speed, pro-destruction campaign that the rest of the game rides on.<br/> <br/> So some of the events are duds, but the two things that really temper my appreciation for Split/Second are repetition, cheatin'-ass AI opponents, and repetition. Repetition is kind of an inherent issue for racing games in general, since your performance often hinges on knowing, or at least being able to anticipate, what's coming next. But Split/Second is all about the shock of first impressions, and repetition is death for surprises. The first time you see a big location-specific power play go off, you're too gobsmacked by what you're seeing to really react. The second time, you have some idea of what's coming and can prepare yourself accordingly. By the third time you're not even looking at what's blowing up, since, if you're doing the same race three times in a row, you're probably preoccupied with struggling against the aforementioned cheatin'-ass AI opponents.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1377647-downtown_expressway_hud_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1377647\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1377647-downtown_expressway_hud_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1377647\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1377647-downtown_expressway_hud_01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1377647-downtown_expressway_hud_01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Chances are, you won't stay in first very long.</figcaption></figure>     For me, the single-player game actually maintained the illusion that it was putting up a fair fight until I reached about the halfway point. Maybe I was too distracted by all the bedlam, but that's about when I noticed that opponents whose vehicles I had thoroughly outclassed were consistently whizzing past me at the final turn in huge packs, turning my first-place medal win into a worthless fifth-place position. That was also about the point that I realized that, with no recourse against the racers behind you, being in first place in Split/Second is kind of dull, and occasionally frustrating.\u00a0<br/> <br/> This confluence led me to a weird, contrived gameplay style where I would try and outsmart the simple rubberband AI by deliberately hanging out in the middle of the pack for most of the race, only to really break out in the back half of the final lap. The constant chaos already makes it seem like you're barely in control of your fate; the obviously rigged competition makes your impact on the outcome at least <i>feel</i> diminished. Hell, maybe they should've gone for an evil executive subplot after all. The eight-player online multiplayer, as you might imagine, is unfettered by such AI issues, though it's still somewhat affected by the increased familiarity brought on by repetition.\u00a0<br/><br/> One of the toughest parts of reviewing a video game is assessing how much value to place on, well, value. If you were going by the pure math of hours-to-dollars, Split/Second might not seem great, and in the long-term, there's not a huge amount of replayability here. Yet I can't help but place a high value on my first few hours with Split/Second, which were action-packed with more jaw-dropping thrills than any other recent game I care to recall.

The Forgotten Sands itself is a breezy, by-the-numbers <a data-ref-id=\"3025-431\" href=\"/prince-of-persia/3025-431/\" slug=\"prince-of-persia\">Prince of Persia</a> game that makes some minor improvements to the series' formula. Its rough, middling production values won't blow you away, but if you've been longing for more of the complex gymnastic puzzles and precision timing the series has been known for since 2003, this is a fun enough action game to spend a few evenings with.<br/> <br/>   Everything about The Forgotten Sands sort of screams \"side story\" at you. It takes place sometime between The Sands of Time and Warrior Within, when the still-nameless <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2623\" href=\"/the-prince/3005-2623/\" slug=\"the-prince\">prince</a> embarks on his travels as a young man and finds his brother Malik's castle under siege by a warring kingdom. After his troops fail to repel the assault, Malik rashly opens a magical seal imprisoning the legendary army of King Solomon that just happened to be hanging out in his palace basement, falsely believing the army once fought <i>for</i> Solomon in a time long past and would return to Malik's aid in the present day. Yeah, good luck with that.<br/> <br/>       To the great misfortune of Malik and his kingdom (but the surprise of no one), it turns out that army was created to <i>destroy</i> Solomon. Once free, the horde is clearly none too happy about its millennium of captivity and sweeps across the castle turning everyone (save Malik and the prince, conveniently) into sand. It is, of course, up to the two brothers to fight back this ancient curse and find some way to stuff it back into its prison before the credits roll. This premise acceptably justifies the game's sparse cast--it's just the prince, Malik, an otherworldly magical lady who shows up to grant you new powers occasionally, and a fire demon running around wreaking havoc--but there's only a thin wisp of a storyline here, and unfortunately this game misses a ripe chance to set up the events of the game that follows it chronologically. Instead, it just sort of... ends, without much fanfare.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1245237-14340_960x540crop0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1245237\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"960\" style=\"width: 960px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1246/1245237-14340_960x540crop0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1245237\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1246/1245237-14340_960x540crop0.jpg\"></a><figcaption>  \u00a0Group combat, check.</figcaption></figure>   What follows from this brief intro is around 10 hours of the series' trademark acrobatic obstacles punctuated by staccato moments of large-scale melee combat. If you played any of those POP games on last-generation consoles, you're already well acquainted with this formula; Forgotten Sands adheres to it so strictly that you still get that broad camera pan across each new environment showing you exactly what combination of pillars, poles, ledges and sheer walls you're expected to nimbly navigate to get to the next section of the castle. Unlike the blithely forgiving '08 Prince of Persia, you can actually die in this game if you miss a jump or land on a spinning razor blade, and some of the combinations of jumps, swings, and magical powers you have to combine with split-second precision. To those who complained that the last game was too easy, this is the more demanding POP game you were looking for.<br/> <br/>       Nothing about the basics of the jumping, climbing, and wall-running feels new in Forgotten Sands, but the developers did layer in some interesting new mechanics to enliven all the familiar platforming. You can solidify flowing water, which usually comes in the form of spouts that become makeshift poles you can swing on, and waterfalls that turn into walls you can run up or across. Another power lets you temporarily restore broken ledges and walls, long enough to use them to springboard up to greater heights. And an air dash lets you essentially teleport straight to a nearby enemy to simultaneously kill them and cover a big distance instantly.\u00a0<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1275852-poptm_screenshots_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275852\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1275852-poptm_screenshots_20.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275852\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1275852-poptm_screenshots_20.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1275852-poptm_screenshots_20.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>  \u00a0New platforming powers, check.</figcaption></figure>   These powers are really responsive--you can turn them on and off instantly at the touch of a button, and the level designers do a great job of making you use them all rapidly midair to really test your platforming skills as the game goes on. Later on, it's not uncommon to use the water power, then the restoration one, then the dash all in the course of one jump. Other times you'll have to flip the water power on and off repeatedly to cross a series of waterfalls or alternating fountains. I found these more demanding moments satisfying and exciting enough to keep the rote platforming pretty fresh throughout the game.

The game likes to attack you with anywhere between five and 50 sand monsters at a time, and the combat is a little more precise and satisfying than its slightly button-mashy feel first suggests. In fact, there are a lot of ways to manage the sizable groups of enemies you run into. You can roll away from enemies, kick them to knock them down or disarm their shields, crowd-surf from the head of one enemy to the next, and charge up stronger slashes to mix in with your basic sword combo. You can also unlock some elemental combat powers from a skill tree as you gain experience, though aside from a whirlwind power that knocks down everyone around you, I didn't find these very useful and preferred to just dodge and slash my way through the hordes. And the swordplay is the sort that lets you broadly hit several enemies at once, so this isn't the kind of bone-crunching precision of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23245\" href=\"/batman-arkham-asylum/3030-23245/\" slug=\"batman-arkham-asylum\">Batman: Arkham Asylum's</a> incredible melee combat. I'm still waiting for someone to do third-person hand-to-hand action half as well as that game did.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1275844-c4_pop_screenshots_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275844\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1275844-c4_pop_screenshots_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1275844\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1275844-c4_pop_screenshots_02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1275844-c4_pop_screenshots_02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>  \u00a0THIS... IS... PERSIA.</figcaption></figure>       Despite the finely tuned level design and decent variety in the action, Forgotten Sands just feels a little rough around the edges. It's not a very good-looking game by current standards; most of it looks flat, with a very low level of detail in the castle environments. Even the different sections of the palace all look more or less the same, just with different color palettes. \u00a0And I disliked the weird design of the prince himself so much that I played most of the game with him wearing an <a data-ref-id=\"3005-10269\" href=\"/ezio-auditore-da-firenze/3005-10269/\" slug=\"ezio-auditore-da-firenze\">Ezio</a> costume, as soon as I unlocked it. In addition, there are too many little nagging issues to list out here, issues with the way the prince will sometimes fail to grasp a ledge or make a proper jump, problems with unwieldy camera angles in tight spaces, and cutscenes that end abruptly or feature rough animations that feel like they weren't entirely finished in some cases. None of these issues are game-breaking on their own, but cumulatively they add up to make the game feel less polished and impressive than it should be.<br/> <br/>   The Forgotten Sands is the very definition of a pretty good Prince of Persia game that doesn't feel like it entirely lives up to the series' vaunted pedigree. Times are changing, of course, and you could argue that <a data-ref-id=\"3025-38\" href=\"/assassins-creed/3025-38/\" slug=\"assassins-creed\">Assassin's Creed</a> has justifiably superseded Prince of Persia in Ubisoft's stable of action games. It's clear which franchise is receiving the lion's share of development efforts these days, anyway. But the prince has still got plenty of fight left in him, and next time out, whatever timeline or set of characters they end up going with, I hope Ubisoft gives him the attention he deserves. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "This is no more and no less than a pretty good reprisal of last generation's Prince of Persia games.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-285/", "platforms": "Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29321/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/prince-of-persia-the-forgotten-sands/3030-29321/", "id": 29321, "name": "Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-05-18 15:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-89083/", "id": 89083, "name": "Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/super-mario-galaxy-2-review/1900-286/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/83448/1379450-power_star__super_mario_galaxy_2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1379450\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5615763546798\" data-width=\"812\" style=\"width: 812px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/83448/1379450-power_star__super_mario_galaxy_2_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1379450\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/83448/1379450-power_star__super_mario_galaxy_2_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0I imagine this is the photo Mario gets taken at Sears.</figcaption></figure>     If you look at the history of the core Mario games, it's actually rare to see as direct a sequel as\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3030-26839\" href=\"/super-mario-galaxy-2/3030-26839/\" slug=\"super-mario-galaxy-2\">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a>, particularly over the past decade. While the game's development history--which saw it start its life as Super Mario Galaxy 1.5--might paint it as an also-ran, the finished product is about as polished and propulsive as any <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a> adventure before it. A number of appreciable new gameplay concepts have been introduced here, including that infernal dinosaur <a data-ref-id=\"3005-700\" href=\"/yoshi/3005-700/\" slug=\"yoshi\">Yoshi</a> and a whole new wardrobe of clever suits, and the levels are even more ambitious with the crazy ways in which they play with the relative laws of gravity. So it doesn't have quite the same New Mario smell as the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16094\" href=\"/super-mario-galaxy/3030-16094/\" slug=\"super-mario-galaxy\">original Galaxy</a>, but there are far worse games to draw favorable comparisons to. Maybe it's been just long enough since the first one came out for my memory to fade, but I still found the style of action as fun and fresh as I did two and a half years ago.<br/> <br/> If there's any consistency between most Mario games, it's the jumping-off point, and Galaxy 2 stays true to the rich tradition of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-337\" href=\"/bowser/3005-337/\" slug=\"bowser\">Bowser</a> kidnapping <a data-ref-id=\"3005-709\" href=\"/princess-peach/3005-709/\" slug=\"princess-peach\">Princess Peach</a> and Mario giving chase. This time Mister Mustache teams up with a ragtag crew of <a data-ref-id=\"3015-675\" href=\"/luma/3015-675/\" slug=\"luma\">lumas</a>, those weird little raw-chicken-shaped star people from the first Galaxy, on a planetoid spaceship that looks like a topiary version of Mario's head. Cruising across the universe in this spaceship--or should I say, faceship--Mario follows a mostly linear, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-10299\" href=\"/super-mario-bros-3/3030-10299/\" slug=\"super-mario-bros-3\">Super-Mario-Bros.-3</a>-style map system from one level to the next. Though there are still <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1583\" href=\"/star-bits/3015-1583/\" slug=\"star-bits\">star bits</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-219\" href=\"/coin/3055-219/\" slug=\"coin\">coins</a>, and a few other trinkets to collect and cash in for various power-ups and unlockables, your main concern is collecting stars, which is what throttles your progression from one level to the next. In a structure that can be traced all the way back to <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2931\" href=\"/super-mario-64/3030-2931/\" slug=\"super-mario-64\">Super Mario 64</a>, most levels also feature secret stars and secondary stars for you to go back and collect.<br/> <br/> Traditionally, a lot of those bonus stars are optional, but the star requirements in Galaxy 2 are pretty high, and other than the deliberately crazy-hard and brutal bonus world you unlock after you finish the game, I didn't fee like I had left very many stars on the table by the time the credits rolled. I don't think Galaxy 2 is actually that much more difficult than the first, it's just that a lot of the harder stuff ends up being part of the critical path. I definitely engaged in my fair share of one-sided yelling matches with my TV playing the game, but it almost always seemed fair, and there was only one occasion I can recall where I felt like it was the game's fault and not my own. It's tough, but it provides you with more than enough tools to get the job done.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355196\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5615763546798\" data-width=\"812\" style=\"width: 812px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355196\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1355196-smg04_1_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Suit up!</figcaption></figure>     Personally, as a big-time Super Mario Bros. 3 fan, I love seeing Mario in crazy-ass suits, and this game represents the single largest influx of new suits since then. The <a data-ref-id=\"3055-10\" href=\"/fire-flower/3055-10/\" slug=\"fire-flower\">fire suit</a>, the bee suit, and the spring suit all return, and the game also introduces a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-3654\" href=\"/cloud-suit/3055-3654/\" slug=\"cloud-suit\">cloud suit</a> that lets Mario conjure up a series of floating platforms; a rock suit that lets him turn into a rolling boulder to smash through enemies and obstacles; and a boo suit that turns him into an officious-looking, mustachioed ghost that can float around and pass right through certain obstacles. The powers they imbue you with are unique, and the game consistently explores their impact on the gameplay in interesting ways.<br/><br/> Galaxy 2 also marks the return of Yoshi. Now, I'm historically not so fond of that cutesy, inexplicably boot-wearing dinosaur, but his abilities make him a smart addition here. Yoshi can gobble up enemies, turning specific types--like those nihilistic <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1581\" href=\"/bullet-bill/3015-1581/\" slug=\"bullet-bill\">Bullet Bills</a>--into deadly projectiles. You'll find special swing points that only Yoshi can use, as well as highly reactive fruit that can turn Yoshi into a leaky balloon, a land-rocket, or a walking lantern. For as many new tricks as Galaxy 2 introduces, I never felt overwhelmed by the options, and the game does some smart handholding, providing entirely optional tutorials whenever a significant new gameplay concept is introduced. It's a touch that helps keep the game accessible\u00a0to those not already familiar with the odd nuances of the original Galaxy.\u00a0At the same time, the vast array of abilities you have at your disposal helps keep things feeling fresh throughout. This isn't a short game, and it took me a good thirteen hours to make my way to my final encounter with Bowser, but it was never overly reliant on one specific ability, and I always felt like I was seeing something new.<br/><br/> Much of that credit, though, has to go to the level design, which seem much bolder than before, and more willing to take some weird risks with the planetoids and abstract platforming that set the tone in the original Galaxy. The relative virtues of gravity are far more contentious, levels will fold in on themselves in a way that's reminiscent of what you might get if MC Escher did origami, and there are entire levels that hinge on the rhythmic fluctuations of physical law. Yet these heady concepts are executed so deftly that I never found myself confused or uncertain about that behavior. The only real downside is that some of the gravity play might be too intense for certain players, and if games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21170\" href=\"/portal/3030-21170/\" slug=\"portal\">Portal</a> trigger your sense of vertigo, you may have some problems staying right-side-up here.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355204-smg11_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355204\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5615763546798\" data-width=\"812\" style=\"width: 812px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.2%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1355204-smg11_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1355204\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1355204-smg11_1_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1355204-smg11_1_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0There are plenty of big, crazy boss fights, too.</figcaption></figure>     The Mario name represents one of the most potent payloads of nostalgia in video games, something that Galaxy 2 certainly taps into, but it does so with a fairly surprising amount of restraint, and in ways that ultimately benefit the finished product. In full throwback fashion, the game will fluidly switch between full 3D movement and pseudo-side-scrolling action as the levels demand it. There are <a data-ref-id=\"3005-943\" href=\"/boo/3005-943/\" slug=\"boo\">Boo</a> houses, there is a <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2793\" href=\"/giant-environment/3015-2793/\" slug=\"giant-environment\">giant world</a>, and there are full-level homages to Super Mario 64 and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-6649\" href=\"/super-mario-sunshine/3030-6649/\" slug=\"super-mario-sunshine\">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, the latter of which is (arguably) better than anything that was actually <i>in</i> Super Mario Sunshine.\u00a0<br/><br/> Of course there's the music, which trades both in remixed classics and some jaunty new tunes. And unlike the first Galaxy, you don't have to collect every last star in order to play as <a data-ref-id=\"3005-370\" href=\"/luigi/3005-370/\" slug=\"luigi\">Luigi</a>, who will pop up in random levels and offer to take over for Mario for a little bit. I didn't feel like he changed the action much, but it's fun to see the lesser Mario brother getting some play. If there's one Mario trope that gets revisited here that I could've done without, it's the repeating Bowser encounters, simply because they end up diminishing the game's final encounter. After some of the challenges I had to fight through to get to that point, it felt just a little underwhelming.<br/><br/> For all the meaningful changes and additions that have been made, this is still <i>more</i> Super Mario Galaxy--which is to say that it looks and sounds about as good as a game for the Wii ever has, with consistently inventive level design, and exceptionally responsive gameplay.

The crossover racing game pedigree established by Project Gotham Racing--and, to a similar degree, the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-3027\" href=\"/metropolis-street-racer/3030-3027/\" slug=\"metropolis-street-racer\">Metropolis Street Racer</a>\u00a0series that came before it--is apparent in the real-world-plus environments and the weight with which the bevy of licensed cars handle in Blur. It's also hard to ignore the black-lit neon glow that both Blur and Geometry Wars share, but there's a third game that's owed its due here, and that's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-507\" href=\"/mario-kart/3025-507/\" slug=\"mario-kart\">Mario Kart</a>. Blur calls it \"powered up racing,\" but it's basically putting a more sophisticated face on a genre of racing game that has seen peaks in popularity, but has never really broken out of its casual, kid-friendly ghetto. The parts are familiar, but the pairing makes for a unique, if not necessarily transcendental, kind of chaotic fun.<br/><br/> If you've played one of Bizarre Creations' past racing games, you'll be coming into Blur with a pretty good idea of how the cars will handle. BC has rarely aimed for 100% simulation-style authenticity with its racing games, but Blur steers well clear of any arcade-style comparisons simply by demanding that you not barrel full-throttle into ever turn, expecting to effortlessly drift your way through. You'll (hopefully) learn early that such behavior will almost invariably end in a disappointing spin-out, and that each car has a fairly specific handling profile. There are multiple classes of cars, but it's not always a clear-cut case of better-than/worse-than, with some flourishing on the game's slippery dirt tracks, while others are better equipped for the narrow urban corridors and hard turns of the street courses. There's just a huge number of cars in Blur, and they cover a wide range of makes, models, and vintages, from high-whining European super-cars to knobby-tired 4x4 off-roaders. Cars will occasionally bump awkwardly up into the air upon impact, and there can be some squirreliness when you don't expect it, but there's a general sense of sturdiness to the core driving in Blur.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63540/1357589-screen_000073.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1357589\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63540/1357589-screen_000073.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1357589\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63540/1357589-screen_000073.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The power-ups sound as sci-fi as they look.</figcaption></figure>     It's a sense that is then completely up-ended by the game's power-up system, which litters the tracks with icons that you can pick up and store up to three of. It's a good thing, too, because otherwise Blur would be a competent racer, but one that's not nearly as noteworthy or as visually striking. The incandescent power-ups, and the light-writer aesthetic that they lend to the rest of the game, are absolutely key to the experience here. The game trades in its own unique power-up patois, which, despite some exotic names, tend to do the kinds of things you expect from combative racing games. You've got common <a data-ref-id=\"3055-644\" href=\"/energy-force-shield/3055-644/\" slug=\"energy-force-shield\">shield</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-503\" href=\"/nitrous/3055-503/\" slug=\"nitrous\">nitrous</a>, and <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1412\" href=\"/anti-personnel-mine/3055-1412/\" slug=\"anti-personnel-mine\">mine</a>-dropping abilities, as well as the barge, which sends out a localized shockwave; the bolt, which arms you with three, small, long-range-capable projectiles; the shock, which lays a gauntlet of lightning columns out in front of the first-place racer; and the shunt, the heavy-hitter of the lot, which allows you to lock onto a nearby opponent and send them flipping into the air.\u00a0<br/><br/> Most of the offensive weapons will at least slow you down and do some damage that, if allowed to go unchecked, will leave you a smoldering wreck, at least for a few precious seconds while you wait for a new car to spawn. But what makes the power-up system in Blur so strategically interesting is the way you can counter most offensive attacks with other offensives or alternate fires. If someone locks onto you with a shunt, you can fire a shunt or a series of bolts back, drop a mine, or trigger a barge to neutralize it. It's a system that requires good situational awareness, smart power-up management, and a firm understanding of the rock-paper-scissors-lizard-<a data-ref-id=\"3005-6842\" href=\"/spock/3005-6842/\" slug=\"spock\">Spock</a> dynamics of the power-ups, and it's responsible for much of Blur's chaotic charm. Exacerbating that chaos is the fact that Blur tends to trade in high-volume races, often putting twenty cars on the track at once. This can make the first lap particularly volatile, but the power-ups ensure that you're bound to experience hard swings in any lap.<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63540/1357588-screen_000064.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1357588\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/63540/1357588-screen_000064.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1357588\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63540/1357588-screen_000064.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/6/63540/1357588-screen_000064.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Racing like a jerk is always more fun with friends!</figcaption></figure>     Save for the simulation-style games that put more emphasis on time trials than live opponents, most racing games tend to benefit from live competition, and this is especially so for kart racers. So I wasn't too surprised to find that the single-player portion of Blur wasn't really the main draw of this package, though I was still a little surprised at how simple and, due to some balancing issues, fairly inessential it ended up being. The progression is simple and linear, presenting you with a series of brackets, each anchored by a unique named driver. Complete enough races and meet all of that driver's conditions, and you'll unlock the next bracket. You'll unlock new cars along the way, as well the bracket leaders' custom ride along with a unique power-up enhancement with each bracket win. The problem with the career, aside from its relative simplicity, is that it's freakin' hard, with the computer-controlled drivers giving no quarter almost from the get-go. In the spirit of full disclosure, I should say that I didn't make it through the whole single-player campaign, partially because I found myself frustrated with repeating the same races over and over again, and partially because I felt like, after the first few brackets, I wasn't really seeing anything new, just stiffer competition.\u00a0<br/><br/> But really, what pulled me away from the career was the draw of Blur's online multiplayer, which adopts the increasingly familiar carrot-on-a-stick persistence popularized by Modern Warfare, rewarding you with access to new cars, performance-enhancing mods, and different online playlists for your performance. The beauty of this, and what sets it so far apart from the single-player game, is that you don't need to win every race to earn experience towards your rank--heck, you don't even have to place, so long as you drive with a little panache and make smart, or at least frequent use of the power-up system. There are a hundred little ways that you can earn points towards your rank, and I found regular satisfaction finishing in the middle of the pack, but still cashing in plenty of points from some performance-based challenge. It took me a good six hours of time logged in the multiplayer to climb about halfway up the online ranking system, though I get the sense that your progression grows exponentially slower with each additional level.<br/><br/>\u00a0 I suppose it's also worth mentioning that Blur is the most socially networked game I've personally seen, with hooks for both <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3476\" href=\"/facebook-connectivity/3015-3476/\" slug=\"facebook-connectivity\">Facebook</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-3827\" href=\"/twitter-support/3015-3827/\" slug=\"twitter-support\">Twitter</a>, allowing you to bug the everliving hell out of your friends and followers with weird automated messages. It's kind of dumb, and it's all completely optional, though it seems like a portent of bad things to come in other, future games. What makes the social underpinnings of Blur meaningful, though, is the way it lets you tag a buddy as your arch rival, adding the objective of beating their performance in specific races.<br/> <br/> If you step back and look at the parts, there's a weird dissonance to Blur, and it doesn't seem like it should work as well as it does, even if it can be an imperfect experience.

Some of its systems, like the clinch position, weren't as straightforward as they could have been. The game didn't put its best foot forward when it came to teaching you about the various moves and maneuvers that make up a mixed-martial arts battle, either. It then surrounded this solid fighting system with a typical menagerie of modes. This year's game makes important strides in the fighting itself, enhancing or completely redesigning some of the systems you'll employ during a fight. It's also much better about teaching you how and when to use each of the tools at your disposal. But the offline modes in this year's game are still a little underwhelming, making it best suited for competitive players that just want to get online and <i>fight</i>.<br/> <br/> The fighting system has been enhanced in ways that make it easier to understand in some cases, and deeper in others. For example, the standing clinch, where the two fighters grab each other and struggle around a bit, throwing in some close punches or knees along the way, now controls a lot more like the ground game, requiring sweeps of the right stick to pummel for position. You can also press fighters up against the cage from the clinch, leaving them with fewer ways to escape. The submission side of things has been given a new layer of depth with submission transitions. Some fighters can go from one submission attempt directly into another, which requires the defending player to alter the way he's trying to escape from the hold. Also, button mashing for submission escapes and other spots in the game has been completely removed in favor of rotating the right stick.<br/> <br/> Things like the way fighting styles are assigned to fighters have also changed. Instead of just picking a couple of styles and getting all of the moves that come with it, created fighters can be pieced together, one move at a time. There are still plenty of templates for those of you who don't want to get that specific, though. The combo system has also been changed, relying on the natural chaining of moves based on how long their animations take to complete, rather than using canned, style-specific combos. This will feel like a fairly subtle change if you didn't spend a lot of time with last year's game, but it makes all of the combat feel a little more natural and fluid.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28122/1365048-s073.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1365048\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.72413793103448\" data-width=\"290\" style=\"width: 290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28122/1365048-s073.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1365048\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28122/1365048-s073.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The new clinch is easier to understand than last year's.</figcaption></figure>     With all of these changes and the game's completely functional online mode, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29376\" href=\"/ufc-undisputed-2010/3030-29376/\" slug=\"ufc-undisputed-2010\">UFC Undisputed 2010</a> is a better game than its predecessor. But if you're looking for something to do by yourself, you might not be as pleased with the single-player side of UFC. Last year's career mode was complicated by silly hassles like constantly modifying the logos on your trunks to ensure you were getting the appropriate sponsor bonuses and an e-mail system that weighed you down with a lot of useless chatter. This year's career mode actually adds some nice depth by giving your created fighter a voice, which he uses in vignettes like post-fight interviews, where you'll get a simple dialogue tree to give a little personality to your character. But things like determining your training regimen have been complicated a great deal. Now, stats that you don't focus on will eventually deteriorate, even when you're a young fighter. It makes the career mode feel like an elaborate math problem combined with spinning plates. If you like a serious amount of depth in your career modes, you'll probably like the changes, but all of this was enough to completely scare me away from the career mode after a few fights.<br/> <br/> Other single-player options include a title fight ladder mode, a title defense mode where you have to keep your belt after completing the title mode, a configurable tournament bracket, and things like that. The \"ultimate fights\" mode from last year's game returns, and it feels even more like the \"relive or rewrite history\" aspect of <a data-ref-id=\"3010-15\" href=\"/thq/3010-15/\" slug=\"thq\">THQ</a>'s <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20723\" href=\"/wwe-legends-of-wrestlemania/3030-20723/\" slug=\"wwe-legends-of-wrestlemania\">WWE Legends of WrestleMania</a>. You'll have to complete specific tasks over the course of a fight to satisfy the requirements and unlock additional content. There's also an event mode, where you can build your own eight-match fight card. Events play out a bit more like UFC pay-per-views do on television, with additional graphics and introductions that showcase each fighter. It's a neat idea, and you can just watch the AI fight out your created card, if you like.<br/> <br/> UFC Undisputed 2010 comes with a single-use code that is used to unlock the online side of the game. That's nothing new, but the way it conveys this information is particularly poor. The Xbox 360 version of the game checks for downloadable content and pops up a store window asking you to pay $5.00 for the ability to play online. If you correctly deny that, it then makes its way to the main menu, where it tells you you'll need to enter a code from the manual to play online (or pay that $5.00 if you're renting or playing a used copy). I shudder to think about how many people went ahead and bought the online access, not realizing that the game came with a code. Sure enough, message boards across the Internet are flaring up from time to time as someone unwraps the game and thinks that they're being expected to pay another five bones. It's an <i>awful</i> way to implement this sort of first-sale code idea.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28122/1364930-s109.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1364930\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.72413793103448\" data-width=\"290\" style=\"width: 290px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:72.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28122/1364930-s109.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1364930\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28122/1364930-s109.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28122/1364930-s109.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>You can unlock additional victory and entrance animations for your fighters.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     Like last year's game, UFC 2010 looks great. You'll still notice some clipping here and there (hands tend to clip into the backs of heads when on the ground, for example), but the animation looks nice and the fighter models are great. The audio portion of the program ditches all of the \"edgy\" licensed music from the previous entry in favor of more stock-sounding UFC music, and the commentary has been updated. You won't hear the two-man team constantly shout \"ground and pound\" if you get into a flurry of ground punches anymore. It's more varied across the board, but it's also not specific enough. Hearing Joe Rogan talk about a cut that is gushing a lot of blood is pretty useless, since he doesn't bother to point out which fighter's been cut. With the way the camera angles work, it's usually tough to tell who's bleeding when it first happens.<br/> <br/> Better fighting and deeper online support with a clan-like \"fight camp\" system make UFC 2010 Undisputed a better-playing game than its predecessor, but its solo side is a pretty dry.

But it's the robust set of content-creation tools, and all the absurdity they enable, that make the game really memorable. ModNation provides a good mix of madcap weapon-based racing action with actual depth, and the sort of gleeful large-scale copyright infringement that only user-generated content can provide. As long as Sony's legal department doesn't get involved, this game will let you race as many tracks using as many characters and karts as you can download or create yourself.<br/> <br/> There's nothing too surprising about the core kart-racin' formula here. You drift around curves, kicking up sparks as you go, and pick up weapons from little power-up boxes scattered around the track. Those weapons mostly fit into archetypal <a data-ref-id=\"3055-309\" href=\"/koopa-shell/3055-309/\" slug=\"koopa-shell\">red shell</a>-style categories, but you can power each weapon up by picking up extra boxes before you use it to change its properties and make it more devastating. The best thing about the racing system is the boost meter. You build it up slowly by doing anything the game considers a trick--powersliding, drafting, midair 360s, and so on--and then cash it in to... go faster. Crazy, right?<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1385798-modnation_oldsnkaeisnotpleased.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1385798\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56303837118246\" data-width=\"1277\" style=\"width: 1277px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1385798-modnation_oldsnkaeisnotpleased.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1385798\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1385798-modnation_oldsnkaeisnotpleased.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Old Snake loves kart racing!</figcaption></figure>     But that's not all the boost meter is useful for. You can also use it to create an energy shield around your kart, which is crucial when you're about to get hit with something you can't avoid, like a homing missile. You can also cash in a chunk of the meter to physically kart-check a driver on either side of you. So there's a fast-paced risk/reward system at work here that encourages you to do tricks as often as possible to keep your boost meter high, and then makes you intelligently decide whether you want to use the meter offensively to get ahead, or save it up to save your butt when you're under attack.<br/> <br/> ModNation has your standard run of racing modes: career, quick race, and online multiplayer races that you can play as simple pick-up races or as \"XP\" races that will level up your persistent online dude. There are enough pre-made tracks included with the game to keep you busy for a while, and every career race has a number of pretty demanding challenges attached to it--stuff like \"rack up 140,000 drift points\" or \"take out three opponents with a level 3 weapon\"--that make them worth replaying, especially since each challenge unlocks plenty of trinkets like new clothing and accessories, track parts, not to mention entire new karts, when you meet them.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1385797-modnation_career.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1385797\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56053459119497\" data-width=\"1272\" style=\"width: 1272px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.1%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1385797-modnation_career.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1385797\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1385797-modnation_career.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1385797-modnation_career.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The game does a good job of integrating your creations into the action.</figcaption></figure>     If you never took ModNation Racers online, you'd mostly miss the point, though. The game's default vinyl-figure-looking characters and tracks don't have a ton of personality to them. They get the job done, but in a genre where character heavyweights like <a data-ref-id=\"3005-177\" href=\"/mario/3005-177/\" slug=\"mario\">Mario</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-73\" href=\"/sonic-the-hedgehog/3005-73/\" slug=\"sonic-the-hedgehog\">Sonic</a> hold sway, these nameless dudes don't really cut it. That's why ModNation demands that you hit the Internet and see all the truly ludicrous, random tracks, karts, and drivers (called mods) that the community has cooked up. The creation tools for all categories offer as much complexity as you want to make use of, and the more time you want to put in, the better the results you'll get. There's next to no learning curve with these tools, though; if you want to just try your hand at making a new mod, it's easy enough to make a cool-looking dude even if you don't want to shape primitives into facial features or tweak the scale and orientation of the eyes. The track editor is similarly easy to use; you can lay down track with an interface that's almost as easy as driving on it, and the game will auto-populate your course with props if you don't want to set them all by hand.<br/> <br/> In full disclosure, I really couldn't care less about making my own stuff in a game like this. But that doesn't matter, because plenty of creative people are already out there, cranking out tons of neat stuff to download.

All that stuff is already available for quick download in the game, only a day or two after it hit shelves.

For whatever reason, the load times range from barely tolerable to atrocious. It can take what seems like forever to get into an actual career race, and even accessing the game's main menu--which you navigate by driving around in it--makes you stare at a slowly moving loading percentage. (That's extra baffling since you can also access all of the same functionality from a traditional pop-up menu once you're in this lobby area.) The game's performance can also hitch up here and there, and I got disconnected from the online servers off and on, but those things mostly only happened in that lobby area. It would have been nice to toggle that off and just do everything from a standard menu, but hopefully these things will be ironed out as the online support matures.<br/> <br/> My only fear about ModNation Racers is that copyright will soon prevail and Sony will go in and remove a lot of the craziness from the game's online network. The framework for a raucous multiplayer experience is in place here, and as long as the community's wacky laissez-faire attitude toward user-created content is allowed to persist, ModNation Racers will be an amusing kart-racing sandbox to drive around in. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "Creative users have already made ModNation Racers a ridiculous kart-racing good time.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-289/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-26848/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/modnation-racers/3030-26848/", "id": 26848, "name": "ModNation Racers"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-05-26 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-84174/", "id": 84174, "name": "ModNation Racers"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/alpha-protocol-review/1900-290/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112176-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_042.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1112176\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112176-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_042.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1112176\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1112176-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_042.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Place points in stealth and you can literally become invisible for short stretches of time.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     I'm always game for a good spy story, but the traditional treatment of espionage in video games leaves a little something to be desired.

Also, a thin layer of buggy, unpolished grime permeates just about every aspect of the game, muting its high points until much of the final product feels like a mess.<br/> <br/> The game puts you in the role of <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2474\" href=\"/michael-thorton/3005-2474/\" slug=\"michael-thorton\">Michael Thorton</a>. He's the new guy at an ultra-secret, above-the-law spy organization called Alpha Protocol. The game opens with Michael getting ready for his first assignment, which sends him to <a data-ref-id=\"3035-1612\" href=\"/saudi-arabia/3035-1612/\" slug=\"saudi-arabia\">Saudi Arabia</a> on the trail of some terrorists who have come into possession of some American-made missiles, which they promptly use to shoot down a civilian airliner. But as you get closer to the truth behind these missiles, your new buddies back at home base decide you're something of a liability. This puts you in place to unravel a conspiracy involving the defense contractor--known as Halbech--that built those missiles in the first place, along with voting machines, Middle East construction projects, and just about any other recent hot-button item that can make the corporation seem shadier than Haliburton and Blackwater combined.\u00a0<br/>\u00a0<br/>While the facts of the adventure remain mostly the same, how you handle your relationships with others has a big impact on how it all plays out.\u00a0As you play, you'll be put into several situations where you can decide who lives and who dies. Even after most boss fights, which see you filling your opponent full of lead, you're given a chance to spare their lives. This lets you form alliances or rivalries with a number of different factions, from terrorist organizations to Asian gangs to the Chinese secret police. This gives you an opportunity for noticeable benefits, like allies that will join you in some of the more gun-heavy missions or the ability to purchase additional weapons and upgrades. But the way the game interprets your actions and feeds them back to you goes deeper than merely letting people live or die.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112181-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_047.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1112181\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112181-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_047.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1112181\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1112181-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_047.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0In the safehouse you can change your loadout and read e-mails.</figcaption></figure>     In one mission, for example, you're infiltrating a warehouse belonging to an organization known as G22. Depending on how you've handled past run-ins with this group, you could be allied with them or completely at odds with their existence. In my case, we were friendly. The mission has you place bugs on G22's servers to listen in on their network traffic in hopes of learning more about your current mission, which at that point, has very little to do with G22. If you're spotted during the mission, you'll receive a call from your contact, wondering what in the hell you've been doing. Then you're faced with a choice: do you turn off your monitoring software to stay in G22's good graces, or do you let them run and make another new enemy? Keep in mind that you'll go in with less information about your next mission if you decide to comply with G22's request. The choices feel layered and meaningful, and it's impressive how frequently your actions come back around. This sprawls all the way out to the game's conclusion, which can go a number of different ways. At the end, I took down the evil corporation behind the entire affair. But if things play out differently, you might just be trying to join them... or maybe take them out so you can replace them with something even more insidiously self-serving. Alpha Protocol handles choice and the alteration of different story threads better than most games, and it's definitely the game's biggest strength.<br/> <br/> You'll also do a lot of talking in Alpha Protocol. The game has Mass Effect-like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-77\" href=\"/dialogue-trees/3015-77/\" slug=\"dialogue-trees\">dialogue trees</a> with a couple of key differences. First, the game doesn't really spell out exactly what your dialogue options are. Rather than reading lines of text before picking what you want to say, you press different buttons to control the attitude of your response. You can respond professionally, aggressively, or smoothly, most of the time. The different characters you meet like to be treated differently, so you can go \"suave\" with Mina, one of your mission handlers, to flirt with her. Meanwhile, no-nonsense guys like Alan Parker, one of the other Alpha Protocol analysts, prefer a professional approach. The other big change is that the game doesn't let you take forever to make up your mind. The dialogue choices and a timer bar appear while the other character is still talking, so you don't have much time to decide. This forces you to think on your feet and stay engaged during cutscenes. It's pretty cool. You'll learn more about the various players in the universe by talking to them or about them with others. In fact, some missions contain no combat at all, focusing entirely on dialogue. This goes a long way toward making Alpha Protocol feel like more than just a third-person shooter with some stealth mechanics.<br/> <br/> It's a good thing that the dialogue and alternate paths in Alpha Protocol can be so interesting, because the action is really deflating. Granted, Alpha Protocol focuses more on its RPG aspects than its shooting, but firing a weapon is still extremely unsatisfying. At the beginning of the game, before you've put upgrade points into any of the four weapon categories, Thorton fires a weapon as if he's never even <i>seen</i> a gun before and is saddled with poor <a data-ref-id=\"3015-55\" href=\"/cover-system/3015-55/\" slug=\"cover-system\">cover mechanics</a>, as well. Your shots are wildly inaccurate and mostly ineffective. As a direct result, I ended up funneling most of my upgrade points, which are earned by leveling up, into stealth. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-24\" href=\"/stealth/3015-24/\" slug=\"stealth\">Stealth</a> in Alpha Protocol is a little silly, as you'll earn abilities that essentially make you invisible. Running around in slow-motion for 20 seconds, performing silent takedowns on enemies as their friends watch, only to have those friends be completely unable to detect you is squarely at odds with the rest of the game's reasonably realistic presentation. But once you get past that, slinking around and choking guys out is at least more satisfying than the subpar gunplay.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112164-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_030.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1112164\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0\" style=\"width: 1px\"><a  href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1112164-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_030.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1112164\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1112164-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_030.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1112164-t_alphaprotocol_sdcc09_walkthrtr_pt2_hd_030.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0People like Sie can be powerful allies, if you treat her right.</figcaption></figure>     As if there wasn't already enough of a tug-of-war between Alpha Protocol's highs and lows, the game is saddled with a variety of technical issues. The frame rate on the PlayStation 3 version seems less stable than its 360 counterpart, but both versions contain some ugly, low-resolution textures and stuttery animation. I also ran into multiple cases in both versions where a door--one you absolutely must walk through to move forward--opened and then immediately closed itself. Once closed, the prompt to open the door wouldn't reappear, forcing a reload of the last checkpoint.<br/> <br/> There's some good writing in Alpha Protocol and the voice cast is mostly able to back that up. Since you can play the game with a few different attitudes, the actor handling the main character has to play some lines with different tones. His \"professional\" and \"suave\" tones work a lot better than his aggressive tone, which sounds a little forced and less believable than the rest. Also, it must be said that Alpha Protocol contains <a data-ref-id=\"3040-80008\" href=\"/nolan-north/3040-80008/\" slug=\"nolan-north\">Nolan North</a>, who turns in a great, non-<a data-ref-id=\"3005-162\" href=\"/nathan-drake/3005-162/\" slug=\"nathan-drake\">Drake</a>-like performance.<br/> <br/> If you decide to play Alpha Protocol, just know that your main enemies over the course of its 15-or-so hours will be its collection of misery-inducing technical issues and the clash between its action and role-playing elements.

At the end of <a data-ref-id=\"3030-24667\" href=\"/the-beatles-rock-band/3030-24667/reviews/\" slug=\"the-beatles-rock-band\">my review of that game</a>, I posited that there might not be another band out there \"important\" enough to warrant such treatment, and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29439\" href=\"/green-day-rock-band/3030-29439/\" slug=\"green-day-rock-band\">Green Day: Rock Band</a> kind of proves that point. I'm a fan of Green Day, and I thoroughly enjoyed my time with Green Day: Rock Band, but there's nothing about this package that transcends its parts, despite the game's structural similarities to The Beatles: Rock Band. This is a game for Green Day fans that have been waiting to play some of the pop-punk stalwarts' music in a Rock Band game, and as competently built as it is, it has little value for those who don't fall within that specific Venn Diagram overlap. As fan service it's pretty terrific, but it's no cultural event, and there's no relevance beyond that face value.<br/> <br/> That said, I think Green Day, as a band, pretty well justifies the Rock Band treatment. Starting with <i>Dookie</i> and ending with <i>21st Century Breakdown</i>, there's a distinct through-line for the band's musical progression, which goes from snotty pop punk about boredom and masturbation to a ballsy, full-production punk rock opera, with the music's catchiness being the most obvious consistency. The game charts this progression over a series of three different venues, each marking a key stage in the band's development. The warehouse venue represents Green Day's early days, relatively speaking, while the Milton Keynes venue--where Green Day shot its <i>Bullet in a Bible</i> concert DVD--represents the band's<i> American Idiot</i>-era resurgence, and the Fox Theater serves as showcase for the band's <i>21st Century Breakdown</i> material. Like the band's music, the stages become more and more ostentatious and theatrical as you progress, though a mere three stages for 16 years of music feels a little thin. Licensing issues be damned, but I feel like the absence of a mud-caked Woodstock 94 venue neglects one of Green Day's most well-known and career-defining live performances.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1395913-hud_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1395913\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4000\" style=\"width: 4000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1395913-hud_03.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1395913\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1395913-hud_03.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Dreams come true for Green Day fans on this boulevard.</figcaption></figure>     While I found the number of venues lacking, the band itself tends to keep things interesting, with different era-appropriate looks and some really spot-on motion-capture that ably conveys Green Day's on-stage personality. More importantly, the 47 songs included with the game feature every Green Day song I'd want to play in a Rock Band game, and then some. With this you get <i>Dookie</i> in its entirety, the hits from <i>Insomniac</i>, <i>Nimrod</i>, and <i>Warning</i>, everything from <i>American Idiot</i>, and the handful of tracks from <i>21st Century Breakdown</i> that haven't already been released as general Rock Band DLC. I might bellyache over the fact that these previously released songs aren't bundled here if I found that material as compelling as the band's earlier stuff. Unlike The Beatles: Rock Band, the songs here are fully exportable for play in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20714\" href=\"/rock-band-2/3030-20714/\" slug=\"rock-band-2\">Rock Band 2</a> (and, when it comes out, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-27919\" href=\"/rock-band-3/3030-27919/\" slug=\"rock-band-3\">Rock Band 3</a>,) though you'll have to pay a $10 export fee, which is double what past <a data-ref-id=\"3025-567\" href=\"/rock-band/3025-567/\" slug=\"rock-band\">Rock Band</a> games have charged for this convenience. Still, $70 for 47 songs is cheaper than what you'd pay for all those tracks as piecemeal DLC at the current going rates... assuming you'd actually want every song included.\u00a0<br/> <br/> If you're the type of Green Day fan that would want all those songs, though, you'll probably appreciate all of the game's bonus material. There are tons of publicity and candid photos of the band for you to unlock and peruse, as well as a sampling of great MTV-sourced interview and performance footage of the band that you'll unlock by completing specific challenges which reveal themselves as you play through the career. As someone who grew up in the mid-1990s with Green Day, I found a lot of this archival footage particularly compelling in a time-capsule sort of way.\u00a0<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1395915-hud_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1395915\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"4000\" style=\"width: 4000px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/27/1395915-hud_01.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1395915\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1395915-hud_01.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/27/1395915-hud_01.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0And uhh... Geek Stink Breath. Yeah, I got nothing here.</figcaption></figure>     If you're a Rock Band fan first and Green Day second, you'll find that the level of challenge here falls somewhere in between what Rock Band 2 and The Beatles: Rock Band offered. Green Day's music errs towards pretty speedy, straight-ahead stuff, but\u00a0<a data-ref-id=\"3005-13400\" href=\"/billie-joe-armstrong/3005-13400/\" slug=\"billie-joe-armstrong\">Billie Joe Armstrong</a> tends to sing in a range that I found far more approachable than most music games, the three-part harmonies are simpler, and thus, easier than what was found in The Beatles: Rock Band, and bassist <a data-ref-id=\"3005-13399\" href=\"/mike-dirnt/3005-13399/\" slug=\"mike-dirnt\">Mike Dirnt</a> has a knack for walking bass lines that translate into fun, interesting gameplay.<br/> <br/> Aside from a few more venues, there's not much more that I'd want from such a package that isn't present here. And yet, for all the points that I've made here for and against Green Day: Rock Band, it's all pretty ancillary to the fundamental truth that, if you don't like Green Day, and you don't want to play their music in a Rock Band game, you're not going to get a whole lot out of Green Day: Rock Band.", "deck": "Green Day: Rock Band makes good on the promises implicit in the title, but it requires an appreciation of both Green Day and Rock Band to really enjoy.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-291/", "platforms": "PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29439/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/green-day-rock-band/3030-29439/", "id": 29439, "name": "Green Day: Rock Band"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-06-07 21:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-90966/", "id": 90966, "name": "Green Day: Rock Band"}, "reviewer": "Ryan"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/backbreaker-review/1900-292/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/587885-backbreaker13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-587885\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1570/587885-backbreaker13.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-587885\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/1570/587885-backbreaker13.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Do you like seeing people get hit excruciatingly hard? Backbreaker gives you that in spades.</figcaption></figure>     A video game is more than the technology behind it. It has to be, because technology alone is  not inherently fun; you have to surround that tech with mechanics and  art and audio and everything else that goes into making a proper gaming  experience. <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20986\" href=\"/backbreaker/3030-20986/\" slug=\"backbreaker\">     Backbreaker </a>does not successfully do this. It is a tech demo  masquerading as a video game, an animation engine trying to carry the  weight of a $50 title all by its lonesome. Under that considerable  weight, its back is what is ultimately broken, collapsing into a  crumpled pile of half-baked gameplay and characterless presentation.<br/> <br/>Oh, Backbreaker is a football game, in case you were wondering, the  latest attempt by an upstart developer to provide some kind of NFL-less  alternative to the unstoppable, world-consuming behemoth that is EA's <a data-ref-id=\"3025-491\" href=\"/madden-nfl/3025-491/\" slug=\"madden-nfl\">     Madden </a>franchise. I am always disappointed when these titles don't find a  way to circumvent Madden's seemingly monolithic status, but try as it  might, developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6302\" href=\"/naturalmotion/3010-6302/\" slug=\"naturalmotion\">   NaturalMotion</a> doesn't end up making much of a  compelling argument to put Madden aside this year in favor of its debut  title.<br/> <br/>Backbreaker's key feature is its animation system. NaturalMotion has  developed its own technology that ensures that hits and tackles develop  in real time. No canned animations, no reused hits. The way bodies  slam, bang, and fly through the air is completely unique each and every  time out. In that regard, Backbreaker is occasionally a hoot. Sacks in  particular often look delightfully brutal, and it's never not fun to  watch a prissy wide receiver get spun around in the air by two  linebackers coming from either direction. Even the standard tackles,  shoves, leg trips, and whatever else look pretty cool as well. <br/> <br/>It's just a shame that these hits, so much the focus of the game,  aren't presented better. Player models are so generic and bland you  might as well be playing on a Foosball table, and the camera angles are a  mess. Strictly speaking from a replay point of view, the lack of  ability to change the camera when you're watching one of your  brilliantly timed sacks is pretty annoying. More annoying is the camera  you're presented with on the field. This is one of those games that  wants to put you as close to the action as humanly possible, and in  doing so, more or less destroys your ability to play effectively. <br/> <br/>As the quarterback, for instance, once you snap the ball, you're  pushed in so close that it's damn near impossible to see the scope of  the field. Football purists will no doubt argue that this is \"realistic\"  and that Madden's method of letting you zoom back and see practically  the entire length of the field isn't. Fine, it's not realistic. It's  also not fun. It might have been, were it easier to throw the ball, but  regrettably, Backbreaker is one of those games that seeks to fix  problems that don't exist. Passing is mapped to the right control  stick, and once you snap the ball, your QB is locked to a single  receiver, until you enter a \"focus\" mode that lets you snap from  receiver to receiver by (again) flicking the control stick. When you're  in this focus mode, the camera zooms even closer, making it even tougher  to see what's going on. <br/> <br/>With practice, this system can be reasoned with, but eventually you  start bumping up against other problems, like the fact that the game was  balanced by some kind of offense-hating lunatic. I played around with  something like 20 of the game's 40-some-odd generic teams, and with each  one, I was saddled with an offensive line that ranged from somewhat  porous to functionally inept. Sacks happen with such frequency that at  some point the novelty of seeing them wears off entirely. When you do  manage to get the ball off, the interception-happy defense is right  there to ensure you have no chance of driving down the field. Don't  worry, it goes both ways. On defense, I collected more than my share of  sacks and bizarre interceptions, mostly by running the same three or  four blitz packages over and over again. Fumbles are funny, too. They  happen less often than INTs, though sometimes those \"fumbles\" turn out  to be awkward forward passes. The game apparently can't tell the  difference.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22178/1227938-bb1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1227938\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.51612903225806\" data-width=\"806\" style=\"width: 806px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:51.6%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/22178/1227938-bb1.png\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1227938\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/2/22178/1227938-bb1.png\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Do you like running, passing or anything else that isn't tackling? Backbreaker doesn't do those things so well...</figcaption></figure>     There is a running game of sorts in Backbreaker, and should you  master it, you have a good shot of dominating.  All you really have at your disposal are some basic jukes and stiff-arms  and spins. The timing on these moves is kind of messed up, (you pretty  much have to decide to juke or spin before you even know someone's  coming at you), but should you get the hang of these moves, Lord help  the less-experienced player or boneheaded AI opponent that goes up  against you. I have seen players rack up gaggles of points online just  by running the same few running plays again and again. I'll cop to a bit  of defensive bewilderment from time to time, but the way my computer  cohorts seemed to just buckle under the stress of trying to deal with  one seemingly inhuman running back struck as, well, problematic.<br/> <br/>So, suffice it to say, Backbreaker has its share of gameplay issues.  It's not realistic enough to challenge Madden as a sim, but it's not  arcadey or crazy enough to even challenge something like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-563\" href=\"/blitz-the-league/3025-563/\" slug=\"blitz-the-league\"> Blitz: The  League</a>. In a lot of ways, it's reminiscent of the ill-conceived <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21512\" href=\"/nfl-blitz-pro/3030-21512/\" slug=\"nfl-blitz-pro\">  NFL  Blitz Pro</a>, another attempt to hybrid the arcade and the realistic into  something unique. But like that game, it ultimately ends up feeling like  an unfocused hodgepodge. <br/> <br/>Nothing on hand supplements those gameplay problems, either. You  have a couple of league modes to play around with, including one that  lets you customize and build not only your own team, but also your own  league of 8, 16, or 32 teams, complete with divisions of your choosing.  Customization in major sports titles is always something that seems  lacking (due likely in no small part to licensing restrictions), so it's  nice to see a decent spate of creation options here. But in the end  you're creating a team that has to play the same clunky game of football  that all the other generic teams in the game do, so the effort seems  for naught. Online modes are standard, and though I did run into some  weird herky-jerkiness with lag here and there, it never became  unplayable.<br/> <br/>There is, additionally, a minigame mode called Tackle Alley. This  can be played offline or on (the difference being another player running  around on the field with you online), and your goal is simple: Play as a  ball-carrier, and avoid waves of would-be tacklers. Ironically, this is  probably the most fun you'll have with Backbreaker, though you'll  probably enjoy it more in iPhone form. This specific minigame is  available on the service for $0.99, and on top of being way cheaper than  this full game, it actually features better, more responsive controls.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1398375-photo_20050804092006_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398375\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.75\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:75.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/39/1398375-photo_20050804092006_0.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398375\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/1398375-photo_20050804092006_0.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/39/1398375-photo_20050804092006_0.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0This is either going to be your new favorite band, or you're going to kill yourself. There are no other alternatives.</figcaption></figure>     As a quick aside, it should be noted that you should not play  Backbreaker unless P.O.D. is your favorite band of all time. For reasons  beyond reason, the developers have included the band's song \"Boom\" as  the background noise for <i>every single kickoff. </i>There are  something like two other songs licensed throughout the entirety of the  game, but you won't hear them even a fraction of the number of times you  hear this song. Music licensing is expensive, I get that. This is still  absurd.<br/> <br/>It should be said that Backbreaker is, in the end, not an entirely  unpleasant experience. Its animation system, over-relied-upon as it is,  does manage to impress. But whether or not that animation engine  warranted an entirely new game to be built around it is severely  debatable, given the end result here. Someone should do something with  this technology and put it to better use in a better game. As for  Backbreaker?

The new port to Xbox Live Arcade comes with redrawn high-def artwork, a bizarre online multiplayer mode, and the subtitle <a data-ref-id=\"3030-35325\" href=\"/half-minute-hero-super-mega-neo-climax/3030-35325/\" slug=\"half-minute-hero-super-mega-neo-climax\">Super Mega Neo Climax</a>, which makes roughly as much sense as anything else in this truly odd game. Actually, the best enhancement to this new version is exposure to a wider audience. At what's now considered a modest downloadable price of $10, it's worth tuning in just to witness the baffling humor and hyperkinetic spectacle that is Half-Minute Hero.</p><p style=\"\">Superficially, everything about the game comes straight from the 16-bit RPG classics of the '90s. There's a new magic spell making the rounds on the evil-bad-guy scene that destroys all of creation 30 seconds after it's uttered, and naturally you're the only hero fast and strong enough to stop one \"evil lord\" after another from getting their rocks off by undoing everything that is. Except, instead of spending 30 hours leveling up your character and questing across the land to take down the bad guy du jour, you spend 30 seconds. There's simple comedic value in the speed that your little sprite dude zooms around the overworld map and powers through random battles without any input from you. Not only do you level up after practically every battle, sometimes you gain three or four levels at once. I'm not going to lie, after spending dozens of hours grinding through character progression in plenty of other RPGs, getting to level 30 in a matter of seconds is a pretty thrilling thing.</p><p style=\"\">The game has a really odd structure that sends you through a main quest comprised of around 30 missions, then has you play a number of epilogue quests with different characters before reconvening for a five-minute showdown (truly epic by this game's standards) with the ultimate evil. Each of the 30-second quests in that main campaign actually breaks down more like a short puzzle than a bonafide RPG experience, though. Since you've got that timer incessantly ticking down until the world ends, you're hauling ass between towns and caves, keeps, and dungeons trying to level up and fulfill any specific quest objectives before time runs out. Your saving grace is that a wisecracking goddess of time will reset the counter back to 30 whenever you lavish tithes upon her back in town, so you can grind out cash and then pay to extend your questing time. The catch is, the goddess's price goes up every time you use her services, so there's a balancing act going on where you're trying to cram in more activity in a given quest without pricing yourself out of the ability to keep resetting time at all.</p><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/1793365-hmh1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1793365\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56328125\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33880/1793365-hmh1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1793365\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/3/33880/1793365-hmh1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>The XBLA version offers new-school HD artwork.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">Since the game is inherently lampooning the idea that traditional RPGs are too slow and repetitive, it's ironic that Half-Minute Hero almost gets too repetitive itself. The core of what you're doing--leveling up and gaining some new weapons and companions so you can go kill yet another big bad--never changes, and that repetition starts to feel a little like a grind after a while. Luckily the game's humor is positively daft, and it's worth plowing through all those quests just to see what nonsense they throw at you next. One of the bosses is a giant bat named... Badbat, and other bosses take the form of crabs, giant feet, and trees. The goddess of time is fond of awful wordplay but then turns right around and mocks herself for it. Other characters make referential jokes about the game reusing sprites from earlier quests. It's impossible not to grin or even laugh out loud regularly while you play through this game.</p><p style=\"\">This XBLA port features a full visual overhaul in HD, which is subject to taste. I found some of the art to be splendid and other parts questionable, but regardless of style or quality, there's something satisfying about seeing your hero wearing a barrel as a suit of armor, or decking himself out in snorkeling gear and flippers so he can cross a 16-bit waterway from island to island. The PSP version's original retro graphics are also still in here, if you prefer those. I appreciated their inclusion, but in some cases the sprites were blown up so big on a normal-sized television that they were kind of hard to look at and interpret as meaningful images. Your experience may vary. That's the nice thing about having options!<div id=\"incontent_top-wrap\" class=\"mapped-ad mapped-incontent_top mapped-incontent_top-dart\"><div id=\"incontent_top\" class=\"ad-wrap ad-wrap-incontent_top\"></div></div></p><p style=\"\">That \"Super Hero Wars\" multiplayer mode is just as weird as it ought to be, swaddled as it is in all this other lunacy. It pits you against other players to see who can make it through a given quest faster. But there are all these weird limitations in place. For instance, shops only have one of each item to sell, so you're even racing other players just to arm yourself. And only one player at a time sinks their money into resetting the clock, which benefits all players--but if nobody does it, everyone loses. So there are a lot of ways you can screw over the other players to get ahead in the race to beat the boss. (It helps if you cackle while doing this.) The multiplayer is oddly exhilarating, which is definitely a contrast to the slow baby-making jam that plays in the lobby where you set up matches against other people.</p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90221/1793502-20705_189556_6_hd.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1793502\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56328125\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/9/90221/1793502-20705_189556_6_hd.jpeg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1793502\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90221/1793502-20705_189556_6_hd.jpeg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/9/90221/1793502-20705_189556_6_hd.jpeg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>Or you can kick it straight 16-bit.</figcaption></figure><p style=\"\">If you're interested in chasing after completeness (read: achievements), Super Mega Neo Climax has a neat setup that lets you keep track of what you have and haven't done. There are milestones for collecting all the extra weapons and armor, as well as partying up with all the available NPCs, and the game clearly shows your progress on those fronts on a per-mission basis. The path through the main quest branches more than once, so you can also easily go back and follow the other branches to see the quests you missed. And naturally there are leaderboards for getting better times on the previous quests, and the game rewards you for doing things like finishing 10 different missions in less than 30 seconds (real seconds, not turning-back-the-clock goddess ones).</p><p style=\"\">A game that devotes itself so fully to its ridiculous premise deserves to be seen by more people, so it's great that Half-Minute Hero has reappeared with some nice enhancements on a service that more people have access to, and at a price point that doesn't preclude an impulse purchase. I don't know that the core concept has the legs to support a a sequel, but in the here and now I'm awfully glad this game exists.</p>", "deck": "Don't blink or you'll miss this pleasantly ludicrous parody of 16-bit Japanese role-playing games.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-293/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-35325/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/half-minute-hero-super-mega-neo-climax/3030-35325/", "id": 35325, "name": "Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2011-06-29 17:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-111362/", "id": 111362, "name": "Half-Minute Hero: Super Mega Neo Climax"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/transformers-war-for-cybertron-review/1900-294/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/1370950-1273085740_5231_01_0043_20100316_5ihd1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1370950\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/2/28314/1370950-1273085740_5231_01_0043_20100316_5ihd1.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1370950\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/2/28314/1370950-1273085740_5231_01_0043_20100316_5ihd1.jpg\"></a><figcaption>And yeah, he still has that big energy axe.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     When you consider the history of the <a data-ref-id=\"3025-262\" href=\"/transformers/3025-262/\" slug=\"transformers\">Transformers</a> franchise in video games, it's easy to want to celebrate <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29405\" href=\"/transformers-war-for-cybertron/3030-29405/\" slug=\"transformers-war-for-cybertron\">War For Cybertron</a> as some kind of revelation. <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4954\" href=\"/high-moon-studios-inc/3010-4954/\" slug=\"high-moon-studios-inc\">High Moon</a>'s third-person shooter is quite a bit better than just about any Transformers game you could think of. But take it away from those easy comparisons and start to think about third-person shooting at large, and you'll find a pretty cool set of online options that are paired up with shallow, repetitive gameplay that only manages to get by if you've got some sense of nostalgia for the original set of Transformers toys or cartoons.<br/> <br/> The game's story is set before just about every single event you can think of in the Transformers timeline, giving you some information about what the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5006\" href=\"/autobots/3015-5006/\" slug=\"autobots\">Autobots</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3015-5007\" href=\"/decepticons/3015-5007/\" slug=\"decepticons\">Decepticons</a> were doing before they crash-landed on <a data-ref-id=\"3035-65\" href=\"/earth/3035-65/\" slug=\"earth\">Earth</a>. This gives you some Transformer origins, since at the outset of the game, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-151\" href=\"/optimus-prime/3005-151/\" slug=\"optimus-prime\">Optimus Prime</a> is just \"Optimus,\" and he isn't yet the leader of the Autobots. <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1786\" href=\"/starscream/3005-1786/\" slug=\"starscream\">Starscream</a> is unaffiliated, though he quickly falls in line when he first encounters <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2175\" href=\"/megatron/3005-2175/\" slug=\"megatron\">Megatron</a>, who is attempting to infect the planet <a data-ref-id=\"3035-939\" href=\"/cybertron/3035-939/\" slug=\"cybertron\">Cybertron</a> with \"dark energon,\" an unstable form of energy that manifests itself as big crystal formations. The campaign itself is set chronologically, though for the first half of the game you play as the Decepticons, who gain control of the dark energon and use it to subvert the planet and attempt to take over. At halftime, you switch to the Autobot side of things, which is a bit more interesting since the Autobot side tends to actually fight named Decepticons, including fights against Starscream and <a data-ref-id=\"3005-11902\" href=\"/soundwave/3005-11902/\" slug=\"soundwave\">Soundwave</a>. For the most part, both factions are just mercilessly beating up generic drones that take the form of cars, jets, tanks, and so on. These enemies have no personality and aren't much fun to fight. Also, while it's totally understandable why the game's designers would need to cook up a bunch of easily repeatable enemies, it doesn't really feel like Transformers when you're just bashing robot after robot as you trudge ahead.<br/> <br/> The game itself is a third-person shooter that feels like something of a throwback to the days before hiding behind things was so important. Though you can certainly manually stand behind a lot of objects, there's no proper cover system, and the game almost wants to rub it in by occasionally having your AI partners take proper cover during in-game cutscenes. Strafing in and out of cover feels kind of silly. Also, the game is more focused on resource management than you might expect. You're constantly looking for more ammo packs, and there were multiple occasions where I was completely running out of ammo for every single weapon I had on me. Many of the various pistols, launchers, rifles, and sniper weapons also eject cartridges as they're fired, and the weapons don't really feel like the unlimited laser blasts you might expect from a Transformer.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/1285901-5231_01_0005_20091224_ak302.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1285901\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"800\" style=\"width: 800px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/4344/1285901-5231_01_0005_20091224_ak302.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1285901\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/4344/1285901-5231_01_0005_20091224_ak302.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0The cars grip the road when boosting, but typically just hover around at will.</figcaption></figure>     Of course, the big thing about being a Transformer is that you can turn into something else at the touch of a button. Though the toys were often very unique in their transformations, here every character is boiled down into one of four character classes and a couple of different vehicle types. Every single ground-based vehicle, be it a car, truck, or tank, hovers and can strafe back and forth. While each class does get some unique abilities, the similarities between the ground-based vehicles makes most of the vehicle forms feel generic. One class turns into jets, but rather than give you full-on dogfights, these jets sort of hover in place and don't feel as threatening as they probably should. You can boost in each vehicle, too, which gives you a good forward burst of momentum. This leads to what is probably the coolest part about the entire game. When you're driving and boosting ahead, if you transform back into robot form, you'll often slide on your knees for a brief period of time due to all of that speed. It looks pretty rad.<br/> <br/> For the most part, the game looks nice, but the metallic world of Cybertron doesn't lend itself particularly well to a lot of environmental variety. The actual Transformer designs are some of the best around, with robots that sort of split the difference between the original 1980s cartoon designs and their pre-Earth, Cybertronian forms. You'll easily be able to identify guys like Optimus Prime, Soundwave, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-1883\" href=\"/bumblebee/3005-1883/\" slug=\"bumblebee\">Bumblebee</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3005-2964\" href=\"/jazz/3005-2964/\" slug=\"jazz\">Jazz</a>, and others just by appearance. In vehicle form, things get a little crazier, and there's something thematically incorrect about having Soundwave turn into some kind of hover van, though he does turn into something that at least resembles a tape deck during one cutscene. The sound effects are spacey and very heavy on the metal-on-metal contact that you get from running, falling, using a melee attack, or just about anything else. Since the game always has three Transformers together during the campaign, you'll get a fair amount of chatter. The voice of Optimus Prime, <a data-ref-id=\"3040-81906\" href=\"/peter-cullen/3040-81906/\" slug=\"peter-cullen\">Peter Cullen</a>, once again reprises his role in War For Cybertron. He does a good job, but something about the dialogue he's given seems even more overwrought and dramatic than Prime's lines usually do.<br/> <br/> The multiplayer modes let you play any campaign level cooperatively with up to three players. You can jump in or jump out of strangers' games, though the game has to be created as a co-op game--you can't have people join you on the fly if you're starting out in the solo mode. There's also a wave-based survival-type mode called Escalation that feels sort of like the <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20777\" href=\"/call-of-duty-world-at-war/3030-20777/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-world-at-war\">Call of Duty: World At War</a> Nazi Zombies mode, as you'll need to pay off <a data-ref-id=\"3055-200\" href=\"/vending-machine/3055-200/\" slug=\"vending-machine\">vending machines</a> for additional ammo, weapons, and health.

Or, well, actually... how about oily?\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     The main, competitive multiplayer sticks to the player persistence and unlockable add-ons that became so popular back in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2133\" href=\"/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare/3030-2133/\" slug=\"call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare\">Call of Duty 4</a>, but it maintains some semblance of its class-based structure. Each of the four classes gets its own weapon selections and killstreak bonuses, and you'll level up each class individually to unlock additional perks and abilities. Some of these let scouts stay cloaked longer or provide health bonuses to your entire team. Then there's martyrdom, which does exactly what it sounds like, but it drops \"thermo mines\" instead of hand grenades. Some of the similarities seem shameless, but it's a proven system that works, so it's not a negative thing to see this style of multiplayer applied to a very different-feeling game.<br/> <br/> The multiplayer, which allows up to 10 players at once, offers standard shooter modes, like <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">team deathmatch</a>, node control modes, and a couple of takes on capture the flag. Though it sometimes feels like melee attacks are a little too effective, the competitive side of War For Cybertron is its strongest suit. The abilites feel useful and it's way more fun to take on human opposition than it is to grind through the monotonous campaign. It probably won't replace whatever popular shooter you're currently hooked on, but War For Cybertron's multiplayer makes for a good diversion.<br/> <br/> That's really the best thing that can be said about Transformers: War For Cybertron. Its campaign is only worth seeing through if you're extremely curious to see how it ties into some of the other Transformers lore out there, and the multiplayer is solid, if perhaps a bit uninspired. It's a good diversion that'll keep you engaged for a few days, but don't go in expecting long-term excitement. \u00a0 \u00a0", "deck": "War For Cybertron might be the best Transformers game ever made... but that isn't exactly a high bar to best.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-294/", "platforms": "PC, PlayStation 3, Xbox 360", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29405/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/transformers-war-for-cybertron/3030-29405/", "id": 29405, "name": "Transformers: War For Cybertron"}, "score": 3, "publish_date": "2010-06-25 16:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-90681/", "id": 90681, "name": "Transformers: War for Cybertron"}, "reviewer": "Jeff"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/risk-factions-review/1900-295/", "description": "<p style=\"\">If you didn't know any better, you might see a game like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29748\" href=\"/risk-factions/3030-29748/\" slug=\"risk-factions\">          Risk: Factions</a> and assume it came from videogame crack dealer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-293\" href=\"/popcap-games-inc/3010-293/\" slug=\"popcap-games-inc\">         PopCap Games</a>. After all, it's got the simple yet hopelessly addicting gameplay, colorful visuals, bizarre characters, and goofball charm of a typical PopCap release. And that is something of a compliment to <a data-ref-id=\"3010-6256\" href=\"/ea-games/3010-6256/\" slug=\"ea-games\">        EA</a> and developer <a data-ref-id=\"3010-4509\" href=\"/stainless-games-ltd/3010-4509/\" slug=\"stainless-games-ltd\"> Stainless Games</a>, which are the actual brains behind this reworking of the boardgame classic. That this update can invoke the pleasant feelings PopCap games usually tend to speaks highly of its design, and that it still feels like honest-to-God Risk speaks even higher. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Right off the bat, you'll undoubtedly want to know one thing: Can I just play Risk? Yes, you can. The classic strategy boardgame, with its map of the world, numbered units, and dice-rolling attacks are all here in more-or-less untouched fashion. If you like your Risk dry as a corpse in the desert, then you will find precisely what you're looking for here. <br/>\u00a0<br/> </p><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1247275-10.14.61.23_image10copy1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247275\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/3/33529/1247275-10.14.61.23_image10copy1024x576.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1247275\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/3/33529/1247275-10.14.61.23_image10copy1024x576.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Risk just got a whole mess weirder.</figcaption></figure>     But what if you are looking for a bit more in the way of whimsy in your Risk gaming? Factions has you covered. The Factions side of the game takes the core gameplay of Risk, and adds something like a billion new elements to it. Apart from several new maps, all with unique terrain, you'll also find yourself with various objectives and specialized weapons scattered all over the place. All of these revolve specifically around control of specific terrain. For instance, if you control the entirety of the terrain on which the \u201ctemple\u201d weapon is built, and you're able to hold onto it, you can actually convert an enemy space on the board to your own, armies and all. Or, if you control the \u201cdam\u201d portion of the map, you can flood an entire continent and remove all enemy armies from it. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Acquiring these weapons, as well as hitting other objectives on the board (controlling specific continents, invading a certain number of territories in a single turn, etc.), give you badges that not only give you new bonus abilities (like being able to move multiple armies around before the end of your turn, or getting an extra dice to roll with when attacking), but if you collect three of them, you win the game, flat-out. <br/>\u00a0<br/>That little wrinkle there is actually what turns Risk: Factions from a sometimes plodding game to a frequently hectic one. People go balls-out trying to get those objectives filled, because it's a much quicker way to end the game than arduously capturing every territory on the map. <br/>\u00a0<br/>All the objectives and weapons and bonuses and whatnot are a nice boost to the standard Risk gameplay, though there are times when I wish the game had perhaps focused a bit more on a few specific objectives rather than the plethora of sometimes half-baked ones that appear here. It's often difficult to keep track of all the different things you can be capturing on larger maps, and it's incredibly easy to lose track for just a hair long enough for your opponents to trounce you without you ever realizing it. <br/>\u00a0<br/>That all comes with practice, of course, and you'll get a good bit of it in the game's meager single-player campaign, which is really more of a training mode than anything else. Here, you'll learn about the game's five factions--the humans, zombies, robots, yeti, and, my personal favorite, the kitties, led by the vile, Hugo Chavez-esque <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15804\" href=\"/generalissimo-meow/3005-15804/\" slug=\"generalissimo-meow\">    Generalissimo Meow</a>\u2014and the core mechanics of the game as you're treated to cute, mildly amusing cutscenes of each faction's generals setting about warring with one another. The cartoon graphics are quite adorable, especially the little in-game animations of various soldiers on either side killing the living hell out of each other with each dice roll. <br/>\u00a0<br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66392/1415722-snapshot_187.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415722\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"0.66666666666667\" data-width=\"720\" style=\"width: 720px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:66.7%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/6/66392/1415722-snapshot_187.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1415722\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/6/66392/1415722-snapshot_187.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Viva la Purrrrrrevolucion!</figcaption></figure>     Ultimately though, this is a multiplayer-focused game. You're meant to go online and play against friends and strangers, and should you do so, you'll find ample competition. Online play works pretty smoothly, though I did run into some issues with the game freezing when players dropped out of the game, especially if it's the host. Also, let it be known that in games against random players, you'll probably see a lot of people drop out. This is a game that requires some significant time investment, and when people sense they're going to lose, they'll jump ship in a heartbeat. They have to concede the loss if they do, but once they're out of the game, their territories just kind of sit there on the map, waiting to be taken over. No AI players take over or anything. So, all things considered, you're probably best served focusing on playing with people you know. <br/>\u00a0<br/>Like any other boardgame that's made an appearance on <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\" href=\"/xbox-live/3015-1404/\" slug=\"xbox-live\">      Xbox Live</a>, Risk: Factions is going to primarily be appealing to those who like the game on which it's based, regardless of all the fancy upgrades added to the mix. You either think rolling dice and taking over various countries is a lot of fun, or you don't. For my money (in this case, $10 on <a data-ref-id=\"3045-86\" href=\"/xbox-live-marketplace/3045-86/\" slug=\"xbox-live-marketplace\">     Xbox Live Marketplace</a>), I do enjoy me some Risk, and Factions is well worth the price, no matter how you choose to play. \u00a0", "deck": "EA and Stainless Games went ahead and made Risk completely crazy, and Risk: Factions is ultimately better for it.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-295/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29748/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/risk-factions/3030-29748/", "id": 29748, "name": "RISK: Factions"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-06-30 12:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-101515/", "id": 101515, "name": "RISK: Factions"}, "reviewer": "Alex"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/crackdown-2-review/1900-296/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1385283-cd2_may_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1385283\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1385283-cd2_may_05.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1385283\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1385283-cd2_may_05.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Mere vehicles are no match for the Agent.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     While the original <a data-ref-id=\"3030-4065\" href=\"/crackdown/3030-4065/\" slug=\"crackdown\">Crackdown</a> presented players with a handful of goals, its real appeal was as an open environment for players looking to screw around with another player via <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1404\" href=\"/xbox-live/3015-1404/\" slug=\"xbox-live\">Xbox Live</a>. For better or for worse, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-26790\" href=\"/crackdown-2/3030-26790/\" slug=\"crackdown-2\">Crackdown 2</a> picks up precisely where the first game left off. If you're driven by set goals, you'll complete most of the meaningful tasks in around 10 hours, after which you'll probably shrug and move on. But if you're the type to just get in and blow up random cars with a few friends, well, Crackdown 2 can be a lot more than its missions.<br/> <br/> Like the previous game, Crackdown 2 comes to you with a razor-thin premise: you're an agent of The Agency, and your task is to protect <a data-ref-id=\"3035-345\" href=\"/pacific-city/3035-345/\" slug=\"pacific-city\">Pacific City</a>. Two factions are out there, stirring up trouble. Cell is a terrorist group that takes the place of the gangs found in the previous game. The freaks are infected <a data-ref-id=\"3015-733\" href=\"/mutants/3015-733/\" slug=\"mutants\">mutant</a> creatures that roam the streets, spitting up acid and swiping at you with their claws. The freaks are also sensitive to UV light, so your core task is to power up various beacons (which are protected by Cell, who seem to think that the Agency's hiding a cure for the freak virus) and protect light bombs as they charge up to take down underground freak nests. Once you activate all nine of the bombs, there's one last task to complete and then the credits roll. There's no character development as a part of the main storyline, and the only way to glean any sort of meaning out of the game is to find <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2038\" href=\"/audio-logs/3015-2038/\" slug=\"audio-logs\">audio logs</a> laying around the city or explore the various videos and information <a data-ref-id=\"3010-340\" href=\"/microsoft-game-studios/3010-340/\" slug=\"microsoft-game-studios\">Microsoft</a> has pumped out ahead of the game's release. Either way, most of that stuff is meaningless. As before, if you're coming into Crackdown 2 expecting to get some kind of story, you'll be thoroughly disappointed. That said, if you played the first game, you have a pretty good idea about what to expect from both the story and the action.<br/> <br/> There are some gameplay additions and some things in place to take some of the monotony out of the game's more tedious tasks, but by and large, Crackdown 2 is Crackdown 1 with marginally better graphics. The visual enhancement mostly manifests itself as a much longer draw distance, which makes standing on tall buildings and looking around the city pretty cool. While this is the same Pacific City from the first game, the city's fallen on some hard times, so more of the buildings are torn up and there's a darker style to the proceedings. This further manifests itself via the game's day/night cycle, which mostly seems present so that someone could make a great \"the freaks come out at night\" reference. When the sun goes down, the roving Cell vehicles are replaced with streets full of freaks, who come right up out of the ground. It gives the game a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-8720\" href=\"/dead-rising/3030-8720/\" slug=\"dead-rising\">Dead Rising</a> sort of feel, as you're given plenty of opportunities to race through the city streets, mowing down hundreds of freaks as you do so. For the most part, the game can ably handle all of those on-screen enemies, but a few late-game moments have the frame rate chugging a bit more than you'd like.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1268183-x10_game_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1268183\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1920\" style=\"width: 1920px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/26/1268183-x10_game_006.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1268183\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/26/1268183-x10_game_006.jpg\"></a><figcaption>In multiplayer you'll get to be the annoying guy in the helicopter, shooting slow rockets down at the rest of the players.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     The biggest change to the way Crackdown 2 plays is the addition of the wingsuit, a glide ability that lets you sort of fly around the city. It has a <a data-ref-id=\"3030-14727\" href=\"/pilotwings/3030-14727/\" slug=\"pilotwings\">Pilotwings</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-1334\" href=\"/super-mario-world/3030-1334/\" slug=\"super-mario-world\">Super Mario World</a> slant to it, as you'll need to pitch yourself down to pick up speed before you can pull up and turn that speed into lift. But you won't get it until your agility rating is at its maximum level, and it's not especially useful--it's mostly there to give you a set of tasks where you need to glide through some rings placed around the world. Other changes make the race missions easier by removing the time you need to beat to win. Instead, it's more concerned with slapping your times onto an online leaderboard. Also, the cars no longer morph based on your driving skill, so if you don't want to always drive the SUV (or the sluggish tank, which is the last unlockable Agency vehicle), you don't have to. But, like the first game, driving is pretty pointless when you can move faster on foot. The annoying lock-on targeting, which likes to point your weapons at empty vehicles rather than the bad guys standing in front of them, hasn't changed a bit.<br/> <br/> Really, most of the game hasn't changed a bit. The way you jump and the occasional hassle of climbing a building only to find that those windowsills, for some reason, aren't objects you can grab onto are <i>precisely</i> the same as the original game. With most of the additions aimed at streamlining elements of the first game or, at least, making them less of a pain to deal with, Crackdown 2 occasionally feels like a big patch for the first game.<br/> <br/> That's the rub. It's disappointing that so much of Crackdown 2 is completely lifted from the first game, but even though the genre has moved on to bigger and better things, a lot of those things are still fun to do. And those things are made more interesting when added to the inherent excitement that comes from cooperative play. Now you can drag three additional players along with you as you work your way through the city. There's plenty of mayhem-driven fun to be had if you're the sort of player that can appreciate the game's open-ended approach. If you're a fiend for collectibles, the mere thought of running around and collecting more <a data-ref-id=\"3055-868\" href=\"/agility-orb/3055-868/\" slug=\"agility-orb\">agility orbs</a> (including new orbs that try to escape your grasp, which I simply found to be stupid and not worth the effort) probably already has your interest piqued. This time, the game's map tells you which areas still have orbs in them, and you can send out an <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20599\" href=\"/infamous/3030-20599/\" slug=\"infamous\">inFamous</a>-style ping to make orbs show up on your <a data-ref-id=\"3015-185\" href=\"/minimap/3015-185/\" slug=\"minimap\">minimap</a> for a few seconds. You won't need more than half of the game's 500 agility orbs to max out your jumping skills, though, so some casual orb hunting is more than enough to get you pumped up.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1385280-cd2_may_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1385280\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/30/1385280-cd2_may_02.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1385280\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1385280-cd2_may_02.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/30/1385280-cd2_may_02.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Explosions are the name of the game.</figcaption></figure>     I completed the game's primary task in around nine hours, then found myself drawn back in to mop up a few secondary tasks, but after 13 hours total, I've done just about everything I want to do in Crackdown 2, and the ending feels just as tacked-on and thrown together as the rest of the game's \"plot.\" That's when you're supposed to turn to the game's 16-player multiplayer mode, but nothing about that mode is the least bit engaging. Applying the Crackdown mechanics to <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2463\" href=\"/team-deathmatch/3015-2463/\" slug=\"team-deathmatch\">team deathmatch</a> leads to even more annoyance with the game's targeting system. Rocket tag, a game where one player tries to grab an orb and stay alive for as long as possible while the other players--all armed with rocket launchers--blow everything up to get the orb for themselves, is just pure chaos. It's a bad fit for the franchise and probably won't draw your attention away from the main campaign for long.<br/> <br/> There's a narrow subset of people that will absolutely love Crackdown 2 for it's \"it ain't broke, so we didn't fix it\" approach to sequel development. Those people are probably still playing the first Crackdown, though, so they'll be in a perfect position to see just how little some portions of the game have changed. If you're in that group or if you're just looking for something absolutely mindless to do with a few online friends, Crackdown 2 is practically perfect for that.

It sort of defies conventional wisdom that this first real sequel should somehow be <i>more</i> addicting than <a data-ref-id=\"3010-5272\" href=\"/infinite-interactive-pty-ltd/3010-5272/\" slug=\"infinite-interactive-pty-ltd\"> Infinite Interactive</a>'s breakout hybrid puzzle RPG, especially since the company's efforts in between have been less than thrilling. But it's actually <i>because</i> Puzzle Quest 2 is effectively more of the same, and doesn't stray too far from the first game's successful blueprint, that its marriage of puzzles and role-playing is still so appealing.<br/> <br/> Some of Infinite Interactive's other puzzle/RPG hybrids, like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20567\" href=\"/puzzle-quest-galactrix/3030-20567/\" slug=\"puzzle-quest-galactrix\"> Galactrix</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21177\" href=\"/neopets-puzzle-adventure/3030-21177/\" slug=\"neopets-puzzle-adventure\"> Neopets Puzzle Adventure</a>, tried too hard to change up core elements that didn't need changing. No such problem here. Instead of trying to get fancy with new and overly complex puzzle mechanics, the developer kept the part that worked in the original game, namely the traditional match-three puzzle gameplay. But the puzzle-based battles are leaner and more focused on strategy than before. Extraneous pieces like experience gems and coins are gone; now it's just five types of colored mana (for spells), gauntlet-shaped action pieces (for weapon attacks), and skulls (for direct damage) on the board.<br/> <br/> With five types of mana available, there's a greater diversity of spells at your disposal and a wider range of ways you can use them to interact with the pieces on the board and then create utterly devastating combination attacks. The types of spells available depend on your character class--<a data-ref-id=\"3015-3911\" href=\"/barbarians/3015-3911/\" slug=\"barbarians\"> barbarian</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1321\" href=\"/assassin/3015-1321/\" slug=\"assassin\"> assassin</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1291\" href=\"/knight/3015-1291/\" slug=\"knight\"> templar</a>, or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1694\" href=\"/wizards/3015-1694/\" slug=\"wizards\"> sorcerer</a>--and naturally cater to different play styles. I played the hearty, all-around barbarian on the DS version before switching to the less survivable but deadlier assassin on Xbox Live Arcade. Discovering the ins and outs of your class and finding the most efficient ways to slaughter all the monsters in your path is one of the best things about the game.

You find green- and blue-coded loot. You can craft better items out of component materials. Quest givers dispense tons of story-related and optional missions to undertake. Heck, it's so Diablo-like that you start off in a single town with the entrance to a sprawling, multi-level dungeon right outside it. Some of these RPG elements were present in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16014\" href=\"/puzzle-quest-challenge-of-the-warlords/3030-16014/\" slug=\"puzzle-quest-challenge-of-the-warlords\"> the first Puzzle Quest</a>, sure. But like the puzzling mechanics, they also feel more streamlined and cohesive here, and they give you a great reason to keep pushing forward through the increasingly dangerous catacombs.<br/> <br/>  The famously lucky AI (some called it \"cheating\") from the first game is basically nonexistent in this sequel. Enemies rarely get those ridiculous six- and eight-part cascading matches they would routinely get in every battle last time, and even when they do, the effects are far less devastating. If anything, the game almost got too easy as I leveled up, crafted better gear, and figured out more powerful ways to put together all the spells (of which you can only equip five at a time) I was unlocking. Of course, it's always a good idea to prevent the enemy from matching skulls to attack you with, but when you've got a poisoned dagger that does six damage every turn for eight straight turns, a sword that hits for 17 in a single swipe, and spells that can do anywhere from 40 to 100 damage in a single combined assault (depending on the layout of the board), it almost feels like a waste of time doing a paltry three to five damage by matching skulls yourself. I loved the way the combat dynamic evolved to focus more on my unique skills and equipment as my character got more powerful.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/1398873-puzzle_quest_2_ds_0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398873\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"small\" data-ratio=\"1.5\" data-width=\"256\" style=\"width: 256px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:150.0%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/3009/1398873-puzzle_quest_2_ds_0004.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398873\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/1398873-puzzle_quest_2_ds_0004.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_small/0/3009/1398873-puzzle_quest_2_ds_0004.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0The DS version is a pricier but, uh, more  portable way to go.</figcaption></figure> The game does a great job of mixing up the standard puzzling combat with a surprising number of minigame types. These are all variations on the match-three theme that make you do things like matching a quota of specific mechanical gems to pick a lock, matching various types of treasure to determine the quality of loot you'll get from a chest, or filling in a minimum number of squares on the board to bash open a door. These minigames pop up frequently enough and in sufficient variety that you never feel like you're doing too much of one thing at any given time (and even the boards in the battles themselves change pretty dramatically in size and composition, based on the enemy type). For further diversion, all these minigames are available for you to play from the main menu as well, and you can play multiplayer against other players' characters if you feel like it.<br/> <br/>      Looking at screenshots, you might get the impression Puzzle Quest 2 is a full-on dungeon romp, but you don't actually do much exploring. The dungeon screens aren't much more than glorified menus where you click on doorways or characters you want to interact with, and your character merely moves along predefined paths between these points of interest, fighting the enemies that get in the way. This limitation didn't bother me much, since you're still getting to see new areas and enemy types on a regular basis, and there's still a decent amount of freedom to explore the parts of the dungeon you want to explore.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1398440-27951sorcadventuring07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398440\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1450/1398440-27951sorcadventuring07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1398440\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1398440-27951sorcadventuring07.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1450/1398440-27951sorcadventuring07.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0Here is a dungeon. </figcaption></figure> What did sort of bother me was the presentational issues the game has. The DS game is a fair sight smoother and better-looking than the original DS game was, but it can still bog down a bit when a bunch of gems are moving around at once. The minigames on the XBLA version use smaller gems and game boards than the battles, for no apparent reason, and they can be hard to see if you're sitting far from your TV. Neither version communicates information as thoroughly as it should; you're presented with a bunch of arbitrary numbers on the interface around the board, and you have to intuit what they mean over time since there isn't any notation to fill you in. There are a few other nagging issues, like the way tooltips take a second to pop up every time you highlight an item. None of this stuff detracted too much from my enjoyment of the game, but it would be nice if it had a cleaner visual impression.<br/> <br/> It's nice to see Infinite getting back to what made Puzzle Quest great in the first place. This sequel does a fine job of keeping and improving on the good parts while layering on the sort of character progression and strategy that makes you want to keep plowing ahead, long after the game would have otherwise gotten boring. I'd lean toward recommending the Xbox version because, well, I like achievements, and because it's half the price of the DS cart. But whether you want to play on the couch or on the go, Puzzle Quest 2 is a great way to wile away a few minutes, or a few hours.", "deck": "Infinite Interactive takes it back to basics in just the right way with this sequel.", "dlc_name": null, "api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/review/1900-297/", "platforms": "Xbox 360 Games Store, Nintendo DS", "game": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/game/3030-29289/", "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/puzzle-quest-2/3030-29289/", "id": 29289, "name": "Puzzle Quest 2"}, "score": 4, "publish_date": "2010-07-09 18:00:00", "release": {"api_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/api/release/3050-94162/", "id": 94162, "name": "Puzzle Quest 2"}, "reviewer": "Brad"}, {"dlc": null, "site_detail_url": "http://www.giantbomb.com/reviews/singularity-review/1900-298/", "description": "<br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1056022-timewave_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1056022\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.625\" data-width=\"1024\" style=\"width: 1024px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:62.5%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1056022-timewave_001.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1056022\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1056022-timewave_001.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0You'll go back and forth between timelines as you attempt to complete your mission.</figcaption></figure> <a data-ref-id=\"3030-21144\" href=\"/singularity/3030-21144/\" slug=\"singularity\">Singularity</a> has a good atmosphere to it that makes it easy to look past a simple set of abilities that make most of the first-person shooter's puzzle-solving a little too easy to solve. But it's got pretty good shooting and a decent multiplayer mode, too, making for a solid package that's a great fit for fans of story-driven shooters.<br/> <br/> The game casts you as Captain <a data-ref-id=\"3005-15836\" href=\"/nate-renko/3005-15836/\" slug=\"nate-renko\">Nate Renko</a>, and at the opening of the game you're heading out to investigate a Russian island called Katorga-12. The research island, as it turns out, is the home of a substance known as Element 99. The mystical element, discovered by Russian scientists in the 1950s, has time-warping properties, and as the result of Russian experiments gone horribly awry, time is sort of ripping at the seams all over the island. So you'll change history, then change it again, and then maybe change it a few more times over the course of the game. The game does a great job of showing how your minor actions fan out to cause global changes to the power structure of the modern world, and the game has a terrific atmosphere to it that made me want to explore every little hallway in search of audio logs and other little things to help fill in the story. Some of the audio logs are better than others, but overall there's enough good story stuff to keep you focused on progressing through the game. The story works because the game's good at feeding you a lot of misdirection. Since you're making changes to the timeline, it's hard to tell who to trust at any given moment.<br/> <br/> As you work your way across the island, you'll do a lot of shooting. Most of your targets will be Russian soldiers, but there are plenty of messed-up time creatures to dispatch along the way. The game gives you some decent standard weapons to use, like an <a data-ref-id=\"3055-413\" href=\"/assault-rifle/3055-413/\" slug=\"assault-rifle\">assault rifle</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-59\" href=\"/pistol/3055-59/\" slug=\"pistol\">pistol</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3055-114\" href=\"/shotgun/3055-114/\" slug=\"shotgun\">shotgun</a>, or <a data-ref-id=\"3055-288\" href=\"/gatling-gun/3055-288/\" slug=\"gatling-gun\">minigun</a>. But then you've got the sniper rifle, which has a slow-motion feature that makes taking down distant enemies a breeze. Then there's a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-252\" href=\"/grenade-launcher/3055-252/\" slug=\"grenade-launcher\">grenade launcher</a>, which has an alternate mode that fires out a glowing ball that you can control, allowing you to roll grenades right up to enemies before taking them out. Or the spikeshot, which is a <a data-ref-id=\"3055-25\" href=\"/railgun/3055-25/\" slug=\"railgun\">railgun</a> of sorts that fires charged-up slugs that explode shortly after impact. Though you can swap most of these weapons around at will by visiting a weapon station, you also encounter a couple of weapons that are limited-use guns that aren't stored. The coolest of these is the seeker, which is a rifle that fires single shots. The catch is that time slows down when you fire these shots and the game gives you a bullet's eye view of the action, letting you steer your shots into your targets. It's pretty cool.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1056015-52493_singularity_07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1056015\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/1048/1056015-52493_singularity_07.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1056015\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/1048/1056015-52493_singularity_07.jpg\"></a><figcaption>You can freeze enemies inside deadlock bubbles to make them easy targets.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     But guns are only one part of your arsenal. After playing through a prologue-sized chunk of Singularity, you find the Time Manipulation Device, or TMD. This is a glove-like piece of equipment that you'll use to do just about anything that doesn't involve shooting. Its primary function is to phase things back and forth between 2010 and the 1950s, when Katorga-12 went to hell in the first place. So if you find a busted staircase, you can tap your TMD button to set it back to its pristine 1950s state. Broken chalkboards can be reformed and read, mutant plants can be shrunk back down to a manageable size, and old ammo crates can be restored and used. Most of the \"puzzles\" involve aging or restoring various parts of the environment. You can also age enemies, which has different effects on different enemies. Regular troops get turned into dust, but a late-game upgrade lets you turn them into \"reverts,\" which are blind, acid-puking enemies that lash out at anyone they can hear nearby. Aging a revert makes it freak out and eventually explode. Enemies that phase between time periods can be sucked back into your time with a quick jolt from the TMD, opening them up to enemy fire. It's versatile enough to be a useful part of your arsenal, but not so much that you'll use it instead of your guns. Well, most of the time, anyway.<br/> <br/> While the campaign is the main reason to check out Singularity, the multiplayer's pretty decent. The extermination mode pits a team of human players against a team of creepy time monsters in an objective-based match. Playing as the enemy is pretty interesting, and the whole thing is class-based. So you can play as a healer, use teleport abilities, and so on. You can even play as a Phase Tick, which is a little crawling enemy that might as well be the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2253\" href=\"/tickers/3015-2253/\" slug=\"tickers\">Ticker</a> from <a data-ref-id=\"3025-565\" href=\"/gears-of-war/3025-565/\" slug=\"gears-of-war\">Gears of War</a>. When playing as the Phase Tick, you can possess human soldiers, giving you the ability to kill the human team with their own weapons. It's a bit monotonous, and it only has two modes, but the multiplayer's still OK.<br/> <br/> So yeah, what passes for puzzles in the world of Singularity could have been done better, and little things like the way you have to stand near audio logs in order to hear them (which slows down the pace of the game a bit) are sort of annoying.

On the one end you've got games like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-12069\" href=\"/ikaruga/3030-12069/\" slug=\"ikaruga\">Ikaruga</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16952\" href=\"/radiant-silvergun/3030-16952/\" slug=\"radiant-silvergun\">Radiant Silvergun</a>: incredibly focused shooters that distill the genre into its most brutal elements. These are elegantly savage, unforgiving games designed strictly for skill-driven players, or those who simply like to be shamed by their electronics. On the other end there's stuff like <a data-ref-id=\"3030-16481\" href=\"/bangai-o/3030-16481/\" slug=\"bangai-o\">Bangai-O!</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3030-2190\" href=\"/gunstar-heroes/3030-2190/\" slug=\"gunstar-heroes\">Gunstar Heroes</a>, cartoony games that take much greater liberties with what defines a shooter, while still managing to pack in plenty of challenge. Treasure's latest, <a data-ref-id=\"3030-23966\" href=\"/sin-punishment-star-successor/3030-23966/\" slug=\"sin-punishment-star-successor\">Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor</a>, falls squarely, and satisfyingly, in the latter category. The production quality can be underwhelming at times, and like its <a data-ref-id=\"3045-43\" href=\"/nintendo-64/3045-43/\" slug=\"nintendo-64\">N64</a> predecessor, it's a fleeting experience. But this game <i>moves</i>, it moves <i>fast</i>, and I found myself consistently surprised by the directions it moves <i>in</i>.<br/> <br/> Star Successor plays with the basic <a data-ref-id=\"3015-169\" href=\"/on-rails/3015-169/\" slug=\"on-rails\">on-rails</a> shooter concept that drove games like <a data-ref-id=\"3025-344\" href=\"/space-harrier/3025-344/\" slug=\"space-harrier\">Space Harrier</a> and <a data-ref-id=\"3025-461\" href=\"/panzer-dragoon/3025-461/\" slug=\"panzer-dragoon\">Panzer Dragoon</a>, allowing you to move around the area of the screen while the game assumes control of both the movement through the environment as well as the perspective of the camera. Star Successor's dynamic use of the camera is one of its greatest strengths, allowing it to transition, at will, between horizontal, vertical, and behind-the-back perspectives. The wild variety of environments play up this aspect, and like a good roller coaster ride, it can make for a delightfully disorienting experience as floors turn into ceilings and up becomes sideways. Regardless of its fancy footwork, this is still a shooter, so you'll logically spend most of your time in Star Successor shooting, usually while simultaneously trying to dodge a near-constant barrage of incoming fire. You've also got a melee attack should enemies get too close, as well as a powered-up shot that's good for crowd control or particularly stubborn enemies.\u00a0<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1284399-sin_26punishment2_06_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1284399\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56441717791411\" data-width=\"815\" style=\"width: 815px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1284399-sin_26punishment2_06_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1284399\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1284399-sin_26punishment2_06_1_.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0SHOOT SHOOT SHOOT</figcaption></figure>     The pacing of this game is relentless, and it forces you to make the most of your ability to move about the screen independently of where you're aiming. In the back half of the game, I found myself using the game's quick-dodge ability almost constantly to avoid the hail of enemy fire. The game offers a number of control options, though I found that using the <a data-ref-id=\"3055-1304\" href=\"/wii-remote/3055-1304/\" slug=\"wii-remote\">Wii Remote</a> to aim and the Nunchuk to move was my favored setup, in part because I found the analog sticks on the <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2522\" href=\"/classic-controller-support/3015-2522/\" slug=\"classic-controller-support\">Classic</a> or <a data-ref-id=\"3015-2523\" href=\"/gamecube-controller-support-on-wii/3015-2523/\" slug=\"gamecube-controller-support-on-wii\">GameCube</a> Controllers too sluggish to keep up with Star Successor's frantic action. As someone who, due to the overall level of difficulty, tends to enjoy Treasure games in concept more than in practice, I'll admit here that I played Star Successor on the game's easiest difficulty. Generally speaking, I breezed through most of the game, though I also found it too intense and exhausting to play for very long stretches. But even on the easiest difficulty, I still found myself snagged on boss fights, totally, albeit temporarily, baffled by how to proceed.\u00a0<br/> <br/> So, a thing about boss battles in Star Successor. There are a lot of them. Like, I very probably spent more time battling bosses than I did the cannon fodder in between those big encounters. Treasure's not afraid to just stack one screen-filling, camera-spinning boss fight right after another, cleanse the palate with something that more closely approximates a traditional shooter level, and then on to another boss fight. It's something that contributes significantly to the game's relentlessness, which is itself a characteristic that suits a shooter particularly well. Also, the bosses are almost consistently nuts, with a variety that borders on the psychedelic. You'll do battle with a drippy, orifice-covered, building-sized biomechanical nightmare; a giant flying sand-tiger-eagle monster; an impossibly huge, robot-and-missile-spewing super battleship that floats in lava; a mind-bogglingly complex space station draped in lasers; and a samurai-space-horse-god demon, to name just a few.\u00a0<br/><br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1284393-sin_26punishment2_12_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1284393\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.56441717791411\" data-width=\"815\" style=\"width: 815px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.4%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/9589/1284393-sin_26punishment2_12_1_.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1284393\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1284393-sin_26punishment2_12_1_.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/9589/1284393-sin_26punishment2_12_1_.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0SHOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOT</figcaption></figure>     Sin &amp; Punishment: Star Successor isn't a lengthy experience, and all told I probably spent four or five hours playing through the story. You can also play the game cooperatively, though the second player's presence in the game is limited to their on-screen targeting reticle, and even then, I found the additional action more distracting than helpful. Really, the key to wringing the most value out of this game, like most shooters, lies in an innate desire on the player's behalf to repeatedly work through the game on harder and harder difficulty settings. If that's not in your DNA, Star Successor might not represent the greatest value for you.<br/> <br/> More than its length, though, I found myself underwhelmed by certain aspects of the game's presentation. For all its speed, Star Successor makes some noticeable sacrifices with the clarity of its textures and the level of detail in the environments, and much of the color in the game seems oddly desaturated as well. Usually you're moving too fast to notice, but it makes the already-stilted cutscenes that much more awkward. Some stiff voice work contributes to this as well, though the propulsive synthesizer soundtrack does its part in redeeming the overall sound design.<br/><br/> The past decade has been pretty lean for shooters, which have survived by pleasing the weird whims of an increasingly niche audience.

The premise is that they're trying to accurately look at combatants over the years, from knights to ninjas, and determining which type of combat was the best. In the game, this translates into <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1543\" href=\"/viking/3015-1543/\" slug=\"viking\">viking</a> vs. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1632\" href=\"/native-american/3015-1632/\" slug=\"native-american\">apache</a>, <a data-ref-id=\"3015-1291\" href=\"/knight/3015-1291/\" slug=\"knight\">knight</a> vs. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-216\" href=\"/samurai/3015-216/\" slug=\"samurai\">samurai</a>, or... yeah... <a data-ref-id=\"3015-445\" href=\"/pirates/3015-445/\" slug=\"pirates\">pirate</a> vs. <a data-ref-id=\"3015-12\" href=\"/ninja/3015-12/\" slug=\"ninja\">ninja</a>. It's a clever idea, but the mechanics of this high-damage fighting game don't lead to a lot of interesting depth, making it all fall flat.<br/> <br/>   The core of the fighting involves high, mid, and low attacks that combo together for short two-to-four hit strings. A stamina meter prevents you from just running up in your opponent's face and attacking forever, and every character has a limited number of projectiles (the ninja has stars, the pirate has muskets) that can be launched with the tap of a button. Attacks will occasionally lop off an arm, leg, or head, but even basic four-hit combos can deplete an opponent's entire life bar. To put it mildly, the rounds usually don't last very long, and it usually comes down to the player that made the first up-close mistake getting ripped apart.<br/> <br/>   That means that playing defense can be pretty important. There's a regular block that'll stop incoming attacks (though characters that don't have shields can't block projectiles), and you can combine that block with the attack buttons to attempt to parry incoming attacks. Guessing which height the opponent is attacking with isn't especially easy, but when you parry, the game slows down and gives you a free hit... which can completely end a match in many cases.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1424116-shot3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1424116\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.57766990291262\" data-width=\"618\" style=\"width: 618px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:57.8%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/8/87790/1424116-shot3.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1424116\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/8/87790/1424116-shot3.jpg\"></a><figcaption>Waiting for the enemy to slip up can be tedious.\u00a0</figcaption></figure>     There's something cool about the violent and harsh nature of how <a data-ref-id=\"3030-29790\" href=\"/deadliest-warrior-the-game/3030-29790/\" slug=\"deadliest-warrior-the-game\">Deadliest Warrior</a> plays, but its quick rounds aren't especially satisfying. Part of this is the animation's fault, which makes the strikes look weak. And since the game slows down for a second to emphasize parries and round-ending strikes, it can be difficult to tell them apart.<br/> <br/>   There's an arcade mode and a few different ways to play offline, as well as a few online modes for ranked, unranked, and tournaments. There appear to be some serious issues with the online as of this writing, as the game typically doesn't connect me with another player when I attempt a quick match, and creating a match and letting someone eventually join usually ends with a \"player has left the match\" message as soon as the fight is finished loading up. Going through all of the player matching hassle for a couple of quick-death rounds makes it all feel like way more trouble than it's worth. Other issues include a versus screen bug that sometimes shows the apache, even though you're playing as the ninja. The whole thing feels a little amateurish in execution.<br/> <br/>   Deadliest Warrior isn't entirely without merit, as the speedy nature of the fights along with the constant dismemberments make it kind of funny. But the technical issues surroundng the action make the game's $10 asking price feel pretty steep.

The story of this grim, gorgeous puzzle platformer's meteoric rise from Independent Games Fest honoree to triumph of the downloadable format is one I think people will talk about for a while. At least I hope they do; the razor-like precision of the design and starkly minimalist visual style create a short but indelible experience that deserves to appear before a lot of eyes. I know I had a hard time putting it out of my head for a while after I finished it.<br/> <br/> In the simplest terms, Limbo is a side-scrolling action game featuring a little boy looking for his sister in the big spooky forest. I only know that from reading a descriptive blurb somewhere; beyond the menus, the game itself uses no words (written or spoken) to communicate any sort of story. It doesn't even have real music, just a sublimely rendered ambient soundscape. And it doesn't need any of that stuff. You wake up in the woods, and off you go into an increasingly weird, oppressive, sinister dream world. Your sole occupation is to run left to right and try to avoid all the myriad ways this awful wilderness is trying to kill you, and the game focuses all of its efforts on enabling that single objective.<br/> <br/>     You won't manage to avoid most of those dangers the first time, because so much of Limbo's action centers on brutally immediate, unforgiving environmental hazards. A blade might come swinging out of nowhere and slice you in half, or a gigantic spider could impale you on a wickedly sharp leg almost before you realize it's there. There's really never a moment when you're not in danger of meeting some grisly end or other, and most of those ends you will not see coming. Note however that the timing and triggers in each scenario are the same every time, so getting through the game requires a lot of trial and error, dying to some unforeseen menace two, three, four times before you work out exactly what you need to do and how fast you need to do it to keep yourself alive and continue on.<br/> <br/> <figure data-align=\"left\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404075-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_57.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404075\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404075-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_57.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404075\"><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404075-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_57.jpg\"></a><figcaption>\u00a0Playing this is way more taxing than you  might suspect. \u00a0 \u00a0 </figcaption></figure>There are plenty of puzzles that don't require any deft controller work out of you but will tax the hell out of your problem-solving. So you won't necessarily die to these, but you might be totally, maddeningly baffled by a few of the tougher ones until you hit on solutions that are so abstract in a few cases they felt like they rivaled anything in <a data-ref-id=\"3030-20716\" href=\"/braid/3030-20716/\" slug=\"braid\"> Braid</a>. The game steadily introduces new environmental mechanics like water, gravity, and magnetism through the end of the game, so you never feel like you're doing the exact same thing twice. Every puzzle is keyed to the unique environment it's taking place in, almost like an adventure game. It's evident one or more people put a ton of thought into every single thing you do in this game. It constantly challenges and rewards you.<br/> <br/> In case it's not clear already, Limbo is a really hard game, probably too hard for casual players to make it through. But the extreme difficulty is bearable because everything in the game behaves in a very measured, deliberate way, especially the boy himself. He runs, jumps, climbs, and moves objects at a steady and predictable rate that feels really natural when you control him. That makes it easy to gauge timing and distance for your jumps and other moves. And everything in the game obeys a fairly realistic physics model that gives the gameplay a weird sort of tactile feel. Also, there's a checkpoint about every five feet, so you can almost instantly go from dying to retrying the thing you died on. Death is no burden here, just a means to further exploring each obstacle. Taken purely by volume this isn't a long game, but you'll feel like you've gotten plenty out of it by the time you've worked out every puzzle and survived every challenge.<br/> <br/><figure data-align=\"right\" data-embed-type=\"image\" data-img-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404053-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404053\" data-resize-url=\"\" data-resized=\"\" data-size=\"medium\" data-ratio=\"0.5625\" data-width=\"1280\" style=\"width: 1280px\"><a class=\"fluid-height\" style=\"padding-bottom:56.3%\" href=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/original/0/669/1404053-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_35.jpg\" data-ref-id=\"1300-1404053\"><img class=\"js-lazy-load-image\" data-src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404053-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_35.jpg\" src=\"data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==\"><noscript><img src=\"http://static.giantbomb.com/uploads/scale_medium/0/669/1404053-limbo_esrb_t_720p30_st_6300kbps_35.jpg\"></noscript></a><figcaption>\u00a0I can't think of a way this game could look any better than it does.</figcaption></figure>     The game is a joy to behold in every aspect. There are no colors, just black, white, and shades of grey, but it gets an astonishing amount of mileage out of this limited visual economy. Everything--characters, objects, background elements--is seen only in silhouette, which must have saved a ton of work on the art side. It also has the peripheral benefit of giving the game a wonderfully stark, striking appearance that, coupled with super animation and a grain effect, gives the game a sort of silent-film quality. Actually, a lot of things about Limbo seem cinematically influenced, even little elements like the way it jump cuts back to gameplay when you die. Similar to the art style, the sound design is subtle and reserved, but it perfectly serves to bring your surroundings to life. It would be a great game no matter what it looked like, but the the sublime production values make this a transcendent experience.<br/> <br/> Limbo has a transportive quality that's hard to articulate. It so expertly realizes both its internal gameplay logic and its prevailing aesthetic that it almost creates a sort of reverie as you play, fully removing you from your physical environment and plopping you into this cold, mesmerizing other land. Though you'll find it's a tough place to survive, it might also be one you're in no hurry to leave behind.

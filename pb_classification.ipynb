      "We wish to perform text classification and regression on GameSpot video game reviews. The classification will take the form of labeling each review as either \"positive\" or \"negative\" based on its numerical score and training/optimizing various classifiers to predict \"positive\" versus \"negative\" sentiment based on review text. This classification goal was inspired by the application of Naive Bayes classification to Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews (\"fresh\" versus \"rotten\") in the Bayesian Tomatoes exercise from AC209 Fall 2013. Here extend this prior work in several ways: (1) we apply Naive Bayes classification to video game reviews from GameSpot rather than movie reviews from Rotten Tomatoes (2) we apply feature-cleaning techniques such as regular expressions and stemming to the video game review corpus (3) we apply random forest classification and compare its results to those of Naive Bayes classification (4) we attempt to predict numerical review scores using k nearest neighbors regression."

      "In any machine learning task, especially classification, it is extremely important to establish a baseline accuracy for the *simplest possible model*. In our case, the simplest possible model corresponds to guessing that all reviews are positive or all reviews are negative, without any examination of the review text. If we choose our threshold for \"positive\" versus \"negative\" incorrectly, we will end up with an unbalanced set of examples for which it is difficult to interpret accuracy scores. For example, in the classic fraud detection problem, 99.99% of examples could be non-fraudulently, and therefore a trivial solution can produce 99.99% nominal accuracy, depending on the accuracy metric used. In order to avoid the subtleties introduced by unbalanced examples, we will choose the boundary between \"positive\" and \"negative\" reviews which makes the examples maximally balanced. Below is code showing how we choose the boundary between positive and negative reviews."
